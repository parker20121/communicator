Campus mourns lives lost during holiday season 



by Carrie Anne Leathers, 
Chiel Reporter 

tour unreljicd accidents and 
illnesses look the lives of three 
professors and mo of iheir famil&gt;' 
members in December and early 
January. 

On Friday, Dec. 1 1, David 
GoUob, chair and associate profes- 
sor of accounting and finance, lost 
his life after working at IPHW since 
the fall of 1991. 

"He was a committed, responsi- 
ble, good friend who truly loved 
his famil&gt; friends, and work," it 
was said at his funeral, 

"He ne\er stinted when asked 
to give of himself an never held 
back when there was a job to be 
done. His passing is a iraged&gt;' for 



all who knew him and he will be 
missed be&gt;ond description." 

During lunch on the same day 
as Gotlob's death, Ste\c 
Hollander, associate pro- 
fessor of English and lin- 
guistics, collapsed in the 
IPFW cafeteria when his 
heart failed. 

He never regained 
consciousness before his 
death two da&gt;'s later, on 
Sunday. 

Hollander had been 
with IPFW since the fall 
of 1968. 

"Steve was m&gt; best 
friend here. He is irre- 
placeable," said Mike 
Downs, chair and associ- 
ate professor of political science. 
"There are so many different 
things he did for so many different 



kinds of people that 1 don't think 
there is anybody who can do what 

he did." 

In April of 1998. 
Hollander became 
aware of his lung 
cancer and began* 
treaimeni for it. 

Although the 
tumor in his lung 
was o\ er 90 per- 
cent gone, his 
heart failed him 
due to the stress 
of chemotherapy. 
"Me was a real 
force for good 
writing and good 
grammar on the 
campus, and 

asn't afraid to criti- 
ho did stupid things 



"The deaths 

deprive us 

01 three 

valuable 

faculty 

colleagues." 

-Michael Wartell, 
IPFW Chancellor 



because he 
ci/e people 
or mean things, he made people 



prone to do those things and 
impro\e their performance," 
Downs said. "I miss him e\er&gt;da&gt;." 

Onl&gt;' a few weeks later, on Jan. 
3, Kathleen Rassuli, associate pro- 
fessor of marketing, died in an 
automobile accident in 

l'enns&gt;hania. 

Her daughter was also killed in 
the crash. Her husband Ali Rassuli, 
associate professor of economics, 
survived. 

"The deaths deprive us of three 
\'aluable faculty colleagues," 
Chancellor Michael Wartell said. 
"Their positi\'0 contributions to 
their students and to the campus 
will be surel&gt;' missed." 

Wartell noted that although the 
losses are tragic for IPFW. it is 
much worse for the families and 
lo\'ed ones of those lost. 

According to Wartell, all of the 



professors devoted considerable 
amounts of themsehes to the cam- 
pus. 

Besides these tragedies, on 
Thursday Dec. 10, a South Side 
student Vitalij' Le&gt;bman was hit by 
a car and killed. 

His father, Ye\"genij- Lejbman, 
is an associate facult\ of mathe- 
matics at IPFW. 

For facult)' seeking help and 
guidance because of these losses,

IPSGA calculator 
program a success 



by Mishanna Wood, 
News Edflof 

The first calculator 
runtal program conducted 
b&gt;' Student Government 
shows a promising future. 

As noon came around 
on the second da&gt;' of class- 
es, the total supply of 22 
graphing calculators had 
been rented out. 

"I'm renting a calculator 
so I don't have to buy one. 
They are \ery expensive," 
IPFW sophomore, Carui 
Olsanski said, 

Due to the newness of 
the program. Student 
Government limited the 
amount of calcula- 
tors purchased. 

According to HoH&gt;- 
Logan, administrative assis- 
tant at IPSGA, there is a 
short waiting list. 

"This is a much bigger 
program than I thought it 
would be." Logan said. 

Students can come into 
the Student Go\ernment 
office on the second floor 
of Walb in Rm. 225 to sign 
up, 

IPSGA is looking into 
funds to purchase more cal- 
culators for the students' 
needs. 

Tomorrow from noon to 
5 p.m., Logan will be calling 
those on the waiting list if 
more calculators have been 
purchased. 

If a call is not received 
bv Logan, potential recipi- 
ents can call the IPSGA 
office at 481-6586 for an 
arrival date. 

"I think it's a wonderful 
program. It makes people 
more open to using the 
graphing calculator early. 



When you get to advanced 
concepts it is easier to 
check your work if you 
alreadj' know the basic 
workings of the calculator," 
Da\id Love, teaching assis- 
tant for Math 113, said. 

The process to rent a 
calculator is simple. 

There is a SIO fee per 
semester. 

Students are gi\en a 
small contract slating the 
rental terms. 

No refunds are accepted 
for the rental fee. 

If an&gt;' of the accessories, 
(rechargeable battery, 
instruction booklet or 
attachment cord) are dam- 
aged or missing, students 
are responsible for a 
replacement cost. 

Calculators must be 
returned by May 7 to Walb 
Km. 225 or to the Student 
Activities Office, Walb Rm. 
231. 

Renters will be fined S5 
for every week the calcula- 
tor is late. 

In addition to the fee, 
the Bursars Office will hold 
transcripts and make regis- 
tration impossible until the 
fees are paid. 

Under special circum- 
stances, students may call 
the Student Government 
office for an extension. 

Originally, IPSGA limited 
rental to the first three 
days of the semester. 

According to Joe 
Schroeder, IPSGA president, 
the rental has been extend- 
ed to whatever the student 
demand is. 

"We're going to keep 
renting as long as the stu- 
dents keep coming in," 
Schroeder said.

TOPIC: 

Dr. Kevorkian and 
euthanasia 

WHAT WE THINK: 

Either you have to let 
him do it or you should 
stop putting your pets to 
sleep. 



Everyone knows what 
kind of trouble Dr. Jack 
Kevorkian has been getting 
into with his practice of per- 
forming acts of assisted sui- 
cide or euthanasia or "mercy 
killings." 

Once again, Kevorkian 
has been charged with mur- 
der after another assisted 
suicide. Kevorkian now sits 
in a Michigan prison awaiting 
the outcome of his first trial 
after the state outlawed 
assisted suicide. 

We reaily don't see what 
the big deal is with what he's 
doing anyways. Every day 
thousands of people are hav- 
ing the life of one of their 
family members snuffed out 
unnaturally. Of course it isn't 
in the exact means that 



Kevorkian is doing it. but it 
is in a fairly similar method. 

The family member we 
were actually talking about is 
the family pet. Anyone that 
has grown up or has lived 
with a pet for any long 
amount of time has found 
some attachment and sense 
of family with that ppt. In 
many cases, people who are 
lonely often have only a pet 
for support. 

So why is it that we are 
allowed to terminate the life 
of a family pet and not the 
life of another family mem- 
ber that is suffering a simi- 
lar, if not more severe ill- 
ness? Most people will quick- 
ly utter that they are 
jus t animals. 

We would argue that they 
are more than animals. Over 
many centuries, cats and 
dogs have been taken out of 
the wild to coexist with 
humans as their companions. 
These pets serve no other 
purpose than to just be there 
for people. 

Pets are personal friends 
to people. That's why we give 
them names and take their 
pictures as if they were our 
children. 

Pets are different from 
other animals such as cows. 
Cows serve as a means of 



nourishment for a large part 
of our society. 

People have a general 
understanding that cows are 
bred for consumption and 
that they are expected to be 
slaughtered. 

Pets aren't seen in that 
same light. Most pet owners 
feel as though they have lost 
a member of the family when 
one of their pets dies or is 
put to sleep. 

We're not suggesting that 
if your child starts biting 
people you should have him 
put to sleep, but rather that 
we need to be more sensitive 
to the wishes of the people 
who are suffering through 
terminal illnesses. 

How different is letting a 
relative choose to end their 
life peacefully from putting a 
pet to sleep? Not much, but 
at least your relative has a 
choice in the matter, 

Putting your animal to 
sleep because it is dying and 
not letting someone choose 
to end their life is one of the 
ways that our society is very 
hypocritical. 

A decision has to be 
made as to which is right 
Our loved ones should be 
allowed to die by their own 
wishes.

The weather has 
been horrible for the 
last few weeks, and ! 
would like to take this 
time to reflect on one 
of the worst experi- 
ences that I have had 
lately. 

The morning after 
the first large batch of 
snow fell 1 had to drive 
out to open the store 
that 1 work in. I have 
this little sports car 
that probably sits a 
couple of inches off of 
the ground, i knew that 
1 wasn't going to be 
able to muscle my way 
around with the little 4 
cylinder engine that I 
have, so 1 decided to 
plot out a route 
through the parking lot 
that I park at. 

One entrance was 
completely blocked by 
the snow that the city 
plowed off of the street, 
but the other entrance 
appeared as though a 
few trucks have driven 
through there. 1 decid- 
ed that the second 
choice would probably 
be the best. 

I pulled my car 
close to the second 
entrance and saw a 
fairly large patch of 
snow. 1 thought that 1 
might have to get a lit- 



tle speed up before ! 
went over it, so 
backed up and let ii 
rip. 

I'd hate to say it 



their tinted windows, 1 
would be sure that they 
were snickering at me. 
This really irritated me. 
City vehicles would 



but 1 didn't make it drive by even though 
through that patch of my car was sticking out 
snow. 1 pretty well into the street. 



buried the front end of 
the car in the snow. It 
wouldn't move. 

looked through 



It just made me 
wonder where the good 
Samaritans were or if 
there really were any in 



the contents of my car existence anymore, 
and saw the only thing I stopped to help 

1 had that could be two other motorists on 
used for any sort of my way home from 
digging tool was the work, and no one even 
long-handled window helped me in the morn- 
scraper, ing when I needed it. 1 

I dug with it for was stuck on a normal- 
about 20 
minutes and 
gave up. 1 
knew that 1 
was going to 
be late for 
work. 

1 turned 
on my haz- 
ard lights 
and tried to 
signal pass- 
ing motorists 
for help. One 
by one, 

everyone in 
their trucks 
and utility 
vehicles 
passed by. If 
I could see 
through 



ly busy street, so why 
wouldn't anyone help 
me? I'm sure that there 
are a lot of stories that 
people have heard as 
why not to stop to help 
someone in this para- 
noid world, but those 
are one in a million 
tales. 

If this world has 
any chance of making 
it, people are going to 
need to learn how to 
help each other out and 
how to get along. 

If we can accom- 
plish this one simple 
task, then everything 
else will fall into place.

ofT the "siudeni.him" at ihe end of the link not-so-well chought out ideas I came up with 
above. that might give an answer to that question: 



Surprise, surprise. If you are reading 
this, then apparently i can do this for a bit 
longer than 1 originally thought. Finall&gt; , 
with much help from a certain Adam 
Barrone, I was able to find many interesting 
web sites. 

Some of the sites were people with a sin- 
gle page, bul considering how few people 
e\en bothered to start a web page, that's still 
impressi\e. In the directory that I was led to 
by the an informative e-mail I recei\ed 
before finals. I was able to find about 71 
pages. Here are the ones that top my list,

at IPFW. If you know someone who has a 
home page but don't know where to find it, 
you can look here. 

This was set up, I'm guessing, by the 
same Adam Barrone who told me about the

1 happen to know the author of this site, 
and 1 was impressed with his work. Perhaps 
the picture is slightly distorted, but this site 
has a treasure trove of Jax-a applets. It also 
has an abundance of animated GIF's and 
other cand&gt; for the e&gt;e. 

I'm sure Chris wouldn't mind if you 
"borrowed" a few of his GIF's for &gt;our own 
personal enjo)meni. I'm sure he wouldn't 
mind &gt;ou \ isiiing his page more than once, 
either, or if you pressed the "refresh" button 
numerous times to increase his site's hits. 
NOTE: I didn't do it.

This is a very interesting page, to say 
the least. This site includes information on 
the proposed man-made island called 
Oceana. Why do we need another island. 



1.) Furby refuge. Furbies happen to be really 
annojing and soon they will need a place of 
refuge from parents who regret ever mort- 
gaging their house for one. 

2.) Ego inflation. What better way for 
Clinton to boost his spirits than to call 
Canada one day and sa&gt;- "After we built 
about 300 man-made islands, we recalculat- 
ed the size of our nation and it turns out 
WE'RE 50 SQLIARE METERS lARGER THAN 
YOU!" ducstion: Who is in charge of 
Canada? 

3.) Criminal confinement. This would be the 
ultimate punishment. What better wa&gt;' to 
punish hardcore thugs than b&gt;' throwing 
them on an island created b&gt;' the same peo- 
ple who can't e\en make roads last more

worse is if a trio of freshman IPFW engineers

Department of Theatre holds auditions for 
'Mass /appeal' and 'The Hot L Baltimore' 



IPFW's Department of Theatre 
announces open auditions for Bill 
Davis' "Mass Appeal" and Lanford 
Wilson's "The Hot L Baltimore" in the 
Williams Theatre on Sunday, Jan. 17. 

All theatre majors are required 
to prepare a monologue to be read 
at 12:30 p.m. that day. 

Readings for "The Hot L 
Baltimore" will begin at 2 p.m.. fol- 
lowed b&gt; readings for Mass Appeal 
at 3:30 p.m. 

Students as well as members of 
the community are welcome to 
participate. 

"NIass Appeal," directed b&gt; John 
C. Hermes, is a touching and funnj' 
examination of the nature of friend- 
ship, courage, and love as the priest 
of a prosperous Catholic congrega- 
tion experiences disruption when an 
intense and idealistic young semi- 
narian arri\'es at his church. 

The pla&gt; will run March 19, 20, 
26, and 27 in Studio Theatre,,. , 

The roles available are' for two 



men. one in his twenties and one in 
his forties. 

"The Hot L Baltimore," directed 
b&gt; Craig A. Humphrej', takes place in 
the Iobb&gt;' of a rundown hotel, so 
seedy that it has lost the letter "e" 
from its marquee. 

The drama is of everyday 
encounters and conversations that 
often overlap into a poignant, pow- 
erful call for America to recover its 
lost values and restore itself in the 
world's eyes. 

The play will be performed in 
Williams Theatre on April 16, 17, 23. 
and 24. 

There are roles available for 
eight men and six women, ages 18- 
70. For those familiar with the p\ay, 
the role of "the Girl" is not av-ailable. 

For more information regarding 
either of these two plays, please con- 
tact 48 1-6551 for details.

Humanitarianistic Hero Hiding From Society 




Adyertisine; Works 

kC\/^/\Zx 481-6583- 



by Adam Taylor 
Features Editor 



Perfertion. That was the 
only word ihal passed 
through Bill's mind as he sat 
down and stared at the plate 
he had prepared for himself. 

Green beans, mashed 
potatoes, a turkey breast 
smothered in gravy, and a 
glass of champagne all 
worked over his senses to 
preoccupy his mind with 
something besides the bitter 
fact that this day was his 
twelfth straight 
Thanksgiving alone. 

Perfection, he thought to 
himself, was a rare item 
indeed. It was almost never 
that anything combined with 
anything else could bring 
about such a wonderful 
combination. 

He began to wonder 
what it was about that mea! 
that seemed so perfect, Was 
it the wa&gt;' all of the colors 
mixed so well together? 

The waj' exerjthing 
smelled upon blending their 
individual aromas into one 
collective fragrance? 
Perhaps it was the way in 
which the food was prepared 
and how ever&gt;'thing seemed 
to get done at the same time. 

No, Bill thought, perfec- 
tion is best described in a 
different way-a way in 
which words cannot 
describe. 

He didn't know what it 
was about his dinner that 
made it so appealing but 
whatever it was put a smile 
across his face. 

As he began to eat his 
dinner, he peered out into 
the darkness of the e\'ening 
at the snow that pervaded 
the nighttime sky. 

First he was reminded of 
the work it would be to sho^'- 
el his driveway and side- 
walks in the morning and 
how cold it was going to be 
during his designated \s1nler 
labor work time. 

As the snow continued, 
though, and Bill continued 
to gaze out his window, his 
thoughts of arduous, frozen 
work were soon replaced 
with a feeling of warm isola- 
tion drifting from the win- 
dow pane and fireplace to 
find a common resting place 
in his heart. 

Finishing up his sumptu- 
ous meal. Bill resolved to fin- 
ish the dishes later and to 
settle down in a comfortable 
chair and enjoy the remain- 
der of his snow&gt; 
entertainment. 

After all, it was going to 
be d lonel&gt; night with just 
the company of his own 
thoughts to brighten the 
e\ening. 

After a short while, the 
firewood supply Bill had pro- 
vided for himself was 
exhausted and he was made 
(through his lack of wishing 
to lose the moment) to 
restock his stores using those 
outside. 

He threw on a pair of 
boots, a coat, and a pair of 
gloves and quickly embarked 
upon his chore. 

The e\ening proved to 
be quite a bit chillier than 
Bill had originally imagined 
and, being repeatedly stung 
by gusts of wind, he was 
soon standing hy the fire 
with his Usk dune and his 



bones frozen. 

Despite his pre\'ious 
laments of loneliness, he 
soon realized that whoever 
was being made to endure 
the frigid temperatures of 
the outdoors that night sure- 
ly had it worse than he 
did — especiallj' those that 
had no shelter to speak of 
whatsoever. 

Those people, after all, 
didn't even ha\e the hope of 
lodging to look forward to, 
let alone shelter from that 
night's fierce i\ind. 

Bill quicklj forgot what- 
ever thoughts of loneliness 
he had previousl&gt; enter- 
tained as he sat back and 
contemplated this new 
thought — the thought that 
people were freei^ing to 
death while he sat comfort- 
ably next to his fire. 

He could imagine the 
feeling of helplessness those 
poor people must feel at 
every gust and how hopeless 
they must be knowing that 
none in town would take 
them in, not e\en on this 
day of celebration. 

Continuing his thinking. 
Bill resolved to make a dona- 
tion to the local homeless 
fund when he woke up in the 
morning. 

After all, he didn't have 
anything else to spend his 
money on. It may as well go 
to a decent cause. 

Looking up at the clock, 
he saw it was late and finally 
decided his mental holiday 
should come to an end. 

After another glass of 
champagne, Bill speedil\' 
cleaned his dishes and went 
to bed. 

It had been a long da&gt; 
and it was best to see the 
rest of it through the ej'es of 
the Sandman. 

After all. he thought, .it 
■ is always tough tosaj' "what 
will happen from daj to daj. 
Closing his ej-es. Bill finallj- 
fell asleep. 

The next morning Bill 
woke up at 10, read&gt;' to face 
another daj- of work. 

He decided to put off 
the tedious job of shoveling 
his sidewalk and driveway, 
finding the temperature too 
cold for his liking. 

Instead, he decided to 
get to work on his latest web 
development project. After 
all, his work can be verj' 
relaxing at times — especially 
on a cold, lifeless day. 

Getting into the web page 
designing business was defi- 
nitely a good career mo\e 
for him, Bill thought to 
himself. 

He could make his own 
hours, he got paid a lot of 
money, and he was basicallj' 
his own boss. 

To top it all off, he was 
doing something he enjoyed 
within the solitude of his 
home and, again, he was 
making good money for it. 

Bill sat down to his com- 
puter with a cup of coffee 
and clicked the power on. 
Waiting patiently for the 
computer to finish loading, 
he immediately connected 
himself to the Internet, 
checking to see if anyone he 
knew from his Internet pager 
was on betore getting to 
work on his latest web site. 

Feeling disappointed at 
finding no one, he opened 
up his picture animator and 
nrk. 



Three hours 
after starting Bill 
was already done, 
or at least he was 
as far as he knew. 
He was never 
completely clone 
until the business 
for which h e 
w a s work- 
ing approved of 
the page. 

After he got 
the appro\'al, all 
Bill needed to do was regis- 
ter the page with the search 
engines and send his con- 
tractors the bill for the work 
neither of which took more 
than a couple of minutes. 

Looking for his phone 
book. Bill glanced out of his 
window and looked at his 
dri\ewa&gt;'. "Looks like I'll be 
getting to you todaj' after 
alt," Bill thought to himself. 

Grabbing his phone 
book, he returned to his 
desk and called up the book- 
store that had hired him last 
week. 

"Rothmeir Books, this is 
Susan, how ma&gt; 1 help you?' 
the voice on the other end 
blurted out in one long 
monotonous sentence. 

"Hi Susan, this is Bill 
Ferguson. Is Mr. Rothmeir 
around by any chance?" 

"Hold on a second please, 
sir, and I'll get him for you." 

Bill lit up a cigarette as he 
waited for Frank Rothmeir, 
local bookstore magnate and 
one of his current emplo&gt;'- 
ers, to come to the phone so 
the two of them could wrap 



"Nearly six 

figures in my checking account 

and I'm just 

letting it sit there," 

Bill thought to himself. 



page, and I'll talk to you 
later." 

"Yeah, nice working with 
you." 

Bill registered 
Rothmeir's site with all of 
the major search engines 
and sent an e-mail to the 
community Internet ser\'ice 
provider notifying them of 
Rothmeir's new page for the 
area business section on 
their home page. 

As he looked over their 
home page, he saw a link to 
a page for a community- 
homeless shelter. 

Remembering his resolu- 
tion from the previous night. 
Bill wrote down their address 
as he went for his check- 
book. 

"Nearly si.x figures in m&gt;- 
checking account and I'm 
just letting it sit there," Bill 
thought to himself. 

"There are other people 
that need this money more 
than I do." 

After thinking for a 
minute. Bill wrote out a 
check for a quarter of his

"Great, great. That's

Jordan Retires 



According to CNN and Yahoo! 
News, Michael Jordjn announced 
his retirement yesterday, bringing a 
second end to his wondrous career 
in the National Basketball 
Association. 

Jordan who retired in 1993 
returned in 1995 to his career 
with the Chicago Bulls 



organization. 

Since his return in 1995, Jordan 
helped the Bulls win three consecu- 
tive championships in 1996, 1997, 
and 1998, adding to his three previ- 
ous consecutive championships in 
1991, 1992. and 1993. 

Jordan's contributions to the 
game arc immense. 

Jordan is third on the all-time 
scoring list with 29.277 points 
behind Kareem Adbul-Jabbar and 
Wilt Chamberlain. 

Jordan is first on the a\eragc 
points per game list with a 31.5 
average. 

Jordan lea\es with 25 game 
winning shots, helped the Bulls win 
a record 72 games in the 1995-96 
season, led the league in storing 10 
times, has 11 All-Star appearances, 
and was named MVP Vive times. 

The Bulls averaged 6,365 fans 
per game when Jordan started his 
career. Since his third season, the 
Bulls have managed 542 consecu- 
tive sellouts. 

It is calculated that Jordan 



helped the league sell an additional 
S165 million in tickets. 

Jordan's contributions go deep- 
er than the NBA. Stock for Nike 
dropped 4 percent Tuesdaj' amid 
concerns that he might retire. 

It is calculated that he generat- 
ed SIO billion for the U.S. econom&gt;' 
according to Fortune Magazine. 

Forgetting the monej part, let's 
remember the excitement generated 
by Michael Jordan. 
Arguabl&gt;', Jordan is the best pla&gt;er 
to have ever played the game. 

The appeal is not generated so 
much bj' his statistics, but more by 
the aura and attitude he generated. 
He attracted many people to the 
game. 

His determination helped 
Chicago beat the odds last summer 
to win their third consecutive cham- 
pionship over the Utah Jazz. 

He had the winning shot that 
put the Bulls ahead for good. Under 
pressure and exhausted, he pulled 
through once again. 



Womens Basketball off to solid start 



by Brian Miller, 
Sports Edilof 



The Womens basket- 
ball season has not gone 
as smoothly as Coach Pam 
Bowden might have want- 
ed, but it is a team that is 
showing improvement and 
building itself into a solid 
threat in the GI VC. 

The team has shown 
much improvement within 
the last three weeks and is 
looking to get its first win 
under its belt. 

Led by a plethora of 
freshmen, none have 
impressed as much as the 
guard duo Kara Moore 
and Christy McMillin. 

Moore and McMillin 
have combined for more 
than 35 percent of the 
team^s offensive output 



and are among team lead- 
ers in most statistical cate- 
gories. 

However, the most 
important thing the two 
are getting out of this los- 
ing season is leadership 
abilities via senior captain 
Katie Bruening. 

Bruening exemplifies 
everything a successful 
college athlete should be. 

She is once again a 
member of the Academic 
Coach's Ust (3,0-3.49) and 
a leading scorer on the 
team, leading in both 
heart and mind. 

Game in and game 
out, Bruening gi\es all she 
has. Unfortunatelj', that 
tj'pe of leadership may 
not bring success this 
year, but in three &gt;ears, 
when the freshmen ha\e 



matured and the team has 
made the transition from 
pretender to contender. 

You have to believe 
the team's success can be 
pinned to that of Katie 
Breuning. 

Like the Mens team 
the Womens team also lost 
t\\'0 plajers this past week. 
Kristi Lamb (1.9 ppg, 2.8 
rpg) quit and Denise 
Walker (7.6 ppg, 5.2 rpg) 
didn't clear NCAA acade- 
mic requirements. 

Both pla&gt;ed inside 
roles for the Dons and will 
be looking to Mandy 
Lo\e!ess, Jenny Miller, 
Laura Douglas and Angle 
Womack to help out Core&gt;' 
Duncan. 

The team has great 
defensive play from Laura 
Douglas, who brings a "no 



fear" attitude almost 
Rodman-esque to the 
team. 

Superb play can also 
be found from freshman 
Angie Womack. 

Womack has com- 
bined physical prowess 
along with outstanding 
offense to give the Dons 
strength inside. 

Unfortunately for 
Bruening, her season has 
not been storybook. 

However, it is hard 
not to fall in love with a 
team that works hard, 
gi\es all that it has. and 
continues to enjoy playing 
a game that has made this 
state so popular.

Mens basketball loses four players 



Academics plays 
major role in 
Dons' downfall 

ty Brian Miller, 

Sports Editor 

The Mens Basketball

losses this year, like the team's 
two-point loss to Hillsdale, and 
the team's 72-69 loss to

Saturda\T which extended the 
Dons' losing streak to four. 

As if this weren't enough 
for Coach Williams and his 
team to concentrate on, anoth- 
er loss affected the team this 
time, not in the win-loss col- 
umn, but in the roster. 

Four of the team's pla\- 
ers ha\"e been ruled ineligible 
due to NCAA and IPFW athletic- 
academic guidelines 

Paul Biankenship, Core\ 
Evans, Rich Gawthrop and 
Mario Wujsang ha\e all been 
suspended this semester due to 
academic guidelines which will 
put them in the bleach- 
ers instead of on the 
bench. 

The team redshiried 
Scepter Brownlee, Benji 
Gibbs. and Jason 
Campbell earlier in the 
season. 

This lea\es onl)' six 
people on the team. 
1 hat's right, one person 
coming off the bench. 

Williams and IPFW tr&gt;' 

to do everything they 

an to prevent things 

ke this from happening, 

ut unfortunate!)-, if kids 

don't prioritize, it's 

tough to avoid the 

ine\itable. 

The school has set up 
stud)' tables, offered 
tutoring, provided an 
academic coach and 
en monitored class- 
room attendance. 

Ho\ve\er, Williams is 
till being blasted b)' 
both Fort Wayne news- 
papers for recruiting 
academic risks and los- 
ng athletes each )ear to 
academics. 

Although it is true 
that there is no excuse 



Mens Roster 
G- Steve Griffin

G- Randy Spicer 

F-Aaron ishman

C- Kedran Barnhiil 



for losing pla)'ers to academics, 
one can onl)- wonder what 
more coaches can do. 

After all, isn't it the 
same papers that ha\e blasted 
Carroll High School coach Rob 
Irwin for cutting a pla\er 
because of his academic and 
off-court manner? Some suc- 
ceed and some fail. This sea- 
son it backfired! Williams can't 
be blamed for gi\ing kids a 
chance. 

The kids who failed are 
the ones who have been hurt 
the most. 

I have seen this team 
play many games and I have to 
believe its family-like work 
ethic and approach will help 
them overcome other obstacles 
if they can stick together and 
sta) healthy. 

With the starting line-up 
still intact, the team will find a 
wa)' to gain more positives than 
negatives out of this ordeal and 
come out with a vengeance. 

This won't be an eas\ 
obstacle to oxercome, but ivith 
Adam Moore, Tyson Brit, and 
Ste\-e Griffin still on the fioor, 
this won't be a team to oxer- 
look and take lighth.
