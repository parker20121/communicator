adds lb 
Hastings 
"easy lo lalk lo, 
very profession- 
al." 
Hastings, who has 



;poken ai jusi over 500 campuses, 
says ihai in die pasi 16 years the 
crowds were always rather large. 

"Not because of me," be said. 
"Bui because of Ibe subject people 
are impressed by the reaiity of il and 
the amouni of documenlation." He 
also allribuies pan of ihc recent 
inieresi in UFOs lo a popular lelevi- 
sion show, "The X-Files." 

'There has always been an inier- 
esi in ihis subject, bui the "X-Fdes' 
especially helped raise interesL" 

Hastings has completed vast 
research on the subjecl of UFOs 
gaining much of his infonnaiion 
from govemmeni documents thai 
were noi available lo the public 
before die passing of the Freedom of 
Information AcL 

He has also inlerviewed former 
and currenl Air Force personnel 
aboui Ihe ibings they observed and 
ihe subsequent govemmeni cover- 



up 

"UFOs do exist, despite repeated 
denials by pubUc officials," Hastings 
said. 

'These mysterious officials are 
of the grcaiesi concern 10 Ibe bigh- 
esi levels of the U.S. Air Force and 
the Inielligence Community" 

Hastings said thai in 1967 he 
was in an air traffic control tower at 
Malmslrom Air Force, near Grcai 
FaUs. Mom., when Air Force jeis 
aiiempted lo inlercepl five UFOs 
which were being tracked on radar. 
The iniercepiion was unsuccessful. 
Since that incideni. Hastings has 
devoted countless hours researching 
UFOs and the govemmeni's "covert 
response" lo them. 

He says "The subject is of greai 
inieresi to me personally, (but) 1 
ihink the govemmeni is hiding 
somediing from people that could 
have a dramaiic effect on all of us." 



Hastings' research should cause 
even the mosi siubbom skeptic to 
pause and think about UFOs. 

He has over 600 pages of docu- 
ments to support his position. 

Hastings notes thai tixere are 
over 10,000 pages of documentation 
available to the public. 

Interested individuals can also 
obtain UFO facts by wniing to Fund 
for UFO Research, P.O. Box 277, 
Mount Rainier. MB. 

It IS a not-for-profit organization 
thai sells documents on UFOs. The 
money earned is used to fund more 
research on UFOs. 

Hastings wants people lo come 
lo the presentation with an open- 
mmd, and to keep the following in 
mind: 

"UFOs are not jusl in die reaim 
of Hollywood and Science fiction."

Fiction writer Janice Eidus will 
visu IPFW on Oct 27 lo perform a 
reading of her work. Eidus' reading 
will take place ai noon in Walb 
Union Room. 224 as pari of tbe 
IPFW Visiting Wriiers Series. 

The majority of Eidus works 
are set m New York City, where she 
was bom, raised and cuirendy hves 
She has wnten two collections of 
stories; "The Celiba y Club and 
"Viio Loves Gerald ne She has 
also written two no lI Urban 
Blues" and Faithful Rebec a 

Mary Ann tain iui as sunt 
professor of Engl sh at IPFW has 
met Eidus and ha^ used her work in 
her classes. 

"She has a far n-achmg imag 
nation." said Gun 

"The reader has empathy for 
characters diat they don t expect to 
feel anything lor She is also a 
humorous wnier 

Eidus' visit to IPFW may be rel 
evant lo the c^npu. current nu.rcs 
in diversity as he has chara tcrs 
from lots of d fferent background. 

She puts an ntcrcSlmg sp n on 
multicultural] sm 

Eidus' work seems to exemplify 
people who I vc beyond what other 
Ihiiik or expect of them 

For example Geraldinem V to 
Loves Geralchne has the potential 
to ^pcar very pathetic, waiting on 
her high school sweetbean to marry 
her decades later 

Buu because she is portrayed as 
having a life of her own, she ends 
up seeming very respectable and 
Vito marries her 

Eidus' work is published and 



sold through a San Francisco-based 
publisher and book store Uiat has its 
roots in the BeamUc era. 

City Lights publishing is a small 
press operation that focuses heavily 
on Uterary. artistic writers rather 
dian trying lo find the next best-sell- 
er 

Such notables as Lawrence 
Farlinghetii and Alan Ginsberg have 



ties to City Lights, 

"The works of Eidus have 
appeared in a number of journals 
and anthologies. 

Among die awards she has 
received are two O. Henry Prizes, a 
Pushcart Prize, a Redbook Award 
and a B. Dalton Fellowship, 

She has eamed many accolades 



as well, including the following 
from The San Francisco Review of 
Books: 

"Janice Eidus[works out] of Ibal 
strenuous laboratory of post modem 
irony and humor... Eidus takes 
chances and straddles the abyss 
between lost innocence and the 
always changmg future."

Student disgruntled about writer's beliefs 



"Just because you 

went and heard 

the beliefs doesn't 

mean anything, do 

you know that an 

atheist could attend 

a school like that." 



' To THE Editor: 

In response to Jeremy Ecenbarger's Sept. 25 col- 
How can credibility be established through atten- 
dance at a parochial Lutheran school? Just because you 
went and heard the beliefs doesn't mean anything. Do 
you know that an atheist could attend a school like thai. 
In fact. I believe ii happens a lot more than many would 
like to believe. 

Question for you? When is the last time you've 
read the Bible? What I'm getting at is tins; You are so 
consumed in the world and for that matter even 
. Dryden's ("A Layman's Faith") poem. 



Tbe world and the poem are Satan's turf and you're 
eating iu bud When was the last time you've eaten of. 
God? Read his word and received his Holy Spirit? Do, 
you believe there is a God? Do you believe Satan 
exists? 

For diat matter, do you believe there is good and 
evil? The question I leave you widi is this! 

Who are you following? Are you a slave or a set^'- 
vani? Think aboui what you're eating — lies. Thai's. 
Satan's food. Do you dig the taste?

Parents noed a boost too S^^^^'^*^ work as human beings, not as computers 



Hillary Rodham Chnton lumed 
50 this month, 

Chelsea is safe she is away at 
college and will not have to endure 
her moibei's mid-life crisis 

We are supportive of alternative 
lifestyles of older adults but many 
studenis wbo attend IPFW do not 
have the luxury of escaping tbe tor- 
ture of mid-life burnout our parents 
might face during our college 
careers. 

We go to college and work very 
hard towards our degree but some- 
times our parents are a distraction. 
Yes. we love them and admire them. 
It doesn't really matter what they 
do, our parents continue to amaze us 
as we enter the beginning of our 
lives We know that buying red 



sports cars is common but how 
about learning to rollerblade at 50 or 
bungy cord jump ai 46 ■* 

Perhaps ai this time in life, we 
envy them now the most because 
ihey are experiencing ibcir freedom 
and we warn them to share it. 

If only we had ihe lime to expe- 
rience these things Our parents are 
the ones now in our lives wbo do 
have real jobs while we slave away 
at night studying and or worldng. 

Let's admit it, they are in a bet- 
ter position to do more fun things 
and we hate to wimess it sometimes. 
it's not out of embarrassment but 
jealousy. 

We should help them and 
expand their possibilities for 
change. 



To the Editor: 

Mr. Osborne, your letter con- 
cerning the use of the cumpulers 
was very enlightening I sec that you 
are very upset wiih ihe faci thai 
computers are not available for use 
I know the frustration of walking alt 
over campus to find an open slot, 
r ve done it many times 
Unfortunately su, your comments 
are misdirected. You should not be 
educating the students on its sup- 
posed uses, should be inquiring 
form the university why there are 
only a certain number of computers. 

When this technology fee was 
introduced, e-mail and Internet 
searches were the main selling 
points. Students were (old that they 



would have unlimited access to 
these areas. Since its passing, the 
lechnology fee has generated well 
over Sl-5 million. Lei's see, if I am 
correct, there have been less than 75 
extra computers made available for 
open student access. 

Let me do some of my own 
math, Um , , I believe that one may 
purchase a new computer, wiih all 
the up-to-date systems and software, 
for about S2000 apiece. Now if we 
divide that into SI,5 milhon. we get 
about 750 new computers. What is 
thai? Money is needed to upgrade 
the processing system ai Computer 
Data and Processmg (CD &amp; P) so all 
ihese compuu;rs can run quickly- 
Okay - , . how about we only get 375 

V computers and CD &amp; P can lake 



5750,000 to upgrade. 

What is really happening is that 
all Ibe money is sitting somewhere 
in an account, getting miercsl for 
fulure university expenses while we 
walk furiously, searching for an 
open computer bay. I urge you, Mr 
Osborne, and all the other students 
of this university, to inquire of the 
univer^ily why there is a lack of 
computing facilities Also, please 
don't hold your fellow students in 
contempt for using the computers 
the way that they do. They were lold 
in the begmning that they could.

Students my age rarely con- 
sider that there is more to life than 
attending classes and going to 
Karoke bars. Yes, these things are 
common, and we do like lo do ihem 
repeatedly but there comes a time in 
everyone's college career when you 
want to do something new No one 
can ever be expected lo gain real 
I experiences on campus thai make 
you think and care about the lives or 
interests of other human bcmgs. 

Nothing, really, on campus interested me. Il costs 
miHiey to join a women's soronty, I needed to prove 
myself worthy lo become a pan of Christian Fellowship. 
All I warned lo be was to remain an individual. I have 
been here at IPFW for, lets just say, a long time and 
wanted to meet anyone inieresiing here. 1 resisted label- 
ing myself in order lo become a pan of tbe collective 
university Borg, 

Finally, I decided the only way in which I could 
share my personality and meet people was to volunteer 
in the Fon Wayne community It is true most people my 
age volunteer to gain references, and that's alright but 
the motives could have Ihe potential lo lessen the mean- 
ing of giving your energies to a cause. 

I volunteered a few places during tbe past few years. 



Fu^t. I cleaned monkey cages at the zoo and you can 
imagine the rest Bui at the zoo. ihey did give me a 
choice so I chose to press the buttons for the African 
Veldt dunng the drought of '88 

Despite the heat, I bad fun. You may have been on 
my route I was the girl who liked to jerk the cars around 
to simulate an electrical shortage. (Hey, 1 was only 15 
then. HaO 

I did noi volunteer again until I was a sophomore in 
college. I bad taken a science course at IPFW and I was 
inieresied in volunteering again, but by this time I had 
put the African Veldi out of my mind, besides I was 
studying education ai the imne 1 worked for the Girl 
Scouts dunng the winter and helped diero make "snow 
candles" outside and liked answering their questions 
about habitats of woodland animals. I was happy lo 
share my knowledge and had a blast leachmg. 

Through these experiences, I not only met people 
wbo shared the same mierests but leaned how to relate 
to people directly and work on a team. 

I am well aware that may students will think this 
would be too sappy or that the time would be better 
spent at bars. It really does noi take thai much time You 
usually can dictate how often you want lo volunteer. 
Some good places I have heard of are Science OntraJ, 
tbe Lincoln Museum . how about being an aduli mcnior 
for Big Brothers, Big Sisters?

eekend my 
younger brother 
s mamed He 
and his wjfc-io- 
be had asked me 
to speak at the 
ceremony, .i^ I hjJ had a hand in fix- 
ing iban up. I had a q^ponuniiy lo 
say pretty much whaiever I warned 
lo say, be it a poem or persona! 
memories. Anything. 

I had the oppominily lo say any- 
thing '"ptofpund'" to my brother (and 
a few hundred other people) (hat I 
wanted. For once in my life, I was 
both chokcd'up and lerrified. I cried 
before 1 stepped out in from of all of 
those people and I began crying 
again the moment that I left the 
podium 

Before you call me a sentimen- 
tal wuss or something. I'd like you 
10 know ihat [ didn't cry because I 



was afraid of public speaking, as 
I'm completely at home speaking in 
front of people. I didn'l cry because 
1 wasn't happy with what be was 
doing— I got them together, and. 
dammit, I was the proudest perM}n 
m ibe cbuTCb. And 1 didn'l cry 
because I don't love my brodier or 
anything even remotely close to 
that. 

I cried because 1 realii[Cd. for the 
first time m my life, how much I 
really loved my brother I have 
another younger brother. Ben, and I 
love ihe kid very much, but he's 
seven years younger than I am, 
whereas Tony and I are only 21 
months apart in age 

Tony and I have gone through 
everything in our hves together, but 
we've never really said whether we 
cared about each other. We just 
never took the time to .say anything. 

Not so very long ago he and I 
were practically enemies We tried 
10 ouido each other in every possible 
way, We were only two years apart 
in school, and many of bis friends 
have older siblings who are my 



friends. We both did well in school, 
but we did it in different ways — 1 
was the "smart" one. he was the 
"cool" one. We were alike in so 
many ways, but also opposite in 



Time passed, as it always 
inevitably docs, and I went away to 
West L^ayeite lo attend Purdue. I 
had a nice two years there — heck. I 
met my husband — but I realized 
thai

us We got into all kinds of trouble, imssing — my family 

stones that are still legendary in our My brothers were both growing 

family We were the omeriest of the up so fast and 1 was miles away, 

ornery. Truth be told, he was my missing all of the "big" moments of 

first best friend their teenage years that ibey bad 



waltzed through with me. Tony 
graduated from high schiHil while I 
was gone; Ben went clear through 
junior high I missed Tony's proms, 
parlies, dales, car accidents and 
SAT-jmers — all of those things that 
he helped me survive. Missing the 
moments that make those years so 
important bothered me, I missed my 
brothers more than I wanted to 
admit 

I imsscd our bickering. I missed 
their sometimes holier- than -ihou 
altitudes — but mostly. Ijusl missed 
ikem. So I came home. Okay, well, 
it wasn't back lo my parent's house, 
but to a place of my own — but it 
was still here, so I wouldn't miss 
anything ei.se. 

So now die years have passed, 
Tony's in college; Ben's a junior m 
high school. Me, well, I'm a senior 
in college and I've been mamed for 
almost two years. I think thai we're 
all turning out pretty good. We're all 
happy and well-adjusteii (way to go, 
Mom and Dad) 

Last Saturday, though, seeing 
my little brother lake wedding vows 



made me feel old suddenly, 1 heard 
that I made him cry when I spoke ai 
the wedding. I didn't mean to, but 
there were diings that I just had to 
say to him. He just looked so, well, 
so grown-up. He didn'l look tike 
thai little kid that I always think of 
when I think of him. He's some- 
body's husband now. So I cried. 

It took us a few years and a few 
bumps and bruises mflicied on each 
other, but we're friends again. He 
comes lo me and asks my opmions. 
He even takes my advice scmte- 
times. 

Now thai I've dned my posi- 
weddmg tears and reflect on Ihe 
past, I think that it was defmitely 
worth Ihe pain. So congraiulations, 
Tony and Holh I wish you Ihe best

Good behavior of students is buried under frigid surface 



what's week this w;eek: Dennis Doname 



Topping the LAME LIST this 
we«k, manners or should 1 say. the 
lack of. Does anybody say "thank 
you" anymore? I actually held the 
door for a student the other day and 
didn'l even gel eye contacL Is that 
. the way you were raised'' I hope noL 

I imagine this goes back to that 
whole altitude of "me first" A sim- 
ple "excuse me" seems almost polit- 
ically incorrect in these limes And 
there sure seem to be a lot of braily 
children these days 

For instance. I was driving 
down North Andiony last weekend, 
and three 10- or 12-year olds were 
cruising along on their BMX bikes 
down the miiklle of the road. I gave 
jusi a small little bonk, you know, to 
let them know I was coming along. 
Tbey spun their little heads around 
and flipped me off. Punks. I was so 



mad. 1 wondered if 1 could get them 
all with my door? (Later I thought it 
was kind of funny.) Who taught 
them this? The kids al school? Their 
parents? Where does a person learn 
how lo act? 

On days when we walk around. 
catatonic, heading towards class, do 
you step out of the way for pec^le? 
Or do you just bust on ihrougb, hit- 
ting people widi your book bags and 
your body'' When it is done to you, 
does It make you angry? 

I bear people say. "Man. people 
are so rude to me. why should I care 
how ihey want to be ueattd?" I 
don't know, maybe this is bow (be 
whole thing started. And you know 
what, it is so easy being polite 

Remember when somebody 
sneezed, we used (o always say 
"bless you," or that German word 1 
can't spell. Not anymore. People 



vcn acknowledge the fact 
anymore 

Here are some simple ways to 
get the ball rolling. Helping some- 
one pick up papers they dropped, no 
matter how cute they are. Thai 
would be pretty nice. 

Saying "please" can't be ihat 
hard can it? These simple lilUe 
things give everybody a chance to 
see how it works. 

Gomg around all day without 
concern for your fellow person is so 
tame . Start slow. 

Take baby sieps. Say "thanks," 
just once a day, to someone who 
does a kind deed. Then maybe you 
can see that being appreciated is 
cool. 

Have I gone soft? 

No. I'd slill like to strangle 
those little kids and a couple of odier 
people. For instance, you guys who 



hke. eat in cla.ss No biggie, 
OPEN THE FOOD PACKAGE 
BEFORE CLASS STARTS! you 
know you will be eating it dunng 
class, right'.' I'm pretty sure it won't 
spoil. Please spare mc the sound of 
plastic being ripped open and soda 
cans popping in the classroom, 

I'm sure if we keep this up. 
profs will notice and ban food alto- 
gether I wouldn't warn a few of you 
to spoil it for those of us ihai .mmd 
our manners. 



I can see it now, you'll all be sil- 
ting behind me in class next week 

with bags of Cool Ranch Doriios. 
Greal, now I'm bimgry. 

I'm not begging, just asking. 
Tone down die attitude and Iry to 
make this a better place If most of 
us do our pan, then Ihe rude ones 
will really stand out. The last points 
(Thank God) I just have lo mention. 
When you are in the halls after class. 
shut up! 

Turn It down just a tad will ya? 



Some of us could still be taking tests 
or trying to take notes. 

Lastly, slop slamming doors 
when you leave the classroom. I 
mean really, doesn't it txittier you? 
There is nothing like breaking up 
someone's concentration with a 
good old door slam. 

Take your tunc and practice 
being polite. Some of you need it. 
And for Pete's sake, turn off your 
stupid pagers' Where ihe .hell are 
your manners?

Welcome back to another

isually, my gang of idiots and I try 
1 pick out movies that cultivate a 
:nain theme, but sinet there is no 
leme this week, we've decided to 
ick out the coolest, manliest men in 
lovies. The men who we chose had

:iiain quality women succumb io 
( every movie. No chick ilicks or 
ssy boys are allowed on this list. 
hat leaves out Richard "Gerbil

ilmer U played by John Travolta as 

"collection agent" for a gangster 
ilmer loves the movies and some- 



how travels to Hollywood and

• Han Solo m the Star Wars trilogy. 
Hamson Ford turned Solo into the

woman just pours her bean to him 
and he plays it ever so cool and

• James Bond in the first five

cafeleria each day Chef Ray came 
10 IPFW this August from 
Huniingion College, where he also 
worked for Aramark. Prior lo his 
position ai Hunlington College. 
Chef Ray earned a degree in 
Culinary Ans from Ivy Tech and 
worked as a chef for five years al 
the Summii Club in downtown Fori 
Wayne. Chef Ray's training and 
cxpericna; cimlnbuie loward the 
quality, presentation and vaneiy of 
[be food served in ihe cafeteria 

Breakfast is served each day 
from 7:30 a.m. until 10 a.m. Piping 
hot biscuils and gravy are ladled up 
Each morning and a variety of bol 
breakfasi sandwiches are available 
Fresh muffins arc baked every 
morning Donuls, bagels, fresh 
fniit, cereal, milk, juice and coffee 
(approuniately four flavors every 
Jay) are also allraciively presented. 
Students who have 10 calch an early 
tnoming class and don't have lime 
10 hike over lo Walb can buy break- 
fast from ihe KeiUer HaJI food can, 
ivbicb opens ai 8 am in the base- 
neni of Keitler Hall each morning 

Luncb in the cafeieria offers 
nany choices with an "EasyGoes" 
leli line, a hot entree line, a gnll 
ine. hot soups, a salad bar. and the 
afeieria's popular pizzas. A week- 
y menu is available beside the cash 
egisiers. Whole fresh fruit, pack- 



aged snack foods, candy and bever- 
ages (Pepsi products) are also avail- 
able The cafetena serves lunch 
from 11 a.m. uniil 2 pjn., but 
remains open until 4 p.m each day 
(2 p.m. on Friday) Anything left 
from the grill or the "EasyGoes " 
line can be purchased until 4 p.m. 
The food can at Kcitler offers a 
modified lunch, salad and sandwich 
menu and operates uniil 2 p m. 

The "EasyGoes" deli line fea- 
tures fresh sandwiches, entree sal- 
ads, side salads and des.scns packed 
in "to go" containers Fresh tuna 
and chicken salads are prepared on 
tbe premises. The sandwiches and 
salads vary daily and feature spe- 
cialty breads and croissanLs, meats 
and cheeses. Low-tat dressings are 
available for the salads. All of the 
"EasyGoes" items are made fresh 
every day and are available unul 4 
pm. 

The hot entree hnc features two 
entrees each day, as well as pota- 
toes, pasta or rice and two vegeta- 
bles Once a week Chef Ray tries to 
serve a "center stage" item, which 
is an entree that is prepared to order, 
such as a stir fr&gt; or laco salad. Once 
again, almost everything served on 
the bol entree liie is homemade. 

The grill line prepares burgers, 
chicken breasts and other grilled 
meats on an electric flame-powered 
gnll (new to tbe kitchen this year), 
for a more authentic "grilled" laste 
Tbe gnll Une offers "combo" meals 
at pnces comparable to most fast- 
food restaurants, and as an added 
bonus, fresb leaf lettuce, tomato 
slices and deli-style dill pickle 
slices are available as a garnish. 
French fries, deep-fried fish and 
breaded chicken are also served on 
the grill line. A special sandwich, 
such as a foot-long or ham and 
cheese Monte Cristo is featured 




daily 



On 



or two hot soups are offered each 
day, which, Cbef Ray indicates, arc 
usually homemade. The hot soups 
sit beside a small salad bar, so salad 
or soup and a sandwich are more 
options for Ihe hungry diner. 

Last, but certainly not least, the 
cafetena assembles and bakes indi- 
vidual pizzas fresh every day 
According to Cbef Ray, the pizzas 
are the cafeteria's most popular 
food item, and he estimates they 
sell at least 50 pizzas cveiy day. 
Sausage and pepperoni are always 
available along with a specialty 
pi7.za each day. 

The cafeteria also has its own 
baker on the premises. Otis 
Spunkmeyer's specialty cookies are 
baked fresb every day, as are frost- 
ed cakes, brownies and pies. And 
the pieces are big! Rice Krispies 
treats arc another snacktime 
favorite coming out of the kitchen 

Tbe cafeleria offers sit down 
dining with china and cutlery or 
standard "to go" contamers and 
plaslicware Students and staff who 
choose to dine m can sit in one of 
two large dming ares, all non-smok- 
ing, or can cat outdoors on tbe 
patio Tbe larger dining room plays

Baltimore ai Washington 

The Ravens, with all the luck

pull a win off in the nation's capital. 
But then again, which Baltimore

Even the Super Etome can't hide 
the fact that the Saints have been

Tennessee at Arizona 

Zona, even with the Snake tak-

Carolina should take care of the

one winning design will be made into empty note cards suitable for all year round, if 
the participants would like to contribute the text inside as well, they are more than 
welcome. 

We are going to start out by printing 500 copies of each design. So start telling your 
friends and family of our up-coming fundraising project. We have decided to sell the 
cards in packages of 20 cards/ 20 envelopes for $10.00 per package. The proceeds 
will go toward the educational development scholarship.

Dirty Laundry: Tony "Kid" laux 



By Scott Warden 
Sports Reporter 

Wiih an unblemished 110 
record in the Grcai Lakes Valley 
ConfCTcncc and 23rd ranking in Ihc 
country. IPFW's women's volleyball 
team has proven liself lo be ai ibc 
very least a good team. 

This weekend, the Dorus will 
have an opportunity lo prove jusi 
bow good they are when they travel 

10 Wiiconsin-Parkside 
where they will face 
Michigan Tech , Lake 
Superior State and 
the top-ranked 
team in Division 

11 — ihe 
Northern 
Michigan 
Wildeau. 

Last sea- 
son IPFW 
fell to 
Northern 
Michigan in 
Ihrcc games i 
in the first 
round of ibe 
regional, bi]l 
this season. 

Coach Tun Heffron 
believes thai he's put logethi 
a team that can compete 
with the nation's best. 

"We've defi 
oitely assembled 
a team that — 
athletically — 
can compete 
with them." said 
Heffron 

"Whether or not all 
of our people are on and can play on 
that given day, we'll see this week- 
end But athletically. I feel very con- 
lidenl with the athleticism of our 
team compared to any other team in 
Division II." 

That athleticism has led to one 
3f the best seasons in IPFW history. 

At the beginning of the season, 
Heffron had set high expectations 
for this leam. and with its 21-2 
tcord. most would think that aloitc 
A&gt;ouId eclipse the coach's hopes. 

"So far I think we're on sched- 
ile." Heffron said 

"We'll have a belter record than 
asi year and are m a position to do 
letter overall than we did lasi sea- 
ion. More importantly, though, 
ve've improved as a team To what 



level we've improved has yet lo be 
seen." 

Though improvemeni was 
tJipeaed. it's also somewhat of a 
surprise considering of the eight 
positions (six starters and two back- 
cnun specialists), only one is Tilled 
by the same player as last year's 
squad. 

"All of the new people — both 
the freshman and transfers — have 
coniribuied immensely lo the suc- 
cess of this leam." Heffron said. 
"Andi Reichhart is the only per- 
spot as last year 
and the rest are all either new to 
Ihe program 
or new lo 
their 
position. 
so that's 
a preily 
radical 
change — 
more so than 
mosi people 
ihink," 

Tu an exicnt, the Dons will be 
able to quantify their improve- 
ment this weekend against 
the leam thai ended their 
season a year ago. 

"Although 
Northern Michigan is No. I 
the nation, when I look at 
their team thLs year and from what 
lear from oihet people, while 
they're very good, the dif- 
ference between the teams

try and gel Dave a career as
