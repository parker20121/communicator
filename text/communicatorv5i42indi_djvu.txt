Cane, Un-Party big winners in election 



The Un-Party swept to victory in 
the Student Body General Elections 
by a margin of roughly 70 votes, 
according to preliminary vote totals 
from the Election Board. Russell 
Cane was elected president and Pat 
Teagarden was named vice-president 
in voting held Tuesday and Wednes- 

The Un-Party, not running a full 
slate, won all of the Senate and 
Student Union Board positions con- 
tested. Pam Craig, Vicki Doster, 
Terry Kundysek, Rex Putt and Steve 
Beck won the uncontested Senate 
Seats for the ACT party. 

"I think that throughout the 
elections John Gerber and athe rest of 
the Election Board have exhibited a 
fairness, impartiality and integrity 
that should be commended. As far as 
the campaign is concerned, I still feel 



that the issues we supported were 
more realistic." said ACT presi- 
dential candidate Charles Pratt. "I 
think that our party ran a clean and 
honest campaign." 

When asked how he felt about 
losing Pratt said, "Terrific, just 
terrific." 

President-elect Cane expressed 
delight at being elected to the post. 
"For most people the year begins the 
last of August; for the Un-Party, it 
begins today." Cane also expressed 
his party's thanks to all of the 
students who voted for them in the 
election. 

Voter turnout was more than 
expected by most observers, as over 
1,000 students had voted by 4 p.m. on 
Wednesday, according to Election 
Board estimates. The turnout was 
significantly higher than last year's

Ruple, veterans 
attend hearing 



By TOMMY FRANKE 

Ward Ruple, director of the Office 
of Veteran's Affairs, along with 
several IU-PU veterans, is traveling 
to Bloomington today to attend a 
hearing to assess the needs of the 
Vietnam veteran. 

The hearing, which is sponsored 
by the United States Senate, is one of 
many being held throughout the 
country. 

Indiana Senator Vance Hartke is 
sponsoring a bill in the House that 
concerns the Vietnam veteran and 
benefits he should receive. 

The bill, named the Vietnam Era 
Veterans Readjustment Assistance 
Act of 1973, was called "an excellent 
piece of legislation" by Ruple. 

Ruple is making a recommenda- 
tion to Hartke at the hearing 
regarding the bill. In the bill, the 
Vietnam veterans eligibility to 
receive educational benefits after he 
completes active duty is limited to ten 
years, an increase from eight years 
which is presently enforced, Ruple 
believes this delimiting restriction 
should be lifted completely. 

Ruple also said in his recommen- 
dation to Hartke that he thinks that 
of opinion of the 



i this campus i

Vietnam veteran should i 
many benefits as the World War II 
veteran. Hartke's bill does provide for 
this parity, 

Hartke's bill provides a 23 
percent increase in educational 
benefits over what is being received 
now. However, Ruple thinks that the 
veteran's benefits should follow an 
escalating scale parallel to the rise in 
the cost of living. 



Tomorrow is the last day that entries may be 
deposited In the Communicator boxes for the 
New Course Contest that this newspaper is 
sponsoring, 

Anyone who has an idea or ideas may submit 
one idea per entry. Each entry must be 
typewritten and not more than 50 words long. 

A panel consisting of one student and two 
faculty members will judge the ideas. 

A $25 prize will be awarded for first place, 
and five 510 second prizes will be offered, 

Boxes are located beside the Communicator 
stands for the entries. All entries must be in 
before 5 p.m. 

All course ideas will be forwarded to faculty 
members for possible consideration. 



;ional benefits. 
Since others are trying to get 
legislation passed that asks for 
smaller increases, it will probably 
result in some political caucusing. 



He added. "I think that Hartke is 
making a real effort." 

In Ruple's recommendation, he 
said, "The humane, the magnani- 
mous the honorab le gesture would be 
for the elected representatives of the 
people to give the Vietnam veteran 
what he deserves..."

AM: 



This time, APO NEEDS help 

Alpha Phi Omega Fraternity looks like it is next in the line of worthy 
IU-PU programs, organizations, and services that are phasing out of 
existence, and its death pattern is the same as many of the others! 

Its claim to fame at IU-PU has been the book exchange it operates at 
the beginning of each semester- The exchange enables students to sell 
their used books in an organized manner and for more money than is 
offered by the campus bookstore. 

Another project that deserves special note is the "Screw of the Year" 
award that the fraternity gives to (un)deserving faculty each year. 
Students must pay a penny for each vote they cast in the mock election, 
and the money goes to some needy child. 

If APO dies, IU-PU will lose more than a group of do-gooders. It will 
lose the book exchange, on-campus blood drives, and the chance to 
participate in community-wide service projects. It goes without 
mentioning what needy little girls, among others, will lose. 

All APO needs to exist is a little support from a very small number of 
students. A handful of students who wish to donate a little time to service 
for others can find a ready means of doing so with APO. 

Maybe some of those people who are big on rhetoric about everyone 
having an obligation to the underprivileged can put those words to action 
through APO. At least the sincere ones can. 

If you are genuinely sincere about this, let APO help you help the 
underprivileged. 

A CHANGING WORLD 



By AUDREY GELLIS 

Feminist charges that National 
Me" campaign was 
designed to sell more than air space 
has produced a rash of wild rumors 
that should be put to rest. 

It is absolutely untrue that 
National is thinking or changing its 
name to Topless Airlines. Or that 
beaded curtains are being installed in 
the tails of their 747's. Furthermore, 
the whispers that the airline is being 
investigated for possible violations of 
the Mann Act were started by a bunch 
of disgruntled stewardesses too 
plump to fit into hot pants. 

Actually, National's merchandis- 
ing of stewardesses is in the grand old 
tradition of airline advertising, most 
of which reads like the copywriters 
trained with Xavier Hollander. Even 
the staid and proper British advertis- 
ed their nag carrier BOAC with 
full-page illustrations of Elizabethan 
serving wenches cavorting on revel- 
ers laps. The accompanying headline 
read "When we started training our 
cabin crews, the aeroplane wasn't 
invented." 

However, it's little Air Jamaica's 
advertising that flies the highest. 
That line may not have Cheryl and 
her friends, but they have "rare 
tropical birds representing the best of 



" modeling bikinis in 
mid-air fashion shows. The tired 
businessman may be disappointed if 
he doesn't encounter some turbulence 
since the airline promises a trip he'll 
never forget with a message 
borrowed from massage parlors "We 
make you feel good all over. " 

Slightly subtler are pitches like 
United Airlines plea to "Take along 
a little inspiration" (the wife, of 
course!) and the Lufthansa Red 
Baron's broad hint at red lights. 

Just about the only major airline 
to refrain completely from flesh 
peddling is Icelandic (think what they 
could do with "Warm up those 
freezing Arctic nights"). Their 
business is booming even though all 
they advertise are the lowest 
trans-Atlantic fares of any scheduled

Be able to take it with patience. 
Always be kindly. Never be jealous or

Corinthians 13:4. 



As evidence piles up that cocaine 
is a growing menace, particularly 
among those who can afford such 
"champagne" (or as known on the 
street-coke, snow, gold dust, bernice, 
rich man's drug, pimp's drug), 
questions arise as to its origin and 



There is general agreement that 
the principal source is South 
America, particularly Ecuador, 
Peru. Bolivia and Colombia. Miss 
Pednny Lernoux, Copley News 
Service correspondent in South 
America, wrote a few days ago that 
the flow of cocaine is practically wide 
open, mostly due to U.S. preoccupa- 
tion with heroin and marijuana. She 
also indicates that from the view of 
people well south of the border, U.S. 
authorities aren't doing much about 
the cocaine problem. 

Baird agrees with this view. "It's 
old hat," he said. "We've been telling 
the Bureau of Narcotics and Danger- 
ous Drugs about it for 20 years, but 
they don't listen-they need a real 
education. It has been part of the drug 
addict world since 1948 and has come 
to the forefront as the fools in states 
like New York and California fight to 
lower the penalties for use of 
marijuana and other narcotics. 

"Today, in Mexico cocaine is a 
big thing at fancy political parties-an 
after-dinner sniff of cocaine to get 
high-they think it is a 'safe' 
high, which it isn't." Drs. Smith and 
Wesson point out in their book why 
cocaine is a high middle-class 
product. It is the cost-from $500 to 



$1500 an ounce and §50 a gram from 
street sellers. There is a certain 
amount of what the drug world calls 
"ated with taking 



Even though the cost is high and 
the well-to-do users may think the 
cocaine they are snorting is OK, there 
is no Food and Drug Administration

End to ROTC start on path away from militarism 



for 



By JEFF GIBSON 

Many readers of the Communica- 
tor know that a Reserve Officers 
Training Corps program is offered to 
students of IU-PU through the ROTC 
unit at Indiana Institute of Techno- 
logy I have serious specific reserva- 
tions about the marriage of ROTC and 
college campuses as well as disagree- 
ments in general about the whole set 
of assumptions underlying ROTC. 
With the continued adverti 
ROTC in the Communicator I think 
is time to reveal what's going on 
behind the scenes with ROTC here at 
IU-PU 

ROTC is offered to any qualified 
sludenl of IU-PU as a possible 
educational alternative What is not 
reported to students in general is that 
ROTC courses are available at $8 per 



who teach ROTC 
compensated for their work by the 
university. Yet there are many 
courses on the IU-PU campus, such as 
directed reading, directed writing, 
independent research, thesis re- 
search, for which instructors receive 
no compensation either. Such select- 
e tuition policy is openly dis 



I see three alternatives to ending 
tuition discrimination: 

--All the above-mentioned courses 
should have a tuition reduction equal 



to thai of the ROTC courses. 

-All ROTC courses should have a 
raise in tuition to make them 
equivalent in dollars per credit hour 
to the normal IU-PU tuition rates. 

-Or, all ROTC courses available 
through the university should be 



would like to draw i 
consequences of conlinued ROTC in 
education. Because ROTC is taught 
by Army personnel the administra- 
tion of IU-PU has no control over the 
selection of ROTC faculty or the 
standards for an instructor's qualifi- 
cations. According to information 
from the ROTC program of the 
Fellowship of Reconciliation ROTC 



ily q

not be The officer in charge must 
have a baccalaureate degree or be 
working toward one. The require- 
ments do not state how far along in his 
undergraduate work he must be. The 
non-commissioned officer must have 
only a high school diploma. Also 
under ROTC the university has no 
control over course content or the 
selection of texts. And since ROTC 
instructors are not compensated by 
the university for classes taught the 
whole ROTC program has no 
responsibility to the university. 

One justification for allowing 
ROTC through the IU-PU campus is 
that educational institutions exist to 
give students a free and open choice 
as to what courses of instruction they 
wish to pursue. The university makes 



no judgement upon the validity or 
appropriateness of the course. Seem- 
ingly, then, any moral or ethical 
consequences inherent in such a 
e become the student's responsi- 



bility when 



selection 



only to offer open choices to students 
without comment on the course's 
propriety, then, in a consistent 
application of logic, the university 
should have no qualms about offering 
courses in training in something like 
the Red Guard. The very fact of 
offering some courses rather than 
others often implies a judgement on 
the part of the university that some 
classes are more important than 
others But what becomes of the 
student's right to choice? (Limiting 
courses may imply that the university 
does not have the facilities to teach a 
given course. Yet IU-PU has no ROTC 
facilities, but it still offers the 
program. If the university's concern 



is with a student's right to choose, 
why couldn't a similar arrangement 
be made for other courses? ) 

Certainly, nothing should be done 
intentionally to make the taking of 
any given course more advantageous 
than others. But, however uninten- 
tional, the low cost of ROTC does 
precisely this. The number of courses 
offered in a given area of study and 
the degree or degrees a student may 
obtain by taking those ( 
makes one choice n 
than others. Are there i 
Non-Violence and Peace Studies 
equivalent in number and advantage 
to those offered through ROTC? How, 
under the above assumption about the 
purpose of educational institutions, 
does the university insure that 
students have the opportunity to hear 
orientations and interpretations 
which differ from the military so that 
a free and open choice really is 
possible? 

I do not believe that education is 
morally or politically neutral. The 



tL Mim 



ROTC at IU-PU 



university, even in choosing not to 
make judgements on the value of 
courses, demonstrates that detach- 
ment is a commendable attitude. In 
making ROTC available the univer- 
sity, to some degree, implicitly 
supports the goals of this type of 
military education. Certain questions, 
then, fundamental to the nature of 
education at IU-PU need to be asked. 

-How does IU-PU plan to adhere 
to its principles of local control of 
curriculum and personal policies, if 
the text books used in ROTC are 
prepared by the military, the course 
of study is prescribed by the military, 
and instructors are ultimately res- 
ponsible for their conduct only to their 
superior officer? 

-In terms of military career 
education, what teaching techniques 
and content do military personnel 
have to offer that your certified 
teachers do not have the competence 

-Will the right to dissent and 
freedom of inquiry, essential ingredi- 
ents of education in a democracy, be 
respected or will there be indoctrina- 



defined by the military appropriate 
for a civilian society in a democracy 
(especially in the light of Watergate)? 



e of a democratic form of 
government? Do officers trained in 
the military understand the differ- 



Education can no longer afford to 
be responsible only to itself. It must 
speak to the concerns of the world 
around it. The philosopher and 
educator Alfred North Whitehead 
stated, "Celibacy does not suit a 
university. It must mate itself with 
action. ' ' Education has remained 
celibate too long. It has failed to 
question persons and institutions 
which need questioning. It has failed 
to confront problems which need 
confronting. 

A great issue (perhaps the 
greatest) which we face today is the 
depth of militarism in our lives. It 
shapes our attitudes, molds our 
relationships, determines our sense of: 
morality, and blinds us to other, more 
fundamental sources of security. And 
never has the problem of militarism; 
been so great. As an advertisement- 
for Religion in American Life 
succinctly put it, "Remember when 
only God could end the world?" 

Unless the unversities (which I 
see as testing grounds for new 
alternatives) can create paths away 
from old and increasing dependen- 
i ways of getting connected 



human differences that we seek to 
find an identify by turning homes, 
cities and nation into fortresses. 

Saying "No" to ROTC on this 
campus would be a good start in the 
path away from militarism. Saying

WLYV every night between LO p.m. and 2

Martin is on the air during those hours. 

Another fan named Mary, who said she 
is an Indiana-Purdue freshman, wanted to 
arrange an aller-hours rendezvous with the

at 2 a.m. in the building's lobby. 

Others call to request their favorite 
country songs; still others call to find out 
when Martin is going to play the Super 
Hi-Lo money give-away game. 

In fact, Mai tm spends most of his four

On the Way Out 



By ANN OXLEY 

MAKREAS ONE 

Mary Makreas went away during spring break. Far 
away to Washington, D.C. to attend a Congressional 
Seminar. Along for the Washington Workshops were high 
school and college students from twenty-five states. 

Mary Ellen, having been introduced to our younger 
senator from Indiana in his Senate office, was invited by 
Birch Bayh to accompany him to the Senate Chambers. It 
was a heady experience to stride along at a senator's side. 
Several blocks pounded away in what seemed several 
seconds. But thrill time wasn't over yet for our 1U-PU 
political science freshman. On the steps of the Capitol, 
Indiana's affable Birch was recognized by tourists who 
wanted a snapshot on that stereotyped set of stairs. Senator 
Bayh obliged, introducing his diminutive dark-haired young 
friend as, "This is Mary Ellen, from back home." The 
ever-present little old lady type sidled up next to Mary 
during the snapping and said, "Are you the senator's wife. 
my dear?" Receiving a dazed negative, she continued with 
acute observation, "Well you look just like her." 

Another especially memorable moment occurred when 
Mary Ellen recognized Senator Thomas Eaglelon. She had 
nothing available to do in i his .mto^raph on. save a clipping 
she had hastily torn from the morning edition of The 
Washington Post. Senator Eagleton smilingly obliged, 
noting the the profferred newspring looked like "the death 
notices." "It's the Schedule of Congressional Action for 
Today, Senator." With a wry smile, Senator Eagleton 
reiterated, "That's what I said, 'death notices.' " 



Pagony Makreas went further away during vac; 
She flew out to the west coast and San Francisco.

song, but also the date line on a story that has been hogging 
head lines for several months now, the Hearst kidnapping. 
Incredible as it seems, Pagony was on site at the time of one 
of the latest developments in that story. It was her aunt, 
Mrs. Kallip Volikakis, among other kin, that Pagony went 
avisiting, and it was at Mrs. Volikakis's shop that the dozen 
red roses were ordered with the message for the Hearsts 
inserted. (This was the "She will be reused" note which 
preceded Patricia's taped intention to remain with the 
Symbionese Liberation Army.) The little florist shop was 
swarming with cameras, reporters, and FBI. Pagony said 
her aunt strove valiantly to answer questions with a not 
quite voluble English vocabulary, leading to a description 
of a "pretty lady with a dress with two pieces" who placed 
the rose order. 

The family gained instant fame in the area due to 
saturation media coverage. Another relative of that name,

PLASTIC ORPHANS 

Did you forget something? Between the dark side of 
Neff hall and the daylight side of the Union is a magnificent 
structure which houses many volumes of quaint and 
sometimes impressive lore. It also holds and cares for 
nearly a thousand orphans. Do you remember now? Your 
library card-that you forgot to pick up. Of course, there are 
others in the same deprived category. But show quality! 
Claim your own! 

Roger Miller, assistant librarian, states that once 
you've gotten that plastic rectangle punched out in your 
name and in your possession, you have full rights and. 
library privileges for your career at IU-PU. You never have: 
to fill out another blank or replace a tattered piece of 1

you entitled to a fine research center on Sunday night?

PRO BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS 

"If there was to be a designated favorite (in the NBA 
playoffs), it would probably have to be the Milwaukee 

"Beware of the Celtics." 

"A healthy Knick team will again be hard to beat." 
"Buffalo will probably have to wait another year." 
"The absences ot Wilt Chamberlain, Jim McMillan and 
the limited play of injury-ridden Jerry West have changed 
LA from a super team to a mediocre team." 

These quotes are a few of the comments I made in my 
earlier prognostication on the NBA playoffs. I also said that 
the Bulls and Pistons were about even. Chicago beat the 



Milwaukee, Boston, New York, and Chicago. The Bulls and 
Bucks will be battling it out for the Western title, while the 
Knicks and Celtics will again and again and again compete 
for the Eastern championship. The winners will vie for the 
NBA championship. The New York Knicks are the 
defending champions. 

Capital actually gave the Knicks a much stronger run 
than I thought they would. The unexpected strength for the 
Bullets was the impressive play of past MVP Wes Unseld. 
He had been immobilized most of the year with knee 
problems, but against New York he looked agile as well as 
devastating as he continuously drove for the basket. And as 
was evident no one on the opposition was stupid enough to 
step in front of a driving Wes Unseld. Phil Chenier and the 
Big E both looked excellent, as the Bullets nearly upset the 
Knicks, before finally bowing out in the final game of the 

Cool Walt Frazier was highly responsible for the Knicks 
Coming out on top. In the fifth game of the series 
Frazier dropped in 38 points, including 16 in the final 
quarter, as the Knicks edged the Bullets by two points in one 
of the finest Pro games 1 have ever seen on TV. That win 
gave the Knicks a 3 game to 2 edge, and they went on to take 
the series four games to three. 

Milwaukee is awesome, so they made the Lakers look 
as bad as they really are. Jabbar is still the most dominant 
player in the league, but the Bucks couldn't win without the 
hustling defense and teamwork of the other players. 

The Bulls, who had a very difficult time getting past 
Detroit, will have to play their best to defeat the tough 
Bucks. I'll put a Buck on Milwaukee in this matchup. 

The Celtics disposed of a very stubborn Buffalo, who 
surely will be back next year despite several high scoring 
games by McAdoo, the leading NBA scorer. The Celtics 
used experienced to defeat the young Buffalo squad. 

Havlicek is healthy for the series with New York, so the 
Knicks really have something to worry about this year. 
Boston has an explosive offense, and as was obvious to 
television viewers Sunday afternoon, John Havlicek is its 
leader. The Knick defense must be much tougher in order to 
defeat the Celtics for the third year in a row. 

I say that Boston will defeat New York, but even though 
the first game was easy for the Celtics, I think it will still 
take the full seven games. 

Milwaukee and Boston will be in the championship 
clash, and I think Boston will be ready for the favorite 
Bucks. Jabbar will perform satisfactorily, but the other 
four members of the Milwaukee f iv e will have some trouble 
with the sticky Celtic defense. 

Boston has the seasoned veterans to get the job done. 

Boston in seven. 

INDIANA-PURDUE ATHLETICS 

Indiana-Purdue at Fort Wayne is growing rapidly in all 
areas. The athletic program at IU-PU is no exception, but 
are there people trying to expand it to unnecessary and 
unreaslistic heights? 

The 1973-4 Mastodon basketball team was gifted with a 
nice progressive schedule; one that gave them very good 
competition. The following example indicates the typical 
characteristics of the well planned schedule, which was 
probably made up in the cafeteria. 

On the second day of the second semester the team took 
off for Southern Illinois to play Southern Dlinois-Edwards- 
ville (a team that had the NIT champs, Purdue University, 
on their schedule). The Mastodons got slaughtered and 
missed two days of classes. But that isn't the extent of my 
example, because two days later they took off for Jeffer- 

sonville, Indiana to play an afternoon game at 
Jeffersonville. The game was played at 8:00 p.m. and the 
team got back to Fort Wayne in the middle of the night. 
They lost that game, too. 

Early in the season they played four games in one week. 
Later in the season they averaged about one game per 

Meanwhile the golf team goes down to Florida to 
place twelfth in a tournament with a field of thirteen. Their 
competition (like that of many teams playing the Mastodon 
basketball team) was far superior, as the Mastodons 
weren't even close to the majority of the field. 

Many of the Mastodon athletic teams are good, but none 
of them should be facing competition like the University of 
Florida and the University of Southern Illinois. 

One anonymous source seriously questioned the 
purpose of the Southern excursion by the golf and baseball 
teams. The expenses used in this trip could very well be 
used for the development of Indiana-Purdue's facilities. 
The tennis tarn needs tennis courts much worse than the 
athletic director needs a sun tan.
