Purdue Adopts Credit Card Plan 



Purdue University has become 
the fir^t state institution of hieh- 
er learning to install a coUege-by- 
credil-card system for paying 
tuition and fees. Gregg 0. Leh- 
man, bursar on the Purdue Fort 
Wayne Campus, said that the new 
credit program heeoraea effective 
immediately and all students re- 
gistering for the spring semester 
irill be eligible to use either their 
Bank-Araericard or Master Charge 
Interbank Card. 

Officials in Purdue's Business 
Office here noted lliat the credit 
card program was instaUed locally 
througli the assistance of the Lin- 
coln National Bank and Trust 



Company and Peoples Trust Bank. 

Tfie new program marks a de- 
parture from the eash-on-lhe-line 
procedure ivhich was required 
for the payment of all fees for 
many years. Purdue officials had 
become increasingly aware of the 
difficulty some students were 
having in paying cash lo cover 
tuition charges and that because 
of this some students might be 
carrying fewer credit hours. 

An example of how the coUege- 
by-c red it-card plan works is this; 
The cost per credit hour at Purdue 
today (for an Indiana resident) 
is S20. Thus, a student carrying 
10 hours could borrow §200 on 



Winter Carnival 
Events Announced 



Indiana and Purdue students on 
the Fort Wayne Campus will have 
a weekend of frolicking on Friday 
and Saturday, February 6-7 dur- 
ing the second annual Winter 
Carnival. 

All events during the two days 
are open not only to I.U. and 
Purdue students but to Fort 
Wayne and area students repre- 
senting other colleges and univer- 

The weekend will be launched 
irilh a Snow-Bound Party from 
9-12 midnight, Friday, February 
6, in the Student Lounge. The 



enlcrtainracnl will consist of five 
folk and jazz groups who will 
pejform in a ski lodge atmosphere. 

One of the highlights will be 
the coronation of the Winter Car- 
nival Queen at 10 p.m. Numerous 
prices will be awarded to the 
Queen including S25 gifts lo both 
the winning contestant and to 
the sponsoring organization. 

On Saturday, February 7, llie 
traditional Winter Olympics mil 
be run off from 12 noon lo 4 p.m.

the rate of SIO per month. 

It was poinlcd out that all stu- 
dents not already possessing 
either of these two credit card 
plans could establish a credit lini^

of Ihe 



money lo be borrowed would be 
determined by the actual amount 
necessary to cover tuition and fees 
and the ability of the individual 
lo repay his account. 

It is reported that the pro- 
gram is popular with parents who 
have discovered a groiving sc 
city of cash because of the p 
sent-day inflationary economy.

Senate Meeting 



Comniunicator Gets 
Money For Two Issues 



The January 22nd Student Sen- 
e Meeting involved the 1970 
Spring Semester Budget for the 
lU-PU COMMUNICATOR. Dis- 
the subject was quite 
lengthy and involved all details 
the past budget besides tlie 
' budget. It was stated a con- 
lion could not be reached for 
the allocation of money to the 
newspaper for a couple of weeks 
id the discussion was ended. 
The next item on the agenda 
concerned Community Relations 
hich is headed by Don Sluckey. 
Various ideas and suggestions 
were discussed among die sena- 
tors but DO definite 
were made. Mr. Sluckey will 



tinue lo work on these ideas so 
lliat Fort Wayne organizations 
may profit from the use of the 
Regional Campus facilities. 

Mark Souder then introduced a 
resolution slating: "We feel any 
individual or group representing 
an organization which has re- 
ceived any student activity money 
and who runs his organization in- 
to debt shall be liable for the 
amount overspent." The idea- of 
this resoution is to stop over- 
spending. Questions on the legal- 
ity of this resolution and its word- 
ing ivere voiced and John Ainlay 
offered to have it checked out. 
Further action was postponed.

Editorial 

Keep It Clean 

by Roxanne Bruna 

Judeement day has come. What you see here is exhibit 
A and E — our infamouB student lounge in its two ex- 
tremes. Unfortunately the more unpleasant of these ex- 
tremes is the one that prevails the majority of the time. 
After looking at these two settings, what's your verdict? 
Now don't laugh; it's not to be laughed at. But then, maybe 
you like lounging in asanctum of glittering cigarette ashes, 
crumpled food wrappers, cigarette butts, extinguished 
matches, and other various and sundry items. Perhaps, to 
you, the student lounge and all of its disorderly surroundings 
adds just that necessary touch of "home." 

The janitorial staff obviously is the party which bears 
the brunt of the situation. Even their valiant attempt to 
clean the lounge every three hours seems to make little dif- 
ference when the filth almost immediately reappears like 
dandelions after a rainstorm. It has come to the point where 
janitors see students as a horde of rkving maniacs, con- 
tinuously with food — a practice which is supposedly pro- 
hibited. Whatever the rule, the practice is to throw trash 
wherever it is most convenient. Whether the litter makes 
it into one of the numerous trash cans is unimpoi-tant. 

As a result of our piggish habits, we are the victims 
of much criticism. In the November 12 issue of the Jourwil 
Gazette, Dell Ford made a statement to the effect that our 
student lounge had the appearance of a pigpen. Does it 
take an outsider to bring it to our attention? 

So far all of these items has little consequence to you, 
the student. However, the next point will undoubtedly arouse 
your concern. If we continue our slovenly habits, the student 
lounge may very well be taken away from us. Yes that 
means CLOSED. So take some advice. Either improve your 
aim at the trash cans and ashtrays or refrain altogether 
from eating and smoking in the lounge.

True Equality 

by Mark Souder, Stiideiii Body President 

Several months ago. Student Senator Don Stuckey 
aroused the feminine population to great indignation when 
he authored a column concerning women assuming their 
pix&gt;per place in today's society. His critics, claiming to 
speak for their sex, demanded equality for the women of 
the world. 

Most of us guys in Student Government prefer our 
friends from the opposite sex to at least resemble a lady 
and not the Los Angeles Rams Fearsome Foursome. Many 
of us feel certain attempts by females to enter professional 
athletics via the courts are ludicrous. There are certain tra- 
ditional values which prohibit the integration of locker 

However, if the girls at this campus really desire to 
attempt to compete on equal terms, we'll play too. A Student 
Government committee supporting the Student Body Vice- 
President, John Ainlay, for Mid-Winter Carnival Queen 
has been formed. 

To be perfectly honest girls, you don't have a chance. 
John "Pinkj'" Ainlay may very well be unbeatable. What 
girl, assuming she will drop her traditional prejudices 
about queens, can resist Pinky's long eyelashes, beautiful 
physique, and hairy legs. While most normal guys could 
probably resist those attributes, they will admire his de- 
termination, commonness, and willingness to carry the 
banner for manhood. 



recent issue of your paper 
you presented a table of coals 
of "A" and "B" sticker parking 
places at 3 local campuses. This 
is indeed interesting, but is pre- 
sently of little value or relevance 
lo students at Fort Wayne Region- 
al. Since I was a student at Pur- 
due University Campus for 3*A 
years, I know who buys A and 
B permits. Tlicy are: 1) well-to-do 
students who would rather pay 
S60.00 to park 1 block from a 
building rather than be incon- 
venienced and have to walk 2 
blocks (or more), 21 faculty and 
cradualeg. and 3) administrators. 
Tlie important point is that you 
don't HAVE to have an A or B 
sticker tn get to your classes, you 
can walk. For commuters, and 
there are a few, a special sticker 
is given. This allows ihcm to 
park closer to campus ond also 
Siiarantees them a spot, although 
not the same space each time. It 
would be more informative to 
find out what COMMUTERS have 
to pay lo park than to use A and 
B slicker costs. 

1 am sure that parking space 
will have to be paid for by the 
students, but not §60.00 a year! 
Since we are almost all com- 
muters, we need a space to park. 
I feel that free stalls would be 
welcomed by the students. This 
parking lot could be constructed 
farther from the main building 
with limestone or a similar mater- 
ial that would be cheaper than 
asphalt. Students who wished so. 
could keen their money and out 
out a litde more leg work. The 
walk could do no one in good 
health any harm. This lot could 
be located anywhere from one 
mile or less from the main build- 
ing — as ore dorms on most 
campuses.

Dear Editor: 

Hats off lo the fine lady who 
cleans tables in the cafeteria. 
Widiout her sincere effort to do 
a good job, we would be up to 
our armpils in trash. It is indeed 

bably gelling modest pay for 
•iuch a boring, ungrateful iob, 
put in so much enthusiasm. 

P.S. Some students could really 
help her and other students it 
they would simply deposit their 
trash in the numerous containers 
nrovided. I hope that as they

(hey don't continue such piggish,

Methodist Minister 
Has Unique Job 
At I.U.-P.U. 




Winter Carnival Queen 




Above, Mr, Mollo is shown lolk- 
ing with sludenls— a major port 
of his job. 

by Skeryl Smith 

Dai) Motto, a United Methodist 
minister, blends in well with the 
general confusion on the lU-PU 
Regional Campus. He's not a stu- 
dent or a faculty member but a 
minister involved in Exploratory 
Ministry, His position with the 
University is unofficial and he 
considers himself mainly as a 
"friend to the University." 

Mr. Motto obtained his B.A. 
from Indiana Central in 1962, 
his Bachelor of Divinity Degree 
from the Christian Theolo^eal 
Seminary in Boston, in 1966, and 
did his postgroduale work at the 
University School of Theology. 
He was the campus minister at 
Kansas Stale University for a 
year and had a parish in Tocsin, 
Indiana, for a year ond a half 
before coming here in December. 



There are mony aspects to Mr. 
Motto's job as an Exploratory 
Minister. One aspect is to be avail- 
able to student and faculty mem- 
bers if they have problems or if 
they just want to talk to some- 
one. His method of approach is 
one of a friend willing to listen 
and talk but he is by no means 
"pushy" in his approach. ITie talks 
are very informal and are usually 
about the student's everyday hang- 
ups. The talks may start out as an 

and may lead to more profound 
and deep discussions. 

Anotlier aspect of Mr. Motto's 
job ia to be of service to the Uni- 
versity. In bis position he can 
reach out to the community for 
support of the school's develop- 
ment and push tliem to action 
from an unbiased position. 

Mr. Motto is also used as a 
source for finding out what is 
available for college-age students 
in Fort Wayne and what they 
need. Organizations, particularly 
churches, use his first hand infor- 
mation in setting up seminars, dis- 
cussion groups, and other activi- 
ties that will appeal to collcec stu- 
denLQ. He also does outside speak- 
ing at local churches diacusainp 
ideas with them on how to make 
ilieir youth progr-ims more rele- 
vant to the students. 

Tlie program of Exploratory 
Ministry thot Mr. Motto is in- 
volved in has only recently come 
to tlic computer campuses. The 
first program in Indiana started 
on the Calumet campus of lU-PU. 
Occasionally there have been 
times when local churches have 
sent tlieir associate ministers to

the Regional Campuses to be 
available to the students, but 
these have not been very success- 
ful because of a lack of time on 
the part of the minister. Because 
of this, the United Methodist 
Church of the Fort Wayne Dis- 
trict decided to make their Explor- 
atory Ministry program full-time. 

Mr. Mollo, ivhcn asked bis ap- 
proach to the students, said, "I 
do not go out with my main pur- 
pose being to proselytize or con- 
vert everyone I meet to Metho- 
dism or Christianity. I operate 
completely ecumenically and my 
counseling develops from trust 
and not from my association irith 
one particular church or another." 

The position that Mr. Motto 
holds and the services that he 
renders on this campus are totoUy 
unique. He is available at almost 
any time and can be reached by 
calling 7'IS-0S88 or by writing
