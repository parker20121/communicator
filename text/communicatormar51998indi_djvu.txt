Indonesia: 



Financial crisis affects 
local students, companies 



By Docme Miller 
Chief Reporter 



This is Part Two of our special report on 
Indonesia. 

Local Effects 

The Indonesian Depression continues to have dev- 
astating effects. Native Indonesians have begun 10 
blame Chinese -Indonesians for the problems the coun- 
try is currently having. 

The properly of Chinese- Indonesians has been 
bumed or otherwise destroyed in the midst of recent 
noting 

In short, according to one Indonesian IPFW student, 
"ll is very bad [the conditions)." 

The studenu who does not wish to be identified, 
feels that be has good reason 10 be worried. He fears 
possible repercussions to his family or himself by 
speaking. 

His parents are still in Indonesia, attempting to 
cope. 

The student is also worried about bis parents 
because, although they tell bun that they are okay, they 
can no longer support him financially 

This will change his lifestyle dramaucally because 
he normally asks his parents for money He cannot work 
in the United Stales yet because be does not have a 
work permit. 

He also assumes that bis parents will have 10 start 
their business over when the country begins to recover. 

The Image most Americans think of when they 
envision a student who is able to obtain an education 
abroad is that of someone who is wealthy. 

.However, one Chinese -Indonesian student asserts 
that wealth is relative. 

"You have to understand that being upper-class in 
Indonesia is like a middle-class American." he said. 

Sixty percent of the Indonesian population is rural. 
Prior to the depression, some rural residenLs did not 
have electricity; now, some are not able to buy oil for 
cooking. 

Long lines form in some areas to receive rice, which 
Is a staple food for the region. 

Gerald Houseman, professor of political science, 
notes that, fortunately, there is not much starvation. 

Indonesians are also frustrated with the fluctuating 
money value. For example, one American dollar, which 
was formerly worth approximately 2,000 rupiah, is now 
worth between 7.000 and 15,000 rupiah 

Costs of everyday supplies and items have tripled. 



has a Planet Hollywood, big malls and dance clubs 
(called "'discotheques"). 

However. "They don't play disco music," the stu- 
dent says 

The clubs also do not have age limits. One student 
interviewed remembers going to a club when he was 
eleven years old and being served a beer 

The student says that getting drunk is not a typical 
part of the Indonesian culture. He finds it laughable thai 
so many Americans find pleasure in drinking. 

"I think only the young people in my country drink 
Here, even grandpa drinks a loL" he observes. 

Houseman attests to the relative "niceness" of 
Indonesia. 

"It is a ix-iH.it nut country with friendly people." he 
says. "We could learn from them. They are taught to he 
nice and n on ■confrontational, and to smde. which 
makes it a nice place " 

Another testament to the moral features of 
Indonesia is its style of dating and socializing. 

Group dales and arranged marriages arc common, 
says Houseman. There is not much dating 

"It is non- westernized Asia." says Houseman 

The tack of free socialization contributes to the 
strict sexual codes in the area. 

There is "not muth sleeping around," notes 
Houseman. 



Culture 



Indonesia is similar to the United States in that it 
has cities that are divided between rural and urban land- 
scapes 

The biggest difference, however, is that the 
lifestyle -span between the two is much wider than in the 
United States. 

Most Indonesians that come to the United States are 
from larger ernes, such as Jakarta. 

The urban landscape of that city would prepare an 
Indonesian for some of the typical American sights. 

According to one Indonesian IPFW student, Jakarta 



Religion 



In a country of over 200 million people, approxi- 
mately 70 to 80 percent are Moslem. 

Because of the high populauon. the government has 
"suggested" that families have only two children. 

They only suggest because the Moslem majority 
would be against an enforced policy of controlling how 
many children a couple produced, said an IPFW 
Indonesian student. 

In addition to Moslems, then; are also Christians, 
Buddhists and Hindus in Indonesia. 

While students are taught to respect other religions, 
atheism is disliked because it is associated with 
Communism. 

"Number one is a belief in God," adds Houseman 



Education 




A child in Indonesia needs to be bom into at least a 
middle-class family to expect to receive an education 

"Parents pay more out-of-pocket (than in the 
U.S.)." says Houseman. "The poor may never go 
because schools are not well-financed " 

The trouble with receiving an education in 
Indonesia does not end after the primary-school years, 
either The country's few universities are not well- 
equipped. 

According to Houseman, the average university 
library has only about 10,000 books, and all the books 
are in English, which poses a problem because not 
everyone can read English 

If American students think that they have difficul- 
ties, they should imagine what their lives would be like 
if they had to go home every time they had to go to the 
bathroom. Indonesian universities do not have toilets 
installed. 

Comfort may be one of the many reasons why many 
Indonesian students come to the United Stales to further 
their educations whenever given the opportunity. 

"Having an American degree in Indonesia helps; it 
carries a lot of weight." says Houseman. 



According to one Indonesian IPFW student. 
Indonesians who return to their native country with an 
American degree often use them in many different 
ways. 

For the most pan, however, those who come back 
try to form schools, probably to counteract sub-standard 
conditions currently existing In tbeir native country. 

Business 

According to the findings of AG. Edwards and 
Son, a Fort Wayne slocks and bond brokerage. 
Indonesia will be fine in a few years, and no American 
companies will be affected. 

The American companies that are there-Dana, 
Nesde, and Dell Computers-do not seem to be having 
any difficulties yet. 

Dell Computers, in facL is doing well, despite the 
depression, which has made its product cheaper. 

Indonesia's most popular industries are low-tech. 
They produce such items as shoes, umbrellas and 
notepads, fhese type of items are then sent to the 
United States for sale. 

Perhaps Indonesia's current financial difficulties are 
a part of a natural cycle. Their economy was growing 
when the rest of the world's wasn't, says Houseman. 

That in itself is a reason for optimism 

"Nothing can go on forever," states Houseman. 



Conclusion 



Indonesia is a large Third World country that is cur- 
rently experiencing an economic depression that affects 
the rest of the world slowly. 

Its residenLs are faced with an uncertain future 
Tbey look for someone or something to blame, and 
since protesting in a major city could cost people's 
lives, it is done in rural areas 

Far too often, fellow countrymen of different eth- 
nicities are blamed. In a country without anything 
vaguely similar to social security or insurance of any 
kind, lie loss of a job or a piece of property is even 
more devastating than it is in the United States. 

Not surprisingly, some Indonesians question the 
sudden worldwide interest in their native country 

"No one talked about Indonesia." says one student. 
"Two years later, suddenly everyone comes up to me 
and says, 'Oh my gosh you're from Indonesia'" 

Even the most learned economic expert can do 
nothing except make an educated guess about when the 
trouble will end for Indonesia. 

"I'm hoping their troubles are over soon," says 
Houseman. "It's a nice place." 

He is confident that it will "all get back together one 
of these days." 

It would be nice to think so In the meantime, how- 
ever, maybe the request of an IPFW Indonesian student 
could be heeded, as he says, "Pray for us." 



Sparks fly at faculty meeting 



By Nol Beckley 

Editor 



Threats, intimidation, bully- 
ing," thundered John 
Brennan, associate profes- 
sor of English, as he criticized the 
centra] administration and some of 
their policies at Monday's faculty 
meeting, 

"We have a 'slander factory' in 
this administration," said Anson 
Shur*. professor of sociology and 
anthropology 

Sbupe spoke about the way the 
administration dealt with David 
Fairchild, who reported possible 
NCAA violations, Vicki Bcnckc. 
who has filed an anti-harassment 
suit against the university and Sue 
Skekloff, head of information sup- 
port services in Helmke Library, 
who have all been targets of the 
administration, be said. 

"I'm laying this at the feet of 
Ketder Hall," Shupe said. 



He said it was "inexcusable" for 
the administration to be spreading 
rumors about the mental stability of 
any university member. 

Brennan recalled a memo sent 
out by the Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Fcnwick English. 

According to Brennan. the 
memo was sent out during a low 
point in enrollment and contained a 
list of former students whom facul- 
ty should call and gel back into 
school 

Brennan praised this effort to 
increase enrollment He said enroll- 
ment rose. 

"Accompanying the list of stu- 
dents was something that spoiled it 
all. There was a threat to cut pro- 
grams and positions If enrollments 
did not recover with a reminder that 
these i in.-- need not be connected to 
the programs that enrollments are 
down," Brennan said, 

Peter ladicpla, associate profes- 
sor of sociology and anthropology, 
said he experienced a degree of 
iniimidaiion when he wrote an c- 
.'ll.hI critical of a certain policy, that 



was later reviewed to check and see 
if the message was in violation of 
the code of ethics. 

"When the administration feels 
that threatened in their position that 
they must resort to those forms of 
intimidation, there is something 
wrong here," ladicola said. 

Jane Banks, director of graduate 
studies and associate professor of 
communication, said faculty them- 
selves are as much to blame as the 
administration for the majority of 
personnel decisions 

Banks criticized the format for 
the faculty meetings. People want- 
ing to speak 10 the faculty are 
allowed two minutes to speak their 
piece. 

"Ii's not a discussion There's 
no give-and-take," she said. 

Pat vi, 1 I. associate professor 
of sociology and anthropology, 
agreed with Banks that die faculty 
meetings were not discussions, but 
added they had been constructive 

Asfaton questioned what kind of 
climate could create a forum like 
(his, 



"What is it about the climate 
that contributes to a place where 
rumor, reprisals and recriminations 
grow and flourish?" Ashton said. 

Ashton answered his own ques- 
tion with "It flourishes in a climate 
with an erosion of trust " 

"How different this university 
would be if the chancellor or vice 
chancellor came to you. the faculty, 
and said, 'Thanks for the job you 
do. You produce quality education 
at this institution. I'm proud of it 
and how can I help you do belter,'" 
Ashton said 

Some of the faculty have been 
skeptical of the accusations against 
the administration, said Michael 
Nusbaumer, associate professor of 
sociology and anthropology. 

"Just because something hasn't 
happened to you doesn't mean it's 
not happening to someone else," 
Nusbaumer said. 

Nusbaumer said the university 
lacks the leadership on campus to 
stop the personal attacks, which, in 
his opinion, arc at (he worst level he 
has seen in 30 years on campus.

Pay phones rip consumers off 



To the Editor: 

I'm sure by now most people 
have noticed thai pay phones now 
i "si 35 cents for a phone call. With 
[be deregulation of the pay phone 
business last October, this price 
increase does not come as a shock. 
Granted there has not been an 
increase in the price of calls on pay 
phones since 1988; this seems a 
warranted increase since inflation 
on almost every other item and ser- 
vice has raised its price also. 

What I have a problem with is 
that pay phones are not equipped to 



give change when two quarters are 
inserted. This means that when a 
person does not have proper change 
for the pay phone and inserts two 
quarters, they are paying 40 percent 
more for that phone call than anoth- 
er person who insens a quarter and a 
dime. 

Wben a company is offering a 
service to the public for a fee, it is 
the responsibility of that company to 
budget a certain amount of money 
for maintenance and improvements 
on their products and services. As 
one company's spokesman said in 
an article that appeared in the Feb. 



24 issue of the Journal Gazette, "It 
depends on the technology with 
which each individual phone is 
equipped." 

What is being done here is that 
GTE is trying to take the blame off 
the phone company to provide prop- 
erly functioning phones that give 
back the proper change by saying 
that the phones are not equipped to 
give back change. All that needs to 
be done is either program the enisl- 
ing phones lo give back the proper 
change or replace the phones with 
new ones that have the ability to 
give back change. In that statement, 



he is justifying stealing from the cit- 
izens. If the phones that are in oper- 
ation now are not equipped to prop- 
erly give back change it should be 
the responsibility of the owner to 
upgrade or replace them and doing 
this shows they are more interested 
in making money than providing 
proper service, even if it means 
stealing from the people. 

One telephone company owns 
more than 7.000 phones statewide 
and if on each one of those phones 
only one call a day was placed with 
two quarters, rather than a quarter 
and a dime, that equals out to a daily 



profit of S 1050 Monthly, that would 
equal out to around $31,500 and 
yearly it would be 5378,000. This 
phone company would be stealing 
from you and your loved ones. 

I, myself, refuse to support any 
company which would blatantly, 
outright steal from the citizens. If 
you allow big corporations to steal 
from you, what will come next? If 
you do not speak up against the 
heinous crime, who will be the next 
to follow suit? Will registers ai local 
restaurants stop giving back 
change? How would you feel if you 
bought a meal that cost S7.35; you 



paid with a $10 hill and the register 
operator said the register does not 
give back change anymore, so you 
endup paying S10 for a S7.35 meal 
This is a 40 percent increase in 
price Whether on a large scale or a 
small scale, stealing is stealing. So if 
you also feel stealing is wrong, 
stand up and let your voice be heard.

Writer defends article, position 



To the Editor; 

I would like to clear up. one ai 
a time, a few misunderstandings 
concerning the cloning article 
which appeared in the Feb. 12 edi- 
tion of The Communicator This is 
in response lo a letter published 
Feb 26. 

The Feb. 12 article was my 
opinion and so is this. 

Firsl of all, when I saw how 
my article had been changed, 
specifically the statement about 
biology. I was concerned that it 



would be attributed to me and not 
a mistake made by The 
Communicator staff, which it was. 
The statement, "Biology doesn't 
make a family, life does.'' initially 
read. "Biology doesn't make a 
I .irmly love does," The reasoning 
was thai there are people who are 
not biologically related, but who 
seem emotionally closer to each 
other than biologically related peo- 
ple. I know this from experience. 

"Cloning cheapens the value 
of life" is another statement I 



i i 




SpeoK no evil , ]Bjv ),&lt;:; 

hear no evil , set no cv{J 

W«fc one , it's not. like it matters 



would like to clarify The para- 
graph was making a comparison 
between sperm banks and cloning, 
but there was something that did 
not appear in the paper It was that 
cloning could be used as another 
excuse to be cruel because a 
cloned person could be considered 
not a real human being. It is logi- 
cal, therefore, to compare cloning 
to the commonly used justification 
for abortion, that il is not alive and 
not yet a human being. 

I have been made fun of 
because I have a disability. I 
believe (hat if a cruel person found 
out a particular individual bad 
been cloned, thai information 
could be used to make the individ- 
ual's life a living hell. It may be 
unlikely, but it is possible because, 
especially nowadays, the most per- 
sonal things seem to make iheir 
way into public. 

I guess, whether or not scientif- 
ic research has a purpose is subjec- 
tive. I was unaware that the scien- 
tist from Sweden had a reason for 
cloning other than just because we 
have the technology, which is 
unjustifiable, in my opinion. The 
reason for research or the intended 
result of it is the issue, not whether 
research should be done at all 

In hindsight. I realized a differ- 
ent and valid interpretation of the 
statement concerning organ dona- 
tion could be made and thus I 
wished I had reworded the stale- 
mem. 

Implying thai we should invent 
more disabilities is ridiculous and 
cruel. I believe the disabdities in 
existence today were caused by 
nature/God and He knew what He 
was doing. That is not a debate I 
care lo get into any further. My 
point is thai no matter how many 
breakthroughs we have in science. 



there is no way we can be as per- 
fect as God. 

Furthermore, it's hard enough 
to handle the disabilities that 
already exist. Some people are able 
to thrive in spite of them, but some 
are not, so intentionally making 
more is inhumane, to say the least. 

"It (science) is simply a tool 
that people use and it is these peo- 
ple that apply their morals and 
ethics to the use of science" was 
the point 1 trying to make If the 
technology doesn't exist il can't 
get into the wrong hands and cause 
more problems Though Hider did 
not manipulate genetics as cloning 
does, he did seek to nd the world 
of the people he thought were infe- 
rior The staff editorial from sever- 
al weeks ago on the same topic 
made the same basic point. 

On the other hand, you were 
correct when you stated that trying 
to ban everything remotely danger- 
ous is impossible and maybe a bit 
silly' because even a razor in the 
wrong hands could hurt someone. 
You were also correct in saying 
that comparing the dangers of 
razors to cloning is very simplistic. 

In conclusion, the recent letter 
to the editor brought up some good 
points, and I concur that the Feb. 
12 article was not written as well 
as it could and should have, in 
spite of the space restrictions I was 
trying to adhere to. 

Thank you to Jason Pesetski 
for his letter to the editor because 
il's careful readers like him who 
make me a belter writer.

Let it be said- 



The Communicator extends a sincere 
welcome to any and all members of the 
student body who are interested in work- 
ing for IPFW's student newspaper. We 
are looking for students with diverse 
backgrounds and from all majors to par- 
ticipate In all sections of the paper. 
Experience is not necessary. Whether 
you are a writer, artist, phMograpber, or 
have an opinion about something, be 
assured that your participation will be 
appreciated and will make a difference. 



Over the past few weeks the 
faculty of IPFW have been involved 
with convocation meetings dealing 
with their concerns of how the cam- 
pus is being run 

One concern, in particular, 
includes a review of Chancellor 
Michael Wartell and Vice- 
Chancellor Fenwick English. And. 
surpnsc, surprise, we are all for the 
evaluation proceedings to start 

We believe that in order for 
anyone to better themselves a cri- 
tique of their work is necessary 

For example, writers are cri- 
tiqued on a regular basis. Items may 
be cut out of a story, pbrases 
changed and edited, that is how we 
learn lo become betier writers. 
Without these constant evaluations 
of our work we couldn't improve 

So what is the administration 
afraid of We don't think ihe facul- 
ty is out of line, they are just trying 
to improve our campus We'd like 
to think (he Chancellor would have 
the same goals.

word. 

Maybe (hen the faculty could

ing and the administration t 
to . . .whatever they do. 

Basically whal we are saying is 
thai in any work place there arc 
going to be reviews and evalua- 
tions. This is how you grow into ah 
improved person/employee. I 

Chancellor Wartell should be 
yelling, "YES. evaluate me. tell mt 
how I can improve in order lo mak£ 
IPFW a ncher learning insutuiion." 

Dodging the bullet is unprofesv 
sional and lells everyone involve* 
with ihe campus how much be ■ 
interesied in advancing our collega 
lo higher levels. 

We believe that for our campus 
lo broaden its horizons certain 
issues have to be resolved. If left 
hanging and unsettled the dirty 
"reign" will descend upon IPFW 
like El Nino on California. Anil 
we'll all get washed away in floods 
of mudslinging and sand bags 

Our hopes are those of a posj 
live resolution, so we can all gi 
back to educaUon. learning 
improving ourselves.

Local critics don't measure up 



What's Yitak. tdis Weefc: Dennis Donafiue 




Have you ever noticed how 
critical we are of each other? I 
mean, everybody has an opinion on 
something Abortion, bombing Iraq, 
racism, the designated hitter, you 
name it. we are bound to disagree. 
Personally. I think this is healthy, as 
dialogue is good Talking about 
things shapes the way we think in 
our daily lives. If you don't believe 
in Clinton's political ideologies, 
then convince mc whal be has done 
is wrong. Just an example folks, 
leave Monica out of this! 

I have lived in the area for 
almost four years now. I just can't 
relate to the ultra-conservative 
newspapers And mainstream local 
radio, well, let's just say 1 quit lis- 
tening about three years ago. God, 
how much Bob Scger, Skynard and 
Collective Soul can you guys take? 
Within these mediums, he (pun 
intended) the paid "journalists" 
who on a daily basis, spew out the 
knowledge of their sis years of col- 
lege. Don't get me wrong, not 



everyone in the local press is bad 
But two people come to mind, who 
in my opinion, have lost touch with 
the real world They happen lo both 
be women, which is coincidence, so 
don't think I'm sexist They are 
Sandy Thorn Clark and Catherine 
Lee. 

First, let's talk about Sandy. 
She calls herself a "food-critic " 
Going to restaurants and eating 
food makes all of us critics if you 
ask mc I hope they don't pay her 
much because she is just awful. 
Personal attacks aren't really whal 
I'm into; however, when it seems as 
if over 12,000 students, friends, 
restaurant managers and owners 
and even total strangers have said, 
"Dude, thai Sandy Clark lady is 
weak, what is your opinion?" She'll 
never sec this, so what the hell 

First of all, "chain" and fran- 
chise eateries should be left com- 
pletely off the lisi to review Period. 
I don'i care about Applcbee's or 
Bob Evans. What, is ihe ice in 



McDonald's Cokes not big enough 
10 keep the dnnk cold? And don'l 
get mc started with her "lists" she 
put out every month or so. because 
her columns become crusty and for- 
gotten She loves the high-end 
places, and will dog all of the small- 
er places thai don't suit her person- 
ality I don't frequent the snobby 
places she loves, I might run into 
her. This would be unfortunate for 
her. 

Sucking up is her specialty; she 
always says something good about 
Ihe place she is reviewing. And 
Hall's has like the best food on the 
planet in her opinion. Give me a 
break. So how much money is the 
paper giving her to go stuff her face 
every week? She likes to mention 
her different visits, as to state that 
she is fair and everyone deserves a 
second chance Puh-lease. I have 
interviewed five managers whom 
she has reviewed in the past seven 
weeks. They all say about the same 
thing "We don't feel thai she has 



the qualifications that suit the din- 
ers in the Fon Wayne area. They are 
smarter than her and bad reviews 
only seem to boost our sales This is 
how our regular customers show 
support " Yep. just as I thought 

And what about her ratings sys- 
tem? I think she uses stars, but 
instead of five stars for overall 
quality, like the industry norm, she 
uses them in two different ways 
Two for atmosphere, and three for 
food service. You'll have to check 
on that one, I don't pay much atten- 
tion to her. Something she always 
mentions is lettuce. It is always 
willed or dry. ITS LETTUCE! Gel 
over it Get over yourself. Also, 
what is "over-friendly service"? 
When they see her walk in ihe door. 
they (servers) know, that no matter 
what, they will gel ripped on. I 
salute the poor souls that have bad 
lo wail on her. Ten bucks says she's 
never worked in food service. Walk 
a mile in iheir shoes before being so 
judgmental. 



And what's up WhaizUp? Are 
you serious with this Catherine 
Lee'' Her movie reviews read like 
my five-year-old niece's would I 
read thai she is the executive direc- 
tor at the Cinema Center. Director 
of what, concessions? When I read 
her review of Batman Forever, 
which by the way sucked, she went 
on and on about how cute George 
Clooney was I fell like I was read- 
ing her diary She kepi comparing 
the character from IK lo Batman. I 
didn't gel her point it was hard 10 
finish She got completely lost in 
how "hot" she thought be was. and 
how the director of the film didn't 
let him (Clooney) be "himself 
Huh? 

You see Caihy, they are actors 
None of H is real, okay? How can 
she be ihe executive director of a 
movie theater with this kind of slani 
on the industry? Also, not every 
movie has a hidden sexual agenda, 
so get off the feminist bandwagon. 
And remember, some movies are 



awful; it's okay to disagree with 
real critics and go oui on your own 
Nobody likes a copy-cat. 

Miz Lee also gabs on ihe very 
respectable WBNI radio station 
which is, by the way, a very cool 
morning show alternative. She con- 
stand y interrupts her co-bosi and 
feels thai it is her show for some 
reason I think she needs to listen to 
herself on tape to notice that she is 
doing it It is unprofessional and 
very rude. Other people's opinions 

LOSER OF THE WEEK; 
People who throw away their alu- 
minum cans They are recyclable 
you loser! Toss'em in a container, 
which there needs to be more of, 
but try to help ihe planet a Hide bit 
will ya? And can we get something 
lo recycle the plastic boiiles with? 
It's bad enough they're a dollar, 
lei's try to use them again Maybe a 
boycott on Pepsi could lower the 
prices ... Have a great break and be 
careful 




Grad student disagrees with columnist's opinion 



To the Editor 

This letter is written in response 
to Susan Spindler's column in the 
Feb 19 issue ofThe Communicator. 
in which she complained aboul the 
necessity of having gradV undergrad 
spill courses in the English 
Department I thought it might be 
interesting to have a graduate point 
of view on the issue. 

I wish, oh how I wish, that the 
only difference in a grad's require- 
ments was "ihe paper," 1 would do 
dances in the street and burn 
incense to Ihe deities of requisites if 
that were the case. 1 would be able 
to devote evenings to leisure read- 
ing and spending time with my cais 
if all 1 bad to do was write "an extra 
paper " But. alas, the paper is pre- 
ceded by a proposal for the paper, 
and the proposal is preceded by 
research for ihe (sometimes anno- 
tated) bibliography due with the 
paper. As if that weren't enough, the 
paper must be written to graduate- 
level requirements— you know, all 
those snap-of- the -finger tricks like 
incorporating muludisciplinary the- 
ories of analysis, flawless prose and 
lightly focused theses into seamless 
and publishable essays 

Thus, an undergraduate paper I 
wrote thai received an A would, by 
graduate standards, be dam lucky to 



get a D, length notwithstanding 
Further, though I lake the same 
exam, again my responses are held 
to a higher standard, even further, 
grads are often required to present 
material lo the class in preparation 
for teaching. So. the "extra paper" is 
a misconception alt by itself. 

As for the classroom atmos- 
phere, well,. I have never had a 
class, either as an undergrad or a 
grad, where the class is "split rather 
evenly:" the undergrads always pre- 
dominate. Regardless, both as an 
undergrad and a grad, I love the 
environment of most of my split 
courses. Since Literature is my 
"thang," bow can 1 complain if 
someone in the class tries to take the 
discussion to a higher level? How 
can I not benefit from being 
exposed lo others' interpretations, 
whatever their class status? Yes, 



occasionally I gel bored with hear- 
ing trite, commonplace and highly 
glaringly obvious interpretations of 
the text at hand, but then the discus- 
sion can take off from there, and it 
often does, with undergrads in the 
lead I get frustrated with covering 
ihe "basics," material that should 
have been internalized before ever 
registering for a 300 or 400 level 
course, but then again, maybe I 
need an occasional brush-up, too. 

In other words, though our 
English and Linguistics Department 
must, for reasons of economy, place 
grads and undergrads together, I 



think there are more positive ways cussion, since I'm one of those

A strange thing happened on 
the rughi of the Grammy* Well, 
actually several things happened to 
make this years Grammys one that 
will go down in the books as cer- 
tainly the most unusual. 

It definitely was the year for 
stage -crashing After Sean "Puffy" 
Combs received his award for best 
rap album. ODB &lt;Ol' Dirty 
Bastard) of the Wu-Tang Clan had 
other words to say. 

ODB went up on the stage, 
fashionably dressed in red velvet, 
and had a few words for Puffy 
ODB later apologised for his 
actions and said, "PufTy's alright, 
but Wu-Tang is for the children" 

The list of nominees for musi- 
cal album for children did not 
include the Wu-Tang Clan. 

Tbe next person to stage-crash 
was a little more creative. A shirt- 
less man stormed the stage during 
Bob Dylan's performance with the 
words "Soy Bomb" painted on bis 
chest. The man was then promptly 
taken off the stage, and questioned 
by authorities. Bob Dylan was left 
speechless. 

Marilyn Manson, who was 
invited to the show, did not make 
an appearance It didn't seem like 
he was missed much either 

Kelsey Grammer stated to tbe 
audience, "You have my word as a 
gentleman that you will not be see- 
ing his bony white ass on stage this 
evening." Some of the audience 
cheered. 

On a morbid note, all of the 
awards for children's albums went 
to people that have passed on. The 
late John Denver received an 
award for the best musical album 
for children 

Actually, bis son picked up the 
award and told tbe audience that it 
would be put in a special place. 
The name of Denver's album was 
titled "All aboard!" 

Obviously, Denver should 
have been more interested in trains 
than planes Charles Kuralt 



received the award for spoken 
word album for children with a 
version or Winnie- the -pooh, as 
well as the spoken word album for 
Cbarles Kuralt's Spring. 

Movies also had a big impact 
on the Grammys. Eight Grammys 
went to songs that were in or made 
for films Most of them were for 
R Kelly's. "1 Believe I Can Fly" 
from the Space lam soundtrack. 

When R, Kelly received his 
award be was sure to thank 
Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny. 
Other songs that won were from 
the films Men in Black, Con Air, 
Batman and Robin, and The 
English Patient. 

Chris Rock received the award 
for best spoken comedy album 
with "Rock with the New." 

When he was asked about hav- 
ing won so many Emmys and 
Grammys lately, he replied, "Well, 
eventually I'm going to sell them 
all for drugs." 

Well, 1 hope that he has learned 
from other comedian greats such as 
Belushi and Farley that drugs 
aren't the way logo. 

Now for the part that everyone 
really watched the show for. the 
people that actually won tbe 
awards 

The big winners were definite- 
ly the Dylan family, Bob with three 
and two for Jakob. R. Kelly also 
brought home three grammys for 
"1 Believe I can Fly " 

On the other side of the spec- 
trum was the teen sensation &lt;If you 
want to call them that) Hanson 
who went home empty handed. 

Well, they still have plenty 
years of music to earn a Grammy 
In fact, they still have a few years 
to complete puberty Paula Cole 
was definitely disappointed that 
she didn't get to take home the six 
Grammys that she was nominated 
for. 

She had to settle for the best 
new artist award. 

LeAnn Rhymes bad to watch 
her Grammy hopes walk away 
with Trisha Yearwood, who was 
nominated for singing her version 
of the same song.

What if? 



Neighborhood grill makes good 



By Kathryn Meichsner 
Staff Writer 

One of the places 1 have always 
liked: going is Applebee's. 

Since I had not been there in a 
while, one of my friends and I 
decided that it would be a good 
place to have dinner. 

A friendly hostess greeted us at 
the door. We asked for no n- smoking 
and were seated nght away. Tbe 
decor inside varies quite a bit 
Pictures and signs cover the walls 

One wall was covered with 
Fury memorabilia; over each of the 
tables bangs a light. 




We need a Macintosh 
680 or better. If there is 
one of these dinosaurs 

out there collecting dust 
that you would like to 

donate to a non-for-profit 

organization like The 

Communicator please 

call 48 1-6583. 



Overall. I would say the atmos- 
phere was casual and relaxed, giv- 
ing the guest a very comfortable and 
almost familiar place to eat. Our 
server greeted us soon after we were 
seated. He was friendly and his 
upbeat attitude was a nice touch 

Applebee's has a variety of 
items on their menu They offer 
everything from salads to steaks to 
pasta. 

For an appetizer we ordered 
mozzarella sticks. There is not 
much to say about mozzarella 
sticks, except they were good 

As for dinner, 1 ordered the 
Same Fe Chicken Salad It con- 



tained red, blue and yellow com 
chips It also had diced tomatoes 
and cheese on it The salad dressing 
was creamy and had nice tangy 
taste. On top of all this was the 
grilled chicken The salad was 
excellent, although the chicken was 
a little dry. 

My friend ordered a 10-oz. sir- 
loin steak which he had prepared 
medium rare. It was prepared very 
well and it was quite tender. He also 
received onions and potatoes with 
his meal 

Then came dessert time 
Desserts are my weakness. We 
ordered the Carmel Apple Crunch 



Ala Mode It is an apple crunch 
with a scoop of ice cream on the 
side and carmel dribbled all over it 
It was delicious. 

The meals range between $6.99 
to $12 99 There are three 
Applebee's located in Fort Wayne. 
One is on North Clinton across from 
the Coliseum; another is on Lima 
Road next to Meijers and tbe third is 
in Coventry Plaza 

1 give Applebee's four out of 
five stars The service was excellent 
and tbe food was flavorful 
Applebee's offers a relaxed atmos- 
phere in which to enjoy a good 
meal

Twenty years ago, George

Prepare yourself for the jump to

Holy Trinity of science fiction

what could be the biggest film in 
history Shooting has wrapped up on 
the first film, "Balance of the 
Force " This title is only a working 
title and could be wrong. 

"Balance of the Force" is set 
about 40 years before Star Wars "A 
New Hope." 

Neeson stars as Qui-Gon Jinn, 
an elder Jedi Knight, who is leading 
the fight for the survival of the 
ancient, mystic religion against 
mercenaries possibly led by Star 
Wars cult icon, Boba Feu. 

Jake Lloyd (Jingle All the Way) 
plays 8-year-old Anakin Skywalker, 
ji.ii Darth Vader. From wide- 
spread reports, the young 
Skywalker will be a heroic and pure 
figure, therefore his fall from grace 
will be much more painful to

Chinese musicians 
perform on campus 



Bv Joan Poulsen 
Staff Writer 



On Sunday, Fort Wayne had a 
rare opportunity to hear a free 
Chinese Classical Music Concert. 
The husband and wife performers, 
Wei Yang and Betty Xiang Yang, 
performed for over 100 people in 
Neff Recital hall. 

Both musicians were bom in 
Shanghai and have played since 
they were young children. They 
have performed in Europe as well 
as Asia 

They now reside near Chicago, 
where they perform occasionally 
and teach Chinese music, 

Betty Xiang Yang played the 
ehru and Wei Yang played the pipa 
and yang-qin The ehru is a 
Chinese instrument which resem- 
bles the violin, especially in sound. 

It has two strings and a bow 
which passes between the strings 
to produce a legato violin-like 
sound. 

The pipa is much like a lute (a 
medieval instrument which 
evolved into the guitar). It is 
strummed or plucked with plectra 
worn on the fingertips Plectra are 
a small type of pick used to accu- 
rately pluck the strings. 

The yang-qin is an accompani- 
ment instrument which resembles 
a hammer dulcimer (like a large 
autoharp played by striking it with 
special mallets) and sounds some- 
what like a large piano It was used 
to accompany the ehru on a num- 
ber of pieces. 

The concert was presented as a 
series of ehru solos and pipa solos, 
closing with two ehru-pipa duets 

Betty Xiang Yang performed 
six ehru solos including "A 
Mountain Village" by Yaoxing 
Chen. "A Mountain Village" was 
very lively and sounded like a 
Dixie folksong played on a fiddle 

Most of ber other selections 
sounded very traditionally 
Chinese. They were majestic, 
relaxing and flowing. 

Wei Yang also performed six 
solos including "Excerpt" from 
"Ambush From All Sides," a 
vibrant and furious traditional 



Chinese song about an ancient bat- 
tle', Wei Yang performed one song 
the entire audience knew, the 
American folksong "Home on the 
Range." 

At the end of the concert, after 
a standing ovation, Betty Xiang 
Yang gave an expressive encore 
performance of "Ave Maria" on 
ehru Wei Yang performed the 
song, "You are my Sunshine" on 
pipa for his encore. 

The concert was sponsored by 
the Fort Wayne Chinese Family 
and Friends Association, the Fort 
Wayne Three Rivers Festival 
Chinese Committee, the IPFW 
Department of Music, the IPFW 
Department of Sociology and 
Anthropology and the Office of 
International Students Services at 
IPFW 

Those who anended seemed to 
enjoy the concert 

"It was an excellent perfor- 
mance Their skill is very good," 
said Bill Newcum, who attended 
the concert with his family. 

Wei-Li Chen, treasurer of Fort 
Wayne Family and Friends 
Association, saw the Yangs per- 
form in Chicago She said it was 
important to bnng the live concert 
to Fort Wayne so that everyone in 
the area could have the opportuni- 
ty to experience a piece of Chinese 
culture which is a rarely available 
locally 

Wen-Hui Tsai, professor of 
sociology and head of the ethnic 
and culture studies program, pro- 
vided humorous intros for the pro- 
gram as emcee. 

He agreed with Chen that 
Sunday's performance was a great 
chance to gain exposure to Chinese 
culture. 

"There arc more and more 
business people in Fort Wayne 
expanding their business to China 
I think that IPFW is the cultural 
center here 

We could provide some oppor- 
tunity to be familiarized with the 

Chinese culture" Tsai said.

Wow! What a volleyball game 
that was lasi Saturday night. If you 
weren't there I feel sorry for you 
because you missed the best sport- 
ing action going on in the Fort, 

The first thing I noticed as I 
walked into Gates was the number 
of observers in the bleachers. 1 was 
extremely excited 10 see thai both 
sides of the tiers were pretty full 
and crowd participation was high. 
Although, thai wasn't too difficult 
lo come by, considering thai our 
THREE squads of cheerleaders 
were there to boost support. 

The first game, as exciting as it 
was, ended up being a warm-up for 
the rest of the match. It was, how- 
ever, the closest the Cardinals 
came to the Dons. With two game- 
point chances, the Dons pulled it 
out with a 15-9 win. 

The second game was when 
things started to get hot. We were 
down 3-4 when Javier Escobar 
acquired one of his 12 kills to give 
IPFW the serve. With that we were 
ahead 5-4. but this didn't last, Bali 
State came back to lead 5-7 due to 
a couple flubbed plays where the 
set ball had no hitter and it fell to 
the floor. Then a sideout serve gave 
the Cardinals possession, three 
points to Ball State. 

But never fear, the Dons re- 
grouped and suddenly we were up 
14-8. On the first game point vol- 
ley Chris Farmer showed his 
tremendous hustle and built-in 
determination as he dove over the 
score table to try and save the ball 
for the win. On our fifth game 
point. Farmer served to start a 
great volley that was finished by 
Javier Escobar's kill that was 
blocked out of bounds. Second 
game goes to IPFW, 15-8. 

Now, the third game of the 
match was not only thrilling, but it 
made history. It was the first time 
the Dons have held the Cardinals 
scoreless in a game. Ves. that's 
right we blew them right out of 
Gates Center. Not to mention this 



was the first match we've won 
against Ball State since the '94 sea- 
son. 

The Dons were up fast in the 
third, proving that massive block- 
ing and hustle pays off. With the 
Dons up 6-0 and the serve, Ricardo 
Soler "schooled" the Cardinals 
with an awesome fake spike thai he 
effortlessly tipped over me net. The 
Cardinals could not recover quick- 
ly enough and the ball hit the floor. 
poini to IPFW. 

With possession of the ball and 
the score 10-0. Javier Escobar had 
the serve and sent the ball out of 
bounds. But. with style, Javier

Then, with the score 12-0. 
Chris Gisslen won the "Smooth

over the net. unexpectedly, instead 
of selling it. He had us all faked 
out, not just Ball State. Nice move, 
Chris! 

The Dons then proceeded to 
shut out Ball Stale in Ihe third 
game. 15-0, to win ihe malch.

Volleydon Hector Soto goes up (or one ol his 17 kills in Saturday 
nights game against Ball Slate 



IPFW looking to take lead in conference 



By Tony Laui 

Sports Editor 

Ohio Slate is coming and the 
lead of the Midwesi Intcrcollegiaie 
Volleyball Association (MIVA&gt; is on 
ibe line Ohio State is 13-1 overall 
and is undefeated in the conference 

Ohio State's only loss came at 
Stanford University where they lost 
in five matches IPFW's only loss 
came early this season at Ohio State 

The Buckeyes are led by junior 
Colin McMillan and setter Angle 
Aja but they have a very balanced 
attack. Six players are averaging 
over 3 kills a game so it will be bard 
to focus on one player to stop 

IPFW is coming into the game 
after a very huge win against Ball 
State Tbe Dons crushed tbe 
Cardinals in three straight matches, 
including a 15-0 victory in the final 
match Coach Amie Ball feels that 
the key for his team to win is to con- 
tinue to develop consistency in its 
level of play 

Even though he doesn't pay 
attention to bis personal achieve- 
ments this game also could be career 
win 300 But be doesn't like to talk 
about it because be doesn't want 
anything to distract his team from its 
goal of winning a National 
Championship. 

"We will need to play good 
offense in the middle and strong 
backcourt defense to win against 



Obio State," said Ball "Ohio Slate 
bas a real diverse offense that 
spreads the ball around so it will be 
tougb to play defense against them ." 

Ohio State goes very deep on 
tbe bench with nine returning letter- 
men and four starters from last 
year's team. 

A major strength for the team is 
they are passing the ball well and 
not making errors Ohio State's bit- 
ting percentage is .362 and oppo- 
nents are only hitting .254. 

"Tbe player we need to watch is 
Jeff Koterba." said Ball. "He is 
averaging 5 21 kills a game" 
Koterba also leads Ohio Slate in ser- 
vice aces 

Following the game against 
Ohio Stale is Quincy. After Coach 
Ball watched some videotape on tbe 
Hawks, be decided that (bey are an 
underrated team 

"Quincy is a much better team 



than their record shows," said Ball. 
"If we look past them we wdl be in 
a lot of trouble." 

Quincy is trying to build a com- 
petitive team but has a long road in 
front of them. 

The Hawks only return three let- 
termen from last year and just two 
of them were starters Coach Tun 
Koih is in his second season and has 
his work cut out for him with eleven 
freshman on his rosier 

Steve Drexler and Joe Pearson 
are the "go to" guys for the Hawks 
Last year Drexler ranked second in 
the MIVA in aces per game and fifth 
in digs per game while Pearson is 
the only other reluming starter. 

The Dons will travel to Puerto 
Rico March 8-15 where they will 
face American University of Pueno 
Rico, Concordia College and the 
Puerto Rican National Team in an 
exhibition game.

Baseball ready for tough road trip 



By Tony Laux 
Sports Editor 

The mens baseball team did 
what they were supposed to 
do, on paper, They swept 
Virginia Inlermont 13-12 and 7-5 
and lost to "5 North Alabama 3-2 
and 18-1 Some coaches would be 
happy that their team was competi- 
tive, but head coach Tony Vittorio 
isn't satisfied with bis team's 
results. 

"It was a disappointing week- 
end because we were two runs short 
from being 3-1 on the weekend." 
said Vittorio. 

The team scored runs welt, but 
didn't make hits when it was criti- 
cal. 

"We set the table offensively but 
we didn't finish our plate." said 
Vittorio. "Not coming through with 
hits cost us a game," said Vittorio 
"We will be working on hit-and-run 
all this week so (hat we can work on 
our situational hitting." 

This was very critical against 
North Alabama when Danny 
Mathews pitched a complete game. 
but lost by one run 

Another focus of worry for the 
team Is pitching. The team gave up 
37 runs in these four games while 
only scoring 23. 

"We need pitchers Keith 
Weaver, Curtis Wagers and Matt 
Eipelding to step up for this team lo 
do well," said Vittorio. "All three of 
these pitchers are new to Division II 
baseball and it could be first game 
jitters but they clearly struggled this 
weekend." 

"The pitchers goi some experi- 
ence but they need to learn that tbey 
have to hit spots at this level," said 
pitching coach Guy Keller. "Now 
that they have this game under their 
belt they should be ready to step up 
and pitch better." 

Danny Mathews started the sea- 
son with a beautiful pitching perfor- 
mance against «5 North Alabama. 
He handcuffed the Lions and 



allowed only three runs. Four other 
players who stepped up this week- 
end were Ryan Wallace, Bill 
Seagerman. Jason JaJTe and Dwayne 
Kuhn Wallace went 6-14 for the 
weekend to bring his average to 
.429. Seagerman baited 400 on the 
weekend with one bomerun Jaffe 
picked up right where he left off last 
season by going 4-6 in the first 
game 

"Kuhn didn't have the best 
numbers but he hit the farthest ball 
that I have ever seen in my life," 
said Vittorio 'This was a 500-ft. 
shot and no ballpark in the world 
would have kept it in." 

The team did well in most 
offensive categories As a team the 
Dons hit .276 and hit seven doubles. 
Matt Dressier collected three of the 
doubles for the Dons The team also 
showed good speed on the base 
paths by stealing five bases and only 
getting caught once 

The other loss to North 
Alabama was by a huge score but 
should be a learning experience for 
the team. "If we paid attention to 
that game we should team that once 
you gel somebody down you've goi 
to bury them.'' said Vittorio "We 
played solid defense but North 
Alabama put their HI and #2 pitch- 
ers against us and it shows us that 
they respected our offense." 

The team will have to learn 
quickly because in the next week 
they will play seven games against 
some quality talent The Dons will 
play two games each at Wilmington 
College, Kings College. Carson- 
Newman and University of 
Kentucky 

Wilmington College is the only 
Division III team on the schedule 
but if IPFW isn't ready to play they 
could easily lose these two games 
because of Wilmington's hardnosed 
style of play. Kings College 
(NAIA&gt; is a young and scrappy 
team that could test the Don's pitch- 
ing staff with their aggressiveness. 
Carson-Newman will be look- 



ing for blood after being pounded in 
(wo games this weekend, but 
Kentucky will be the toughest team 
on the schedule. 

Kentucky is 3-6 on the year, but 
is starting to become a force in the 
South East Conference (SEC). The 
Wildcats are led by senior David 
Cheade who is batting .444 with six 
multi-hit games. Catcher Josh 
Loggins and left-fielder Andy 
Bendix arc both are hitting .333 for 
the Wildcats and could prove to be 
too tough for the Dons if the pitch- 
ing staff isn't ready to play 
Kentucky's team ERA is over seven. 
so scoring runs shouldn't be too 
much of a problem for the offense. 

Coach Vittorio thinks that 
Kentucky may be looking past 
IPFW and may not put their best 
pitcher on the mound. 

"We will probably face their 
number six pitcher and it will be a 
win-win situation for us," said 
Vittorio "If we lose we were sup- 
posed to lose but if we win it will 
show the country that we are a team 
to be reckoned wiib."
