Book price increase expected for spring 




Manager of Foiled'! 



ByJOHNMcGAULEY 
Staff Writer 
The spring semester is just around 
the corner and minds are turning to 
thoughts of buying new books and 
selling back those used during the fall. 
Jim Ward, manager of Follett's, the 
IPFW bookstore, says students can 
expect an eight to nine percent hike in 
book prices from last semester, a trend 
he attributes to publishers' increases. 
Most expensive of those books found at 
Follett's, according to Ward, are those 
texts using a lot of color and graphics, 
such as general chemistry- 
Science students can expect lo spend 
the most on books, with an average of 
around $80-$100 Finishing out the list 



are business and English students, who 
can expect lo spend anywhere between 
530 and 550. 

Ward attributes the high prices of 
some textbooks to heavy market 
research, marketing of books, and 
represenla lives who are paid lo sell the 
books lo stores such as Follett's. These 
are all expenses incurred by the 
publisher and which must be figured 
into the price of books. Also, when an 
instructor specifies a certain texlbook 
for a course, this limits the ability to 
"shop around" to find a more 
reasonable price. Most books are only 
available from one source. 

The most costly individual books used 
al IPFW, according lo Ward, are 



medical education texts, using an 
abundance of color plates and graphics 
and also having a small market. 
Recently, a cap on the price of these 
taxts was put into affect by publishers, 
because, as Ward described, "they 
were quickly becoming outrageous." 
Ward described the policy used in 
buying back used books as "all supply 
and demand," meaning that if a lext 
has become outdated or is no longer 
used by instructors, they won't buy it 
back. When books are bought back, the 
most that will be paid for them is half of 
the original price. Occasionally, 
Follett's will be stuck with a supply of 
used texts no longer required at IPFW, 
in which case they are sold to book 
wholesalers. 



Accident involves IPFW vehicle 



By M1CHELE R. SHAFFER 
Editor-in-Chief 
A university vehicle driven by an 
employee was involved in an accident 
with a vehicle driven by an IPFW 
student, Stephen Roby, IPFW chief of 
police, verified Tuesday. 

The accident occurred at 10:29 a.m. 
Tuesday at the corner of East Campus 
and South Campus drives when a 
vehicle driven by Stephen Schenk, an 
IPFW student, was eastbound on South, 
Campus Drive al a normal rale of 
speed. Schenk attempted to negotiate 
the turn onto East Campus Drive and 
Ihe vehicle slid Al the same time, a 
truck driven by Richard J. Dirrim. a 
university employee was unable to stop 
in time lo avoid hitting Schenk's car, 
Roby said Tuesday. 

Roby said damage estimates (o the 
university-owned Iruck were under 
$200. Estimates of damage to the 
student's car range between 51 ,000 and 
52.500. 

Roby said all accidents causing lolal 
damages of more than 5500 are 
reporled lo the Indiana State Police. 

Officials from the Indiana Slate 
Police said that as a matter of public 
record and departmental policy they do 
release names of persons involved in 
vehicular accidents to the public. 

Roby and John Carnaghi, vice 
chancellor (or financial affairs, were 
reluctant Tuesday lo release the names 
of individuals involved. 

Indiana Code 5-14-1-3, The Right To 
Inspect Public Records, slates: " ... by 
law, every citizen of this slate shall 
during regular business hours of all 
administrative bodies or all agencies of 
the state, or any political subdivision 
thereof, have the right to inspect the 
public records of such administrative 
bodies or agencies, and to make 
memoranda abstracts from the records 

Indiana Code 5-14-1-2, defines the 
term public record: " ... the lerm 
'public record' shall mean any writing 
in any form necessary, under or 
required or directed lo be made by any 
statute or by any rule or regulation of 
any administrative body or agency of 
die slate or any of its political sub- 
divisions."

A car driven by on IPFW student and a vehicle driven by a 
university employee collided Tuesday morning when the 
student attempted lo negotiate a turn onto East Campus

estimated al somewhere between $1,000 and $2,500 (Photo

document dated December 1983 which 
says the university is nol obligated lo 
release names of the involved. The 
document is a series of questions and 
answers with university attorneys 
Carnaghi also cited pre-existing 
statute, Indiana Code 9-4-1-51 which 
concerns accident reports, sup- 
plemental reports and confidential 
information. 

Carnaghi decided to release the 
names on Wednesday morning after 
discussing Ihe situation with university 



attorneys and the police chief at Purdue 
University. West Lafayette. 

Carnaghi said Wednesday lhat a 
students' name is protected by the 
Buckley Amendment only in cases 
involving a student's academic 
situation. 

Carnaghi said the Indiana Code 
pertaining to public records overrides 
the Indiana Code 9-1-1-51 and the 
Buckley Amendment. The Indiana code 
about accident reports initially cited 
does apply lo incidents still under in- 
vestigation, however Ihe names can be 



Roby said a report on Tuesday's 
accident should be tiled within five days 
to the Indiana Slale Police. According 
lo Indiana State Police deparlment 
practices, the names could have been 
released then if they nol already had 
been obtained 

Roby was recently appointed lo chief 
ol police al IPFW He has been with the 
department for 14 years.

careers. "Al worst, sludents succeeded 
as well as the average student, "O'Hear 
said. "At best, students succeeded by a 
significant degree." 

Academic advising is available for 



students who list English as a second 
language. These students must lake on 
English proficiency test to gain ad- 
mittance at IPFW. Should an individual 
need assistance, the center is prepared 
to provide extensive help with the 
English language. 

The Learning Center alsu serves as a 
support group for adult students 
returning lo college after a long ab- 
sence. A special orientation program 
lias been designed specifically for the 
individual who has been out of school 
for three or more years. 

A series of one hour workshops 
covering note-taking, test-taking, and 
textbook-reading re-acquaint the 
returning student to the learning 
process. A 20-minule video on study 
skills is available at the center and con 
be viewed al the convenience of the 
individual. New students can profit 
from (hesc programs, too. 

Students in need of tutorial help can 
acquire the names of qualified student 
tutors from The Learning Center. 
Accommodations are not available for 
the tutor to work with the student at the 
center, consequently, after both parties 
have been introduced, they must decide 
on a suitable allernative. The expenses 
for this service has been paid for out of 
the Student Activity Fees; therefore, 
there is no charge to the sludenl for this 
service. 

Carol Alkman. assistant director, is 



recruiting students interested in 
tuloring. This is a part-time job which 
pays more than minimum wage. The. 
tutor's weekly scheduled appointments 
will never exceed ten hours. Applicants 
are required to obtain recom- 
mend i nuns from two faculty members, 
like working with people, and feel good 
about the subjeel they want lo leach. 
Anyone interested in working as a 
student tutor particularly in Math, 
Chemistry, Accounting, and Statistics 
is urged to contact ihe office at 481-6817. 

An informative newsletter is 
prepared by the staff from the center. 
This monthly publication offers helpful 
suggestions on note-taking, test-taking, 
and textbook-reading along with 
newsworthy items related to the 
department The newsletters are free 
and available upon request. 

Michael O'Hear came lo IPFW in 
1976 for the sole purpose of trans- 
forming the General Studies Program 
into a learning center lhat was func- 
nonal for the students. The programs 
being offered at Ihe center today 
evolved from his efforts. Students 
working together as a group, in- 
structional reading material excerpted 
from lexlbooks used on campus, and 
students applying their knowledge of 
one new skill while learning another are 
some of the changes that have been 
made in The Learning Center.

Consideration needed 
for visitors on campus 



A couple different issues concerning 
parking at IPFW have arisen in past 
weeks. 

No, it doesn't have to do with the fact 
: that students are type B individuals and 
not very motivated to walk great 
distances to class. It has something to do 
with being considerate of both students' 
and visitors' safety on campus. 

The first issue is one that has already 
been addressed by the Student Senate in 
a resolution. They want the university to 
change Lot 6 by the Helmke Library 
from a 24-hour A lot to AB parking 
between 5:30 p.m. and 7 a.m. Most other 
A lots turn to AB parking after 5 p.m. 
Considering the fact that after 5 p m. the 
ratio of students to faculty is very 
heavily weighted to the student side 
makes the resolution a good idea. 

The first reason for the change might 
simply be to maintain safety around 
IPFW. What student, coming from a 
class in Kettler, Neff, or the Classroom- 
Medical Building, would feel safe 
walking atone to their car at night when 
they have to park clear out in the lots 
bordered by Coliseum and Crescent or 
the lot by the Multipurpose Building? 

A second reason is convenience for 
students who are no longer allowed to 
park in meter parking. Many students 
risk tickets and fines to park in a meter 
or A parking space, just to be close to 
class buildings. 

The second issue to arise concerns 
parking for visitors to IPFW Several 
IPFW faculty and staff have raised 
concerns that some IPFW groups are 
conducting their organizational 
activities off-campus because there is no 
convenient visitor parking available on 
campus Although we have meter 
parking and the university police have a 
policy for guest parking, these do not 
adequately serve the visitors to our 
campus. 

Why should somebody who has been 
invited to a group discussion, seminar, 
or conference at IPFW have to pay at 
meter parking? University police policy 
states that parking reserved for guests is 
available if advance notice is given. 
Usually the space allowed is parking 



spaces in the Multipurpose Building tot. 
Parking in this lot does not eliminate 
the problem. If a campus organization 
wants to sponsor a community-wide 
seminar in Neff Hall or Kettler Hall, the 
seminar or conference would probably 
be conducted in the evening. What 
parking accommodations are offered to 
these people coming to our campus? A 
10- to 15-minute walk from the 
Multipurpose Building to their 
destination — at night. 

If you were a guest would you feel 
properly treated? Probably not. If 
were the sponsor of the activity and 
began receiving complaints about this, 
what would you most likely do? You 
would probably consider moving your 
seminar to a location providing ample 
parking, parking that is close to the site 
of the meeting, a site probably off- 
campus. 

Once you consider this, think about 
what other universities do to 
accommodate guests to their campus. 
They have permanent visitor parking 
made available to guests. 

Does IPFW have the capability to 
offer this? 

Yes, we do, once the lot adjacent to 
Helmke Library is examined more 
closely. The lot is constructed so that it 
could easily be divided into two separate 
lots. We propose that one-half of this lot 
be devoted to guest, non-metered, 
parking. The other section can remain A 
parking from 7:01 a.m. to 5:29 p.m. and 
transfer to AB parking from 5:30 p.m. to 
7 a.m. 

This is only one idea being suggested 
Others include the division of the A 
portion of the lot between Neff and 
Classroom-Medical or the creation of a 
small parking lot between Walb and the 
Library where the circle drive now 
exists. This area is seldom used, with the 
exception of bus passenger pick-ups. 

By making a move, the university 
would be showing a concern for the 
safety and conveniences of its students 
and its visitors. At the same time, IPFW 
would be maintaining a positive image 
in the eyes of community members who 
visit our campus. 




Change must take place 



It seems that several things could be 
done to make the registration process 
easier on students and staff. 

First make registration an ongoing 
process. Instead of everyone applying 
for classes at the same time, conduct 
registration throughout the school year. 
This would cut down on long lines and 
frantic counselors. Students would 
appreciate the more flexible time and be 
encouraged to plan their college career 
well in advance. 

The administration should be more 
aware of what classes the students 
would like to see on the roster. If a better 
selection of classes were offered at 
reasonable times, enrollment may go 
up. Also if a class is required for a 
certain major, that class should be 
offered at least once every semester. 

The class schedule should list who is 
teaching a specific class. Many students 



find an instructor they like and would 
like to take more classes led by this 
professor. Unfortunately the schedule 
does not always list instructors, leaving 
to chance who the student will get 

If a class is in the schedule, the 
administration should be sure they have 
an instructor lined up before it is offered. 
Classes should not be cancelled after the 
schedules are printed and registration 
has begun. This has happened again this 
semester, causing unnecessary 
difficulties for seniors preparing to 
graduate. 

Students and administration should 
not be afraid to point out if they believe 
something is wrong. They should not 
hesitate in making their thoughts and 
suggestions known. Communication 
between students and administration is 
vital if we hope to improve the 
registration process. 



It's time to grow up 



When you act as an adult, you get 
treated as an adult It's too bad several 
students on this campus don't seem to 
realize this. 

Students frequenting Walb Union are 
finding it difficult to sit and relax in the 
second floor lounge due to the 
inconsideration and childlike behavior of 
several students affiliated with a Greek 
fraternity housed in Walb. All the lounge 
furniture has been removed indefinitely 
because of the constant mistreatment it 



received from students on the second 
floor. Complaints were recently 
received that furniture had been moved 
to block access to the Walb elevator. It 

was the final straw. 

Everyone is being punished because a 
few bored students wanted something to 
do. 

If the voices of students on this 
campus are to be taken seriously, then 
those same voices need to behave more 
seriously. Kids ... it's time to grow up! 



Letter to the Editor 



To the Editor: 

In 1055 an American ad- 
venturer by the name of 
William Walker invaded 
Nicaragua with a mercenary 
army and declared himself 
president. He proceeded to 
legalize slavery and lo rule 
over his kingdom for several 
years until tie was over- 
thrown by a joint Central 
American armed force. One 
hundred and thirty-one years 
later, another American 

Hasenfus, is on trial in 
Nicaragua on charges of 
conspiracy to help overthrow 
the Nicaraguan government. 
One would have hoped that 



a century and a quarter of 
civilization would have 
resulted in a collective 
respect tor such principles 
as national sovereignty and 
international law, if not on 
the part ot all individuals, 
then at least on the part of 
our own elected officials. 
Alas, the evolution of 
civilization apparently 
requires more than the mere 
passage of years. 

The Reagan ad- 

ministration now speaks 
openly of its desire to 
overthrow the duly elected 
government of another 
nation. The World Court, in 
ruling that U.S. support of 
the conlras is in violation of 



international law, affirms 
"the fundamental right of 
every Slate to choose and 
implement its own political, 



ecoi 



and 



systems." Judges rrom 
countries allied or friendly 
with the United States voted 
with the Court majority in 
this ruling, including Italy. 

Norway, France, Brazil, 
Argentina, Nigeria and 
India. And now, on Nov. 3, 
the United Nations has 
called upon the United Slates 
to obey international law and 
to comply with the World 
Court order to end support 
for the contras. 
What daes it mean when 



our government discards the 
judgement of the rest of the 
world' 1 When all the polls 
show that a strong majority 
of Americans are opposed to 
U.S. military involvement in 
Central America, does it 
mean lhat the Reagan ad- 
ministration says that such 
intervention is a "possible 



eventual option"' If in- 
ternational law and the will 
of the people no longer count 
as arbiters of our govern- 
ment's actions, then how 
different is this government.

When asked about the 
future, O'Hear said he

sible for instructing classes 
in Algebra (MA 111) and 
Principles of Composition

the funding necessary to 
accomplish this is not 
available. 

O'Hear said around 1980 
the department ran oul of 
funds to pay (or tutors. He 
said the department had 
been inundated with 
requests from students 
needing tutors or wanting 
to be a tutor after the paper 
had publicized their 
financial dilemma on the 
front page Since that lime, 
the department's 
popularity has slowly 
diminished over the years.

Mastodons await tough competition 



By DARREN J. 
WAGGONER 

Sports Editor 

The United Slates 
Basketball Writers 
Association has announced 
the results of its pre-season 
Division II basketball poll 
arid, while defending 
champion Sacred Heart is 
the- runaway choice of the 
writers, several IPFW op- 
ponents are listed among the 
lop 30 picks, including three 
from the Great Lakes Valley 
Conference. 

Leading the way among 
the conference schools is 
Kentucky Wesleyan at 
number five. Southern In- 
diana at 28 and defending 
conference champion Lewis, 
al number 30. 

The Mastodons will also 
have a home-and-home 
series against Wright State 
iMlh) and a road game 
against Ferris Stale 122nd) 
as IPFW will play nine 
games against the schools 
considered to be the best in 
Division 11. 

"My first reaction is that 
the national poll shows what 
kind of league and region in 
which we play," men's 
basketball coach Tim 
Russell said. "This is not a 
one-time situation, it's this 
way year after year. And, if 



Commentary 



our league didn't have such 
strong teams where 
everyone beats up on 
everyone else, we would 
probably see even more In 
the Top 20." 

Russell's second reaction 
is probably that the 
Mastodons have competed 
pretty well against these 
teams since he came to 
IPFW in 198283 His teams 
are 5-1 against Southern In- 
diana, 1-4 against Ferris 
State ond 2-3 against Wright 
Stale. While his learns are 0- 
4 against both Kentucky 
Wesleyan and Lewis, five of 
the eight losses came by a 
total of 12 points 

"1 think this shows that, 
not only are we playing 
against the best in the 
country, but we're com- 
peting very well against 
Ihem," Russell said. "It 
shows that the level of play 
at the IPFW Multipurpose 
Building is, night-in and 
night-out, one of the best in 
the nation in NCAA Division 
II." 

Returning players for 
coach Russell are Jim 
Morlan, Richard Ivy, Bruce 
Erwin, Scott Reed, Charles 
Washington, Eric Wilson.

improve their record and 
chance for a bid to the 
NCAA Division II National 
tournament this week as 
they close out the regular 
season. 

IPFW, 24-1. and ranked 
Hth in NCAA Division II, not 
including a Nov 11 match-up 



with I5th-ranked Wright 
State, will participate in the 
West Point Tournament over 
the weekend. Host Army is 
ranked 19th in the most 
recent NCAA poll and one 
participant, Pace, is a 
Division I school 

"The Army tournament 
may not be quite so critical

us, it's just a matter of us 
doing what we need to." 

Statistically, junior Julie 
Hefty still paces the team 
with 291 kills and 115 blocks. 
Her 27 percent attack per- 
centage is second among the 
regular hitters on the squad. 

Sophomore Joni Smith has 
added 232 kills, while senior 
Judy Yagodinski runs the 
offense and leads the team 
with 859 set assists.

- Lead the Adventure 



By DARREN J. 
WAGGONER 
Sports Editor 
With the college basketball 
season set to begin near the 
end ol Ihe month, many of us 
will, for obvious reasons, 
turn our attention towards 
Ihe Hoosiers and Boiler- 
makers. 



Calloway as the only 
returning starters. In Alford, 
Coach Knight has the most 
fundamentally sound player 
in the game. Calloway 
averaged 13.9 points per 
game and should improve 
with that lough rookie season 
under his belt. Alford is 
currently fourth on lU's all- 



Commentary 



Both teams are expected 
to turn in outstanding 
seasons. The Sporting News 
picks Indiana as the nation's 
top team and Purdue at 
number five in their 
preseason poll

-breaki 



development would likely 
have altered the Hoosiers' 
lop spot. Daryl Thomas, a 
fast-improving senior, was 
kicked off the team for "not 
caring about academics" 
according to Coach Bobby 
Knight Rumor has it that 
Thomas, who averaged 14.5 
points a game, will be 
reinstated. 

The dismissal of Thomas 
leaves gifted all-American 
Steve Alford and Big-Ten 
(reshman of the year, Ricky 



time scoring list and should 
take over the top spot quite 
easily, considering a 20-foot 
three-point shot will be in 
use He already takes over 
half of his shots from that 
distance and longer. 

Knight once again ven- 
tured into the junior college 
ranks and came home with 
two outstanding players in 
Dean Garrett and Keith 
Smart. Garrett, a 6' 10" 
junior, should fit in well at 
center. Smart, also a 
junior, will team with Alford 
to form an experienced 
back court duo. 

A possible surprise for IU 
is Magnus Pelkowski In- 
siders say he has improved 
drastically over the off- 
season. 



Now for Purdue: The 
Boilermakers definitely 
have what it takes to win the 
Big Ten championship. Only 
one starter, point guard 
Mack Gadis, has departed 
from the 22-10 team of last 
season. 

Troy Lewis, a second-team 
all Big Ten selection, brings 
his IB. -I points a game back 
for his junior season. The 
explosive Lewis has the 
potential to be a 30-points-a- 



gam 



He i 



those dynamic lun-lo-watch 
players who, at 6'4", can do 
just aboul anything on the 

Lewis will be backed up by 
another second-team Big- 
Ten selection. Todd Mitchell. 
Mitchell averaged 16,1 points 
a game while leading the 
learn in rebounding and field 
goal percentage. 

Olher returning starters 
include Doug Lee, a 6'5" 
swingman who averaged 9.3 
points a game, and Melvin 
McCanls. McCanls was a 
third-team (reshman All- 
American last season and at 
6'9". 235 pounds should again 
be an intimidating force in 
Ihe middle.
