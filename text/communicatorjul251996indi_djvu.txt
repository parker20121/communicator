Students help 'rock the vote' 



by No) BttkUy 
Managing Editor 



Braving monsoon-like rains, several 
JPFW sludenls worked for many 
hnuis during lasl week's Gravity 
Kills concert ai the Three Rivers Festival 
Beer Teni to register people lo voie in ibe 
upcoming presidential election. 

According to Indiana-Purdue Students' 
Government Association (IPSGA) esti- 
mates. 50 new voters were registered 
Wednesday night, Diana Sir Louis. IPSGA 
senator and tr^ning and development coor- 
dinator for IPSGA. said voter registration 
will be available m Kettler Hall by the bur- 



sar's office. Tbe registration will sian one 
week bcFore classes and continue until 30 
days before llie election in November. 

"I would have liked lo have seen a better 
turnout .. bui I'm not disappointed," Sir 
Louis said. She said she thought the poor 
weather was probably the biggest facior in 
keeping people home 

The student volunteers were recognized 
by 96.3 'The Edge" for their professional- 
ism. Sir Louis said. Sir Louis said she 
wanted to show her appreciation for Betty 
Butler, senatorial representative, and Sarah 
Strom, student orientation activities repre- 
sentative (SOAR) Both Strom and Butler 
were loo young to be admitted to the tent 
and stayed outside in the rain recruiting 



potential voters 

Sir Louis also said she wanted lo show 
appreciation lo David Fitch, David Burgess, 
and Doug Rheinheimcr for their involve- 
ment. 

IPSGA sponsored the voter drive along 
with "The Edge" and "Rock the Vote." 
"Rock the Vote" was created by several 
musical acts to educate and register ihe 
younger generation about the importance of 
voting. Historically, the 18 to 24 age group 
has had a dismal turnout Lasi election. 
only 14,079 people in that age group voted, 
according to figures compiled by Ihe Allen 
County Voter Registration Board. 

Sir Louis also said she was working with 
Youthvote 96 and thai group will he send- 



ing literature lo younger voters. This litera- 
ture will list reasons younger people should 
vote, according lo Sir Louis, 

The turnout was less than expected 
according to IPSGA President George 
Gounaris. He cited Ihe postponemeni of 
The Smashing Pumpkins/Garbage concen 
as another factor for the low turnout. The 
members of Garbage were scheduled to 
help register voters until the heroin over- 
dose death by a suppwting member of The 
Smashing Pumpkins and the arrusi of the 
now-former Smashing Pumpkin drummer. 
The volunteers also dealt with enormous 
rainfall and a lomado waich on Wednesday 
night. 

"If we registered one (person) il was 



successful because one is betier than none," 
Gounaris said. 

Gounaris also said IPSGA was one of 
the few groups which did not back out of its 
commiimeni to help "The Edge." 

IPSGA Senator Gina Burgess said many 
corporate entities decided not to sponsor 
some booths after the postponement of The 
Smashing Pumpkins concert. Burgess also 
said "The Edge" will be showcasing several 
bands in a campus concen on Sepl. 27. 

"I would like lo thank all the volunteers, 
those able to work under the tent and those 
who were unable lo because of iheir age." 
Burgess said.

Pepsi Cola, Aramark 
win five-year contracts 



by Paul Tupp«r 

Those who use caffeine to make it 
through the day can rejoice. Mountain Dew 
IS back on campus and is here for a five- 
year siay, 

Pepsi Cola prod- 
ucts have won a five- 
year contract with 
IPFW for exclusive 
^ ~ *^^ beverage rights. The 
^L \^^^H contract took effect 
^^k l^^l July 1 and will expire 
^^ I ^H June 30, 2001 
^^*-*-^^' According to 

Walter Branson, vice 
chancellor of fmancial 
an'airs. the decision to 
switch to Pepsi from Coke was a fmancial 
decision. 

"Pepsi put together a better package than 
Coke," said Branson. 'They offered finan- 
cial incentives," 

Those incentives include on campus pro- 
motions and distribution of IPFW advertis- 



Watter 
Branson 



ing in Northeast Indiana in ca.ses of soda. 

Dave Leeka, director of purchasing. 
describes the process that led the adminis- 
tration to its decision. "When Coke was 
awarded a .shorl-ierm contract, it was decid- 
ed IPFW should allow each company equal 
opportunities. So each was sent a request 
for proposals," 

La.sl semester when the Pepsi (specifical- 
ly Mountain Dew) products were replaced 
with the Coke products many students com- 
plained their staple for survival was 
stripped away without properly surveying 
student opinions. However, Branson said 
the opposite was also the case, 

"When we went to Coke we got a lot of 
ihank-you calls from students and faculty 
who prefer Diet Coke to Diet Pepsi, So we 
are expecting a few calls of complaint form 
those who'll miss Diet Coke," said 
Branson, 

George Gonauris, president of the student 
body, likes the return of Pepsi, but feels a 
more compromising solution could have 
been found. "As large as Ibis campus is. 
why can't wc house boih? Why is an 



exclusive contract needed?" asked 
Gonauris. 

Also winning a five-year contract is 
Aramark, a food distribution company that 
will manage the cafeteria in Walb 
Memorial Union, operate Ihe vending 
machines throughout c^npus and set-up a 
deli-style food car in the basement of 
KeiUer Hall. 

Branson believes Aramark will satisfy 
many students. "We got good reviews 
from Aramark and il has a suong presence 
in Fort Wayne," Branson said 

Erin Fridh, programming director of stu- 
dent activities, is alsooplimLstic, "The food 
was excellent." said Fridh, "Aramark 
sounded like they wanted people to know 
they are here to serve the campus," 

Many students complained about the 
quality and price of the food that was 
served at Eurest, the company that man- 
aged the Wdb cafeteria for many years. 

Prices in the new cafeteria are expected 
to stay about the same 2s previous years. 
but more choices are being added, includ- 
ing Healthy Choice Brand products.

Numerous people try balancing their 
family life with their careers, but few have 
dared to try maintaining a successful full- 
time occupation and run for congressional 
office. Yet, Jerry Houseman, professor of 
political science has taken the challenge. 
Through his hard work, the Fourih District 
Congressional Democratic candidate has 
made quite a name for himself 

The last week of June. Houseman's cam- 
paign led him to the While House. Along 
with several other congressional candidates. 
he was able to shake the hands of President 
Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, 

"He was a very confident man. very con- 
fident about the upcoming elections," said 
Houseman, speaking of the president. "He 
was a Jolly man." 

The purpose of the event was to allow 
candidates to receive some publicity to add 
to their campaigns. Video tapes were pro- 
duced. Photos were taken, with the smiling 
face of the president on each piece of film. 

According to Houseman, Gore greeted 
him at the door to the Oval Office and said, 
"I am expecting you to gel revenge for my 
fellow Tenncsseeans." referring lo a siaie- 
ment by Rep Mark Souder about incesi and 
molestation practices in Kentucky and 
Tennessee, 

"He look more time with me than the 
other candidates," said Houseman. "He 
wanted to talk about Souder " Souder cur- 
rently holds Houseman's desired seal. 

The president also showed his sense of 
humor. Houseman said he congratulated 
him on having one of Ihe "weakest and 
most vulnerable" opponents found any- 
where in the nation. 



Clinton has managed to lead Dob Dole, 
the Republican presidential candidate, in 
some recent polls taken in Indiana by 
Houseman Although Houseman is less 
publicized than Souder. he has been moving 
up in Ihe polls as well. 

In addition, Houseman said a recent 
national Gallop poll revealed that the cur- 
rent Republican-controlled Congress is the 
most unpopular in history, with a 19 percent 
approval and a 71 percent disapproval rat- 
ing. 

Houseman's campaign is built upon 
three distinct views: higher education, 
employment opportunities and technology. 

He is a strong supporter of higher educa- 
tion. He disapproves of anything that cuts 
back on the process of receiving a defmed 
education. He refuses to support the cut 
back of educational funding. He strongly 
opposes such bills as lowering the spending 
on technology, the firing of teachers and 
cutting the lunch programs within an educa- 
tional facility. Furthermore, be is working 
to organize betier higher education loans. 

Houseman also works in a efforl to 
strengthen the job force. His plan is to con- 
tinue trade with Japan, Mexico and other 
surrounding countries. He wants to set up a 
firm training program. 

His third view concerns research and 
technology. He encourages businesses lo 
continue lo expand, upgrade technology 
and not to maintain ihings as they always 
have been. 

"Corporations have neglected this in 
recent." said Houseman. 

Houseman manages to separate his lime 
as a professor and candidate. He taught 
classes during the Summer 1 session. For 
the rest of the summer however, he plans lo 
promote his campaign.

acter a menace lo society.

man wilii silver hair and mustache, 
looking and smelline like a corpse 
Sound familiar? How about the 
increased need and desire lo Teed 



upon innocent victims to

the Dracula of the movie scene, thai 
IS not what should be expected of 
die Purdue-Indiana Theatre's pro- 
duction of 'Dracula.'

nal script written in 1927 which

Indiana Theatre staff Rying bats, 
secitl entrances, sudden disappear- 
ances, trap doors and naming cross- 
es will catch any unsuspecting 
viewer as amazing. Music for the

taining old honor film music.

Movie Review: 'I Shot Andy Warhol' 



by Paul Tupper 
Editor 

1 have always thought Andy 
Warhol was a boring person. My 
perception comes from various 
biographies of die late artist. The 
new film, "1 Shot Andy Warhol" 
solidifies my perception. 

But don't let my personal opin- 
ions of him sway you from se«mg 
this movie, for it is far less than 
boring. Warhol sdll comes off as 
tedious, but the center of the movie 
is Valerie Solanis. an early-day les- 
bian feminist who wants to change 
the world by making men obsolete 
A college graduate of psychology, 
sbe uses prostitution to feed herself 
and bounces from room to room for 
shelter. 

She pens a manifesto called 
"SCUM" (Society for Cutting Up 



Men), which she tries to push on 
every unsuspecting woman passing 
by her A drag queen acquaintance. 
Candy I&gt;arling, introduces Valerie 
to Warhol's office. The Factory. 
where she soon stalks to get the 
chance to speak to him. When she 
fmaJly meets Andy, she insists he

from "SFW," never looks like a

The movie is factually based. 
Language, drugs and nudity are 
used as a backdrop to describe an 
era and a clique, giving a semblance 
of reality. The film doesn't last loo

entertaining. The performances and

than can be said about any of Andy

mo-^nm of I'lfo 



by Jennifer Sons 
Features Editor 

Is there reason and explanalion 
for (he day-lo-day coincidences ihai 
occur in cacta and everyone's daily 
lives? There is nol a single person 
thai has al one point in lime ques- 
tioned what and why things happen 
lo (hem as ibey do. "What did 1 do 
10 deserve this?" or "Why is this 
happening lo me?" are iwo ques- 
tions spoken millions of times a 
day. We battle with our thoughts, 
dreams and actions (and many 
other things) and attempt to make 
sense of ii all 

James Redficld. author of "The 
Cclestine Prophecy," just may have 
stumbled upon an answer lo our 
puzzling questions In his book. 
RedHcId takes the reader through 
his journey of Peru and his discov- 
ay of a manuscript — full of insight 
into the here-and-now. 

The reader is taken through the 
Andes Mountains as if they were 
indeed there themselves. 
RedHeld's descriptions of ancient 
niins and mountainside forests give 
a new and exciting beauty to what 
may appear to be less than glam- 
orous at Tirsl sight 

While traveling the terrain, 
Redrield takes the reader through 
bis discovery of a manuscript thai 
has been abolished by the Pcnivian 
Govenuneni Within the first few 
pages, ihe beginning of this docu- 
ment unfolds "The Firsl Insight." 
In each of our Lvcs occur mysteri- 
ous coincidences — sudden, syn- 
chronistic events that, once inier- 
prelcd. lead us into our true desdny. 

When this book was Hrst pub- 
lished, few people had heard of the 




disappearance, or even existence, of 
this ancient Peruvian manuscript. 
In it. Ihe nine insights that the 
human race needs to grasp in order 
to perceive a true era of spiritual 
awareness, are explained — each 
insight leading into the next This 
document has been suppressed by 
the government qui of fear — a fear 
of the meaning of our existence and 
an interpretation of the term "com- 
mon sense." 

This book does nol attempt to 
overturn science or religion In 
fact, it supports a combination of 
the two. It explains the question 
"Why?" Why has our world pro- 
gressed to where il is. through tech- 
nology and spiiiu and the unimag- 
inable question, where are we going 
to now? 

Once the reader finds and under- 
stands how the nine insights fit in 
the individual's life, a new and 
exciting perspective on the human 
life and all its sunoundings will be 
gained. A positive approach lo life 
and an intensified vision of beauty 
wiU give any reader reason to keep 
luming the pages of the book. "The 
Celestine Prophecy," and gain 
insight on the meaning of life.

Gays moving forward 




I read in a recent USA Totiay, 
which often publishes gay- posi- 
tive anicles, a story that basi- 
cally said this was a bad lime for 
gays. As much as I like USA Today 
(it's so pretty). I have to disagree. 

I understand why the newspaper 
would say such a thing. The gay 
life is taking a heavy beating by 
those who don't support gay mar- 
riages. Even our friend F*resident 
Chnton has seemed lo turn his back 
on us. But if you look around. 1996 
is a great year for gays. 

Let's Stan locally and work our 
way out. Fort Wayne is slowly, but 
surely, opening its closet doors for 
its gay citizens. We currendy have 
three- and- a-half gay bars. (Henry's 



has a big gay 
following, but 
the jury still 
hasn't decided 
ty. if it's a gay 

■* ^PP^^ bar,)Nomauer 

what your 
atmosphere of 
choice, 
chances are we 
have a bar to 
suit your 

needs, 

Wc also 
have a growing 
commitment to gay civil rights, 
with IPFWs own United 
Sexualiiies, the reformation of 
FAIR, the Up-Tbe-Siairs 
Community Center and Indiana 
Youth Group, just to name a few. If 
gay activism isn't your game, try 
gay volleyball or gay bowling. 
There really is more to do than 
watch screaming radicals going off 
on ministers on "Ricki Lake " 

In the tri-siaie area, gays can 
choose from gay days at most 
amusement pailu. an exhibiu and 
theater productions, which feature 
gay talents, to the growing number 
of movies chronicling gay lives. If 
those movies aren't here, chances 



we they are nearby. 

Nationally, being gay is becom- 
ing more accepted. Although the 
nation as a whole doesn't seem lo 
want gays to mairy, most of the 
polls I've seen suggest America 
doesn't mind 



her gay patriots. 
Sure, we have 
representatives 
like Newt 
Gingrich and 
Sonny Bono 
who have gay 
family members 
but still irefuse 
to support them, 
but that doesn't 
seem to be the 
typical 
American 
response. 

And there 
are more and 
more activities, 
nationwide, that 
ate gay friendly. 
Just off the top 
my head, 

there's Aspen 
Gay Ski Week. 
Gay Week ai Club Med in Cancun have ways 



Nationally, being gay 

IS becoming more 
accepted. Although 
the nation as a whole 

doesn't SEEM TO WANT 
GAYS TO MARRY, MOST 
OF THE POLLS I'VE SEEN 

SUGGEST America 

DOESN'T MIND HER GAY 
PATRIOTS. 



happen in most every major clly 
(except Fort Wayne - we have to 
work on that). The world is for 
gays to clutch the pearl of the oys- 
ter. 

This year was also the year we 
saw the first 

gay-positive 

judgment from 
Ibe Supreme 
Court. I expect 
more of that lo 
follow, espe- 
cially when the 
high court is 
asked to decide 
on the House's 
recent decision 
to allow states 
to not recog- 
nize gay mar- 
riages by 
another state. It 
should only be 
a matter of time 
before that is 
ruled unconsti- 
tutional. 

ByaUttf 
this, I'm not 
saying we don' I 



go. but isn't it nice u&gt; 
and the gay pride festivals which be here radier than back there?

Following an inter-office memo 
that stated she would not simply 
disappear. Marge Schott has been 
banned from Riverfront Stadium 
until further notice. 

National League president 
Leonard Coleman informed the 
club and Schott of the action last 
week amid concern that Schott was 
involving herself in day-to-day 
operations of the team. An earlier 
agreement between the league and 
Schott strictly forbids her involve- 




ment in any learn operations 

The action, which went inio 
effect Monday, will not be canceled 
until Schott finds a replacement

is banned from the former luxury 
suite and her usual front-row scat at

Rhinos admirable in opener 



by Jim Porter 
Sports Editor 

The River Ciiy Rhinos 
opened iheii inaugural season in 
Fort Wayne to a home crowd of 
over 2,700 fans. The attendance 
figure was well below 3.500- 
5,000 spectators team manage- 
ment hoped lo attract, but it is 
doubtful many more fans could 
have gotten into Zollner 
Stadium before the kickoff any- 
way. 

Ten minutes prior to (he 
beginning of the game, fans 
were still lined up for almost a 
full city block trying to gel into 
ibe game. Apparently a mad 
rush for gate sale tickets was 
more than team management 
expected. 

Once inside the stadium, fans 



were treated to everything from 
free t-sbin giveaways, to a band 
that bad set up just in front of the 



RIVER CITY 




RHIMOS 



bleachers. Apparently Ihe band's 
name was Rhino and they claimed 



lo have a playlist of nothing but 
football related tunes. How the 
song "Lump" by The Presidents 
of the United States relates to 
football is queslionable, but it is 
ihc song that was heard the loud- 
est. There was also a psuedo- 
dance troup called the 
"Rhinestones." Oh and yes there 
was a football game. 

Although the final score, 24-14 
in favor of ihe Racine Raiders, 
was less than favorable for play- 
ers and fans alike, the team and 
its new fans should not be disap- 
pointed. The Raiden are defend- 
ing league champions and have 
won that title four of the last six 
seasons. A valiant effort by the 
up-slan Rhinos showed die River 
City what to expect this summer 
as a new semi-professional foot- 
ball team invades the Fori.

Golf proves less than boring 





0^ 


p Jim 




C ' . 


Porter 




tA 





The game of goif has been sail) 
to be a good walk ruined. For those 
who subscribe lo thai theory it is 
obvious ihcy have never nailed a 
sand wedge from Ihe bunker on the 
18lh green. For others who have 
merely Flipped past Ihe weekly 
rounds on television, I offer the fol- 
lowing reasons why golf is not the 
most boring programming on lele- 



1. There are no strikes or expired 
bargaining agreements in golf. No 
loud-mouthed youngsters try to 
crash the pany and demand notabil- 
ity without having even stepped 



foot on the 
course. Golf 
is a game 
that demands 
a player 
proves him- 
self before 
commanding 
respect and 
there are no 
golfers 
threatening 
not 10 play if 
they don't 



money they think they deserve. 

2. No mascots. Is there any more 
that needs to be said? Baseball, 
football, basketball and almost 
every other sporting event seems lo 
have some son of animated charac- 
ter running and leaping about 
detracting spctialors' attention 
from the game. Golf has some how 
avoided a]l of ij]at nonsense, thank- 
fully. 

3. Bellies. Either beer tumors or 
"Dunloped disease," stomach pro- 
Irudances are common place 
whether on Ihe professional circuii 



or at the local links. The nice thing 
is that anyone who has one can still 
golf rather successfully and still be 
quite happy with his performance. 
Craig Stadler is probably the poster 
child for this group of duffers and 
an honorable one loo. 

4. Golf clothes. Sure Ihey were 
gaudy and almost grotesque in the 
seventies and early eighties. Funny 
thing is now sporting goods compa- 
nies have gotten involved and 
golfers are starling to promote the 
threads they wear for big bucks. 
They aren't cheap either, A decent 
golf outnt at your local pro shop 
could run you upwards of S150 lo 
$200 easy. No longer are dad's old 
checker print pants and a butterfly 
collar shin proper protocol. 

5. There is no trash talking on Ihe 
course. Oh maybe occasionally a 
couple of buddies out for Ihe week- 
end might wager a few bucks on a 
round of golf or a particular hole, 
but you'll never hear Nick Faldo 
talking aboui Ernie Els momma, 

«. A respect for the rules. Golf is 
probably the only spon where there 



is still an undying devotion lo the 
game that was invented when 
Moses was a kid. At least it seems 
the game of golf is thai old. You 
won'! see anyone, except maybe 
Chevy Chase in "Caddy Shack" 
booting his ball loward the cup or 
talking above a whisper while his 
opponent pulls. 

So there you have it. There may 
be only six rules for why golf isn't 
the most boring spon on television. 
They are Ihe most important six 
reasons to the argument. While 
there are inherent problems wiih the 
game of golf, it's too slow for one 
thing, at least it is more interesting 
than watching "Dream Team III" 
uample every team ihat stands in its 
path toward another gold medal. 

Take it as you will. After all. Ihe 
view from under Ihe bleachers has 
always been somewhat like a beau- 
ty in Ihe eye of the beholder. It's ail 
an opinion, I thank everyone who 
has read the offerings in this space 
over the last 10 or 11 months. Like 
they saw though, all good things 
must come to an end and 
well,...That's all folks! 



Free agent frenzy infects NBA 



by Jim Porter 
Sports Editor 

The almighty dollar has run 
amuck in the National Basketball 
Association. In a season of free 
agency like none before, playem are 
gobbling up all of the dollar signs 
team owners can toss before them 
and then some. Nearly SI billion, 
yes ihat is Billion, has been spent 
by NBA leams on player contracts. 
There are hefty sums being dolled 
out to big names such as Michael 
Jordan and Shaquille O'Neal as 
well as to no-name players such as 
I&gt;on Mac Lean. 

After Jordan agreed to a one- 
year, S25 million deal wilh Ihe 
Bulls, the ink and money started 
flying. The Lakers lured "Shaq" to 
Hollywood with a seven -year, 
S120 million deal. According to 
many insiders, the deal was done 
long before the announcement was 
reached despite obvious tampering 
on the pan of Lakers from office 
guru Jerry West. Miami re-signed 



Alonzo Mourning lo a multi-year 
deal worth SI 12 million. 

The Heal showed Ihey ai least 
have a lol of cash lying around if 
nothing else. Along with the S112 
million spent on Mourning, the 
team signed Juwan Howard to a 
seven-year, S98 million contract 
and threw S36 million over seven 
years to PJ, Brown (who?). Three 
players for nearly S250 million. 

Other big money coniracis 
include Ihe S56 million the Knick 
will pay Allan Houston over the 
next seven seasons. New York will 
also pay Chris Childs an eslunated 
S4 million in each of ihe next six 
years In Orlando the Magic 
soothed the wounds of losing 
O'Neal by giving Horace Grant a 5- 
year. S50 million deal. 

Gary Paylon will slay in Seattle 
after the Sonics agreed lo pay him 
S88 million over the next five years 
and Tracy Murray goi a contract 
worth S19 million for seven years, 
Philadelphia made a slight effort to 
improve their dismal ranking in the 



league by signing Don MacLean 
(no not the "American Pie" guy) lo 
a SI 5 million five-year deal. 

In Indiana, the Pacers solidified 
their squad by agreeing to terms 
wilh a pair of guys named Davis. 
Antonio Davis got a seven-year, 
S38,5 million deal while Dale Davis 
signed for S42 milhon over the nexi 
seven seasons. 

The Rockets extended the con- 
tract of all-star Hakeem Olajuwon 
for five years and S60 million, 
Houston also inked a deal wilh 
Brent Price for seven years and S18 
million. Just down the road in 
Dalls, Ihe Mavericks agreed to 
terms with Chris Galling, He will 
make S22 million during a five-year 
coniraci. 

Possibly the biggesl surprise 
however was the irade of Dikembe 
Mulombo to Atlanta. Mutombo will 



make S50 million over the next five 
years while playing for the Hawks, 

Other big-name trades include 
Larry Johnson being unloaded to 
New York for Brad Lohaus and 
Anthony Mason, The Pacers also 
made a big trade by trading Ricky 
Pierce and Mark Jackson for Jalen 
Rose and Reggie Williams. 

Yes. money talks and suckers 
walk in Ihe NBA and team owners 
have shown they are not afraid to 
pass Ihe bucks for the player or 
players they covet.

results and a running medal count. 
Having wasted various amounts of 
time in search of the best in 
Olympic news from the net, die fol- 
lowing homepage addresses are

Olympic Committee itself. The 
AOC homepage can be found at 
http://atlanla.olympics.org. With a 
searchable index of every athlete, 
there are 10,700 athletes competing 
in these summer games, to a 
detailed summary of each competi- 
tion, the Official homepage of the 
XXVI Olympiad is by tar the best 
on the web. 

Also loaded with information is 
a locale designated as America's 
Sports Headquarters. Located at 
hllp://www.sport- 
hq.com/spori/olympics, hi ml, Ihe 
ASHq is a net surfers heaven full 
of information on Allania, news 
and chat groups concerning Ihe 
Olympics, daily repons on results 
and a sizable index of other 
Olympics related homepages. This 
one is defmllely worth a look. 



Ai hltp://www.mindspring- 

com/'?c7Eprog400/olympics/ailanla, 
html you can find everything from 
a m^ of Ihe city of Atlanta, to the 
homepages of just about every cor- 
porate sponsor involved wilh the 
games. Homepages for Coca-Cola. 
AT&amp;T, IBM and Xerox are only a 
few of those hsted. There is also a 
quick users guide to ihe Olympics 
and detailed summaries of the com- 
petition. 

So the next lime you are won- 
dering whether or not the women's 
yachting team defeated Yugoslavia 
in the latest off shore event, simply 
log on at Ihe nearest terminal and 
happy surfing.
