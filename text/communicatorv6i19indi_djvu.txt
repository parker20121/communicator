3 The Communicator T 



Cultural program 



No year would be complete without a request for student activity funds t.y the 
Black Student Union. The annua! request is usually to sponsor a black history week 
or a black awareness week or something along these lines. The request has been 
made again this year. 

There are two issues that must be dealt with in this kind nf mi ii.-itpnn Thcfirsl is 
whether or not the BSU should be allocated student body money The second is 
whether a cultural awareness program is a wise expenditure of student money. 
The issues are mutually exclusive but they are not generally discussed that 



i submitted for Student Senate approval reaffirms that fact. In this 
regard the BSU has no right or even privilege to money from the student body Nor 
does any other similar organization. It is not likely that the majority of students are 
happy to pay mandatory fees to support closed membership, special interest 
groups. 

On the other hand, and this is a completely separate issue, a cultural 
s program sounds like a good idea to spend the money on. Such a program 



a budget to finance such a program and would welcome l.he opportunity to do so. 
Past history shows this to be true. 

Convo's control of the program would insure that the program would lake into 
account the cultural differences evident in the entire student body, not Juat a 
minority of 2.5 percent. It could maximize the {ippe.il and oducal tonal experience 
such a program would offer Audit would not si-t a danr.O'niu.s allocation precedent. 

Planning should begin now so that the program can be put on next year. Access 
to the program should be open to all cultural, social and philosophical groups on 
campus, not just to "chic" minorities. The program should be streamlined and well 
produced, so that it does not drag on forever at low interest levels like past 
programs have And time and money should not be monopolized by any one group. 

This approach will obtain the cultural program without going the route of 
irrational allocation of the students' money.
