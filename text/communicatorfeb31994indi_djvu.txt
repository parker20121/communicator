Black History Month recognized 



Mary McLeod Bethune 
1875-1955 

Mary McLeod Bethune devoted her life to 
bringing dignity, opportunity and hope to 
Black Americans. She became a teacher, the 
builder of a school, a public speaker and a 
governmental administrator. 

Mrs. Bethune started a school for girls in the 
Daytona Beach, Florida, area with only $1.50 
in her pocket. She earned money for this 
school over the years by doing many different 
jobs. In 1923, the Bethune School joined with 
the Cookman Institute, to become the 
Belhune-Cookman College. 

President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed 
Mrs. Bethune to serve as the Director of the 
Negro Affairs Division of the National Youth 
Administration. Both President and Mrs. 
Roosevelt were great admirers of Mary 
McLeod Bethune. She was given the Sprigam 
Medal for Negro achievement in the year 
1935. 




VV.E.B. DuBois 
1868-1963 

William DuBois was a brilliant student at 
school and had hoped to study at Harvard 
College. However, his parents died before his 
high school graduation; and so, he had to go 
to work. A local minister arranged for a schol- 
arship to Fisk University, in Tennessee. 

Soon after his graduation from Fisk, DuBois 
won a scholarship to Harvard. He became the 
first Black to win a PhD from Harvard. From 
there he went to the University of Berlin, 
where he studied sociology and economics. 
His writings on Black history are model stud- 
ies even today. 

DuBois did not believ.e that economic 
opportunity alone would solve the problems 
of Black Americans. Therefore, he was one of 
the founders of the N.A.A.CP. 

Best known of his writings are "The Souls 
of Black Fold," "Black Folk Then and Now" 
and "Encyclopedia of the Negro." 




Students and faculty question 
Vice President's actions 



by Ramona Mcgown 
Editor Jn chief 

As the deadline for the Student 
Body President Rajat Sun is 
quickly approaching, Jerry 
Richardson, vice president of leg- 
islation, has apparenUy moved into 
the president's office. 

Mike Hcii, vice president of 
financial affairs, said thai he "was 
aware dial Jerry had already gone 
inlo Sun's office." 

Yet, Heil was nol aware of the 
fact that Suri's name had been 
removed from the board outside of 
the Indiana-Purdue Government 
Association office. 

"I thought it was highly prema- 
ture to make that type of a change, 
when we have given the President 
Sun Friday at 5 p.m. as his dead- 
line, "said Chris Douse, student 
senator and co-chairman of 
IPSGA's Legislative Affairs 
Committee. "I question whether 
Suri has a deadline or not." 

Marian Zimmerman, adviser to 
IPSGA and dean of students, said

I Suri's did as of 



that she had spoken with Rajat and unable to return at this time, then 

they had agreed that he would Suri would either fax or call her 

come back by Friday afternoon. with his resignation. "Until Rajal 

Zimmerman also states, if Suri is has officially resigned in writing. 



he is Mill the student body govern- 
ment president," said Zimmerman. 
"As far as Jerry moving into the 
office, I assume that it really will 
not make a difference because he 
will probably become the presi- 
dent; but, the issue is was that a 
appropriate thing to do and I think 
the students are saying probably 
not." said Zimmerman. 

Some students have been ques- 
tioning whether or not Rajat's 
appointments on the budget com- 
mittee will still be upheld by 
Richardson. 

Zirnmerman believes that Suri's 
appointments are still valid and 
should be addressed by the IPSGA 
Legislative Branch. 

"In my mind those appointments 
were made during Christmas break 
and should be upheld. If he had 
made those appointments after 
classes had started then Jerry 
could make new appointments if 
he chose to do so," said 
Zimmerman. 



Phase One 

Testing underway on new ventilation system 



by Jo Ann Stein forth 
News Editor 

Testing continues on die new air 
handler in Classroom Medical as 
initially reported in last week's 
issue of the Communicator. 

According to Donald R. Katter. 
director of the Physical Plant, Phase 
One of the new air handler is still in 
the testing phase. All the completed 
work happened inside the AGC-i 
air handler. 

"The unit needs to be balanced 
and more testing needs to be ran," 
said Katter. 

"Testing on Phase One may con- 
tinue until the end of February." 
added Kaiier. 

The ventilation section consists of 
four components; a return and fresh 
air section, the filtering section, 
cooling coil section, and tile supply 
air. which drives air out into the 
building. 

In the filtering section, a mini- 
mum of fresh air has lo be intro-

duced from the outside at all times. ing system in the filtering section 

With the help of larger motors on and new and larger cooling coils in 

tile return air supply fan, Phase One the cooling section. The old cooling 

will provide a more efficient filler- coils were not large enough to 



accommodate tile air volume. The 
return air section brings air back 
from within the building. 

"The new motors in Phase One, 
especially in the return air and sup- 
ply air fan are much more effi- 
cient," said Katter. 

The quick fixes dial did not work: 
Katter explained that in the past, air 
only came into a room thai needed 
to be cooled. The old unit did not 
have a heat source. Bigger pipes 
were used to lead into a small vent. 
This will be corrected in Phase 
Three. 

"We had put a cbeater (a regula- 
tor) which would in effect, indicate 
this box is closed so the air would 
always be turned off. We fooled the 
thermostat," said Katter. 

Initially this was done with a few 
rooms, but now has been done in all 
the rooms. There is still a small 
leak. 

"We know what tile problems are 
now and are addressing them," 
explained Katter. 



IPSGA 

Acting President 
works out details 



by Linda Oliver 
Chief Reporter 

On Monday Jerry Richardson, 
student body vice president of 
legislation, announced that he 
would serve as acting student 
body prcsidenL 

"We talked with Student Body 
Government President, Rajat 
Suri, within the past 12 hours 
and we worked out some details 
of his return. In the mean lime I 
will serve in his position and 
Mark King, co-chair of internal 
affairs, will act as chairperson," 
said Richardson. 

Richardson said that he hopes 
the remaining details get 
resolved and Suri returns before 
Friday. 

Dean of Students and Advisor 
to IPSGA, Marian Zimmerman, 
said she heard many different 
stories on tile subject of whether 
Suri will return. So the faculty 
decided lo extend the deadline to 
Friday. 

David Leeka, director of pur- 
chasing, attended the meeting 
with Chief of Police Lauren 
Denhartog to answer questions 
about die Parking Fee Proposal. 

The full time students' parking 
permit increase (SI per credit 
hour course) rate was based on 
the $80,000 to S90.000 cost to 
add two parking garages and 



parking lots maintenance and on 
Lbe fact that 96% of the '93 year 
students purchased parking per- 
mits, admitted Denhartog. 

When Chris Douse. IPSGA 
senator, asked if there was a cap 
on the parking proposal, Leeka 
answered no and supposed it was 
so because there are not any of 
Lbe other university fees. 

"Past students paid for today's 
student's parking facilities and 
buildings, so now the tables have 
turned. That is just how it 
works." said Zimmerman. 

Charles Copeland, co-chairman 
of internal affairs, argued the 
unfairness of die students having 
to bear the burdens of increases. 

He felt the increase of books, 
student fees, tuition, and now 
parking were becoming a bit too 
much. He wondered what the 
students could do to limit the 
increases. 

Leeka explained that he was 
filling in for Walter Branson, 
vice chancellor of financial 
affairs, was unable to attend tile 
meeting. 

Any questions or recommenda- 
tions should be directed to 
Branson said Leeka. Jeffery 
Valdez was introduced as the 
new senate member.

STAFF EDITORIAL 

Traditional 
values challenged 

"To torrtet so many generations of bad faith and cruelty . . . you 
will meet the mast fantastic, the most brutal, and the most 
determined resistance. " 

James Baldwin 



There are three privileged groups in the United Slates of America' 
whites, heterosexuals, and males. 

The issues of race relations, homosexuality, and sexual harassment 
continue lo ignite emotional conversations throughout the nation. 

In the Sept. 26 issue of (he Journal Gazelle, a story was printed about 
a minister being offended by a sweatshirt hanging in (he window of a 
beauty salon beneath his church. 

Whal's the big deal? 

Along wiih rclevanl scriptures from the Bible, a picture or a Black 
Jesus is airbrushed on the front of the sweatshirt. This concept of Jesus 
being a man of African descent offended the minister whom the 
Gametic did not hesitate to point out was white. 

This "offensive" display possesses several questions that religious 
figures and socieiy must look at and answer in order for our young girls 
and boys ". . . to learn what the Bible says accurately," according to 
the disgruntled minister. 

If one examines the Bible, he or she will find explicit references to 
Jesus being a despised man of color, not specifically of African 
descent, but a man of color. Jews throughout history have been perse- 
cuted, enslaved, and invaded. Docs this sound familiar to the African- 
American experience? 

Jesus describes himself as a "despised" and "rejected" of men in 
Isaiah 53. 

How can a man of the cloth determine what is an accurate portrayal 
or Jesus if the scriptures strongly suggest that he may belong to people 
of color? 

If he has studied his own Bible, is this scripture omitted? Or is this 
part overlooked? 

Is he despising the same man who died for the sins of everyone, 
including white and black? 

What aspect of the "Black Jesus" is the minister really objecting to? 

Perhaps it is not the portrayal of a Christ of color, but the challenge 
it presents to the Christian institution. 

It's getting lo be a familiar story. 

Let's lake parenting for instance. 

Same-sex couples who want to adopt children are met with the same 
senseless, obstinate thinking that characterizes the minister's opposi- 
tion to the "Black Jesus." 

The notion of two lesbians adopting, raising, and loving a healthy 
child challenges the institution in the same way that the notion of a 
"Black Jesus" expands the scope of Christianity. 

Why? Because homosexuality is not politically correct. 

Why the mere thought of two women raising and exposing a child 
to this "different" lifestyle is unimaginable. 

However, consider this. Most gay men and lesbians are bora from 
heterosexual families. Now if a man and a woman cannot prevent a 
child from being homosexual, how can iwo women or Iwo men stop a 
child from being heterosexual or homosexual? 

So, who has the best values, homosexuals or heterosexuals? 

That would be different, though. That child would be "rebelling" 
against the norm. 

It comes down to (his, if two people, gender withstanding, love each 
other and can provide a child with a home, they should be allowed to 
raise children. 

Sexual orientation should not be considered in determining what 
type of person is Tit to parent a child. 

In either case, whether we are talking about a "Black Jesus" or same- 
sex parents, who is hurt? Certainly not those who challenge the institu- 
tion; they have everything to gain or they would have not challenged 
the institution in Ihe first place. So, it seems the only party injured is 
Ihe institution itself. 

There are other American institutions that are right now in the throes 
of growing pains. 

Anita Hill, for example, in the recent Thomas/HUl Senate hearings, 
sent the institutions of government, education, and business reeling. No 
matter what the reader thinks about Anita Hill, no one can possibly 
deny the positive influence she has had on our socieiy. For example: 
She was the female underdog ihat challenged 'the Good Ol' Boys 
Club." She made women realize they do not have to put up with men 
sexually harassing them in the workplace. Her stance has made men 
aware that patting women on behind or other kinds of inappropnale 
behavior is a crime. 

Anila Hill was the catalyst in making women aware of looking at Ihe 
issues of women in a straight forward manner. 

Hill suggests, that we can only find the solulions to our problems 
when we admit there is a problem and discuss solulions in the open. 

Until we realize that these privileges prevent people from existing as 
human beings and start to correct these ongoing transgressions, things 
will never change.

Letters to the editor 



Department upset with column 



To Ihe Editor: 

We arc writing in response to the 
column by Edward Granzella 
regarding his experience in 
Psychology 120 last semester. Mr. 
Granzella was unhappy with Dr. 
Hill's Psychology 120 class and 
used his column to complain about 
the class. We believe this use of his 
column was unfortunate and irre- 
sponsible. 

In all classes there are some stu- 
dents who are pleased with (he 
class and some who are not. One of 
the most siartling things one notices 
when reading student evaluations is 
the drastically different responses 
that students have to the same class. 
One person loves it, the next hales 
it. One person responds warmly to 
the professor's attempt to produce 
fair exams, another berates tbe 
same behavior as the professor's 
attempt to win good evaluations. 
However, il is a hazard of the job of 
being a college professor, that at 
times some students arc unhappy 
with what you've done. 

There are opportunities to make 
one's feelings about any class 
known to the instructor or to the 



instructor's department chair. 
Course evaluations are given at the 
end of the semester, and students 
may use these to express their feel- 
ings about a course. A student may 
speak with the instructor or the 
chair at any time during or after the 
semester. To our knowledge, Mr. 
Granzella never approached Dr. 
Hill or Dr. Cannon, the Psychology 
Department chair, to express his 
concerns about his experiences in 
Psychology 120. Had he asked, he 
could have learned thai Dr. Hill 
uses a we 11- validated testing proce- 
dure. Mr. Granzella also alleged 
that only one Psychology 120 
insiructoriDr. Gcrow) requires stu- 
dents to read tbe textbook, and 
implied that standards aren't rigor- 
ous enough in Psychology 120, and 
thai more students should receive 
failing grades. Again, to our knowl- 
edge, Mr. Granzella never verified 
any of these allegations with ihe 
Psychology 120 instructors or the 
Psychology Department 

When one has a position as a 
reporter or columnisi with a student 
newspaper such as Tbe 
Communicator, one has access to a 
public forum that is not available to 



most sludents. With that access, 
there should also be the responsibil- 
ity to behave ethically. Wc believe 
that Mr. Granzella behaved unethi- 
cally by impugning Dr. Hill's 
integrity in a public forum without 
ever seeking him out privately to 
discuss his concerns. Surely be 
must realize thai every professor on 
this campus has had unhappy slu- 
dents from time to time. Even those 
professors who are held in (he high- 
est regard irritate some students 
some time. If these unhappy stu- 
dents were alt Communicator 
columnists we would have to read a 
column such as Mr. Granzclla's 
attack on Dr. Hill at leasl once in 
every issue. 

The appropriate way to evaluate 
professor's teaching is with a large 
number of student evaluations and 
regular classroom visits by faculty 
peers. The psychology Department 
uses such evaluations and has three- 
member faculty assistance commit- 
tees who regularly visit junior fac- 
ulty members' classes. In our view. 
it is not appropriate for tbe 
Communicator to allow disgruntled 
students to attack their professors 
simply because they happen to be

A voice from generation x 



By Edward Granzella, Jr. 
Sta IT columnist 

Around these pans, one thing 
needs to be added to the list of 
things which are noi discussed in 
polite conversation. That's abor- 
tion. Usually when someone is 
asked for his or her stance on the 
issue, you'll get one of three 
responses: pro-life, pro-choice, or 
stay away from me, I don't want to 
talk about il. I usually pick the lat- 
ter for convenience. I've always 
found a problem wiih each of the 
other positions. 

If you're pro-cboice, you have ihe 
law on your side, which is always 
nice. The main idea is that the 
woman has tbe right to decide what 
to do with her body That's one 
way of looking ai it. Another way 
of looking at il is this: the real right 
she's protecting is the inalienable 
right of every citizen to behave irre- 
sponsibly. 



In most cases, an abortion is 
desired because of an unplanned 
pregnancy; a child would be incon- 
venient. What the hell causes an 
unplanned pregnancy? The great 
majority are due lo some act of irre- 
sponsibility in which pregnancy is 
not necessarily Ihe worse outcome. 
Basically, abstinence, protection, or 
having a desire for a child — using 
your brain, eliminates the need for 
abortions. 

Pro-life groups, on the other hand, 
have a problem. They live in a soci- 
ety that allows under law a thing 
that they consider morally repre- 
hensible and which breaks one of 
the laws given lo us by God. They 
believe that if people embrace the 
teachings of the Bible and love life, 
again, mosi abortions would not be 
necessary. Bui instead of sticking to 
gelling people lo believe in the 
Good Book, they resort to dubious 
tactics to prevent abortions in an 
attempt to impose their beliefs on 



people who obviously do not share 
them. Through twisted logic, they 
believe that by eliminating legal 
abortions, people will develop a 
new respect for tbe newly con- 
ceived or start behaving responsi- 
bly. It isn't going to happen. All 
that will happen is that there will be 
more illegal abortions and more 
unwanted children bom. The prob- 
lem will jusi get worse. 

It's difficult to imagine a middle 
ground, where proponents of both 
sides of the abortion issue can meet, 
but I think I have iL I would pro- 
pose that we not allow abortions 
during pregnancy, except in certain 
cases. This would allow society to 
discover if this child is someone 
special, another Einstein or 
Messiah, for example. But if il's 
discovered that ihey have no rele- 
vant contribution to make, well, 
then we can abort them if deemed 
appropriate. This is really not a bad 
idea. If someone is convicted of a

crime, instead of sending them to 
prison to be yet another drain on 
our treasury, wc can perform a 
retroactive abortion. This could also 
be a great motivating factor for par- 
ents. Now, Johnny, eat your broc- 
coli. You don't want me to abort 
you, do you? 

The real question is, when does 
human life begin? At conception, as 
tbe pro-life folks believe, or at 
birth, as some pro-choice advocates 
believe I think the point at which 
human life begins is a function of 
medical technology. The point at 
which the developing fetus can be 
made into a fully-functioning per- 
son outside the womb is the point 
thai human life begins. Some day a 
scientist will create a method to 
create a human from egg and sperm 
totally outside (he womb. On that 
day life will begin at conception 
and abortions will be murder Thai 
day is not there yet, thank God.

Student concerned about parking 



Dear Editor, 

What's this about the parking? 
The students are going to be 
charged a dollar per credit hour for 
parking privileges and this will 
somehow prevent us from getting 
any more of those stupid parking 
tickets? You know what I don't like 
about those tickets? A credit hour 
here ALREADY costs S75. Why 
can't we park for free, and any- 
where we can find a spot? The stu- 
dents pay to come to school, noi 
the school pays the students. Why 
can't we make the rules on even 
these petty issues? In four semes- 
ters I've gotten three tickets: once 
for parking at a meter to gel into a 
chemistry test on time, and my 
meter hadn't even expired when I 



got back to the can once for park- 
ing one space beyond a "real" park- 
ing space and most recently for 
parking in the mysterious "E" lots. I 
bad to look up an E lot and see 
what it is. 

The 1/20/94 editorial slates thai 
most IPFW students commute. We 
all commute, don't wc? My first 
class is at 9 a.m. With other 
demands upon my time (like 2 
preschool children.) I can't reason- 
ably be expected to be here at 8 
a.m. scanning the parking lot for a 
space. Yet. like all the other stu- 
dents who commute, I want to go to 
class. 

So listen. Why can't the students 
make up the parking lot rules? For 
example: No A lots unless the fac- 
ulty go on paying for the privilege. 



Faculty have steady, decent 
incomes, unlike most students. No 
fees at all for the students to park. 
No B lots. No stupid crap about 
meters and non-spots. Most stu- 
dents just want to go to the classes 
they've AMPLY paid for — wc 
don't park on the lawn, after all. No 
E lols. Let the employees park in 
any spot they can find, or let them 
buy A lot tags loo. 

Please explain how charging 
around 12,000 students on average 
S8 more per year to park will allevi- 
ate parking tickets? Will this extra 
S96.000 per year help build another 
parking garage? 

Eagerly awaiting answers-

A dose 
of Douse 



Have African-Americans begun 

■■ use while folks as a scapegoat? 

Well, according to sociologist 
Jerry Smith in his book, "It's Time 
10 Slop Blaming the White Man," 
We (African-Americans) have 
been using the while race in gener- 
al and the while man in particular 
as i scapegoat." 

No, I don't feel that African- 
Americans have been using the 
while race as a scapegoat I do feci 
however African- Americans have 
the right 10 assign some of the 
blame for their condition on the 
group of people who caused them 
the most heartache. 

However, besides blaming the 
while race, African-Americans 
need to explore self and confront 
their own faults.. 

Before exploring this issue, I feel 
the need make one thing clear. 
There is only one race, the human 
race. If people would understand 
thai simple fact, race would not be 
an issue and racism would not 
exist 

Even Andrew Hacker, a political 
science professor of Queens 
College, slates in his book, 'Two 
Nations; Black and While. 
Separate, Hostile. Unequal," that 
"the idea of race is a human cre- 
ation." 

He also says thai "since there is 
no consensus when it comes down 
10 defining 'race,' Ihc term has 
been applied to a diversity of 
groups." 

So, how do we come up with this 
race called while and black? 

It's based on Ihc fact that these 
two different ethnic groups have a 
different color of skin. 

This difference is what continues 
to divide the United Slates. 

Once you take the idea of race 
being a human creation and apply 
what has happen in history, 
you may be able to understand why 
African-Americans arc upscl with 

'hilc Americans, 

Look at slavery, an institution 
based on treating another group of 
people is less than human for (he 
ilmighty dollar. Of course, nothing 
is wrong with stating Ihat slavery 
didn't start in ihc United Stales. 
True, slavery has been around for- 
ever. 

However, the United States and 
South Africa arc the only two 
places where slavery had a unique 
component, the inhuman (if that 
word is justice enough) treatment 
living, breathing, eating, and 
defecating person. 

The treatment of African people 
was completely intolerable. 
African women were sold, beaten, 
raped, punished while pregnant, 
and used as breeders for the white 
man. 

The relationship between African 
women and men was completely 
destroyed because of white owners 
selling them for profit and not 
allowing them to develop a rela- 
tionship. Without this relationship, 
African women experienced help- 
less throughout their entire 
experience because they had no 
one to defend them. 

They were, as well as African 
men, helpless until they began to 
emancipate their minds. 

When young African- Americans, 
look at history, they become angry 
with while folks because of what 
has happen. Now, I believe that 
African- Americans do have a right 
to be angry but not at present day 
while people for what happened 
back then because it is not their 
faulL 

However, while folks don't make 
it thai easy when they continue to 
believe in their stereotypes of 
African- Americans as being lazy, 
dumb, and as criminals. 

1 think if you look at the fact that 
slaves were beaten once put on a 
plantation, forced lo "pick" as 
much cotton as possible and given 
the responsible for feeding the 
cattle. 

While folks are the lazy ones. 
They built this country on the 
genocide of one group of people 

and the enslavement of another 

group because they were different 

and "animals." 
They make statements such as 

"You're different. You're not like 

the others," 

These statements make African- 
Americans feel alienated because 

all of a sudden ihey are different 

because some white person has 

said so. 
It doesn't surprise me thai 

African-Americans use white folks 

as Ibeir excuse, they live in a world 

of two privileges: white and male. 



Bicycle tour 

Healthy alternative to traditional spring break 



Cycle America*, organizer of 
America's largest annual coasi-to- 
coast bicycle tour, has announced its 
first annual Spring Break Tour for 
students and anyone interested in an 
early-season cycling adventure. The 
7-day cyclcfcst will be held in the 
old German town of Fredericksburg. 
Texas from March 13-19. 

The hill country of south Texas 
offers some of America's finest 
countryside for cycling. To accom- 
modate different abilities, cyclists 
can choose between a short or long 
loop ride each day. A "spider web" 
of farm-to-market country roads, 
beautiful hills covered with cedar 
and oak, and blooming flowers 
make for ideal cycling. Average 
daily high temperatures in the mid- 
70's with possibilities of 90's, 
should welcome cyclists from the 
snow-belt states with summertime 
warmth. 

The Fredericksburg area also 
offers riders over 80 sites to visit 
when not cycling. Notable sites 
include Pioneer Memorial Museum, 
Admiral Nimilz Museum, LBJ Stale 
Park, Lady Bird Johnson Memorial 
Park, Enchanted Rock Slate Park 
and famous Luckenbach. Bus shut- 
tles to San Antonio will also allow 
participants to visit such attractions 
as the Alamo, the River Walk, ihc 
Spanish Market Sea World, Whittc 
Museum and Fiesta Texas. 

A large tent campground with 
showers will serve as base camp for 
the week. Many bed and breakfast 
inns and motels are also available 
for those desiring indoor accommo-

dalions. Clinics on cycling, social 
activities and dancing to the local 
beat arc planned for the evening. 

Instead of taking the traditional 
spring break vacation at a beach, 
studenis have an opportunity to par- 
ticipate in a healthy event and meet 
lots of people from across America 
who share a common lifestyle. 

Since 1988. nearly 11,000 cyclists 
have participated in Cycle 
America's cross-counlry bicycle 
tour. The tour is divided into 12 
week-long segments so cyclists can 
cycle across America over a period 
of years or in a single summer. All 
tours, including the spring Break 



Tour, are fully supported with an 
excellent staff, support vehicles, 
campgrounds (usually at schools), 
showers, meals in most cases, daily 
maps, marked roads, mechanics, and 
everyone receives a t-shirt. 

Cost of the spring Break tour is 
S210 with a S40 discount for stu- 
dents. You will have lo bring your 
own bicycle, lent and sleeping bag if 
camping. If interested in the Spring 
Break and Coasi-to-Coast lours, call 
Cycle America' at (800) 245-3263 
and a brochure will be immediately 
sent to you.

Louise counsels students who need to get on with their lives 



Dear Aunt 
Louise, 

Recently, I 
was out and 
about with some 
girlfriends of 
mine when wc 
ran into my ex- 
boyfriend, who just happens to be 
my first love also. When we broke 
up, it wasn't on happy circum- 
stances. Anyway, we exchanged hel- 



lo* and wished each other well. 

A couple minutes he left 1 realize 
that I had not come lo terms yet with 
any of the feelings I have for him. I 
would like 10 see if we could give it 
another uy, but 1 don'l know if he is 
willing. 

Should I give it a try or what? 

Sincerely, If Only He Knew 

Dear If Only He Knew, 
Look, boneydew! You need to face 



some facts here. You two are no 
longer together. He has his own life 
and you have yours. Just because 
you two end up seeing each other 
out on the town does not mean that 
you two need to get together again. 

Now, you may have feelings for 
him. That is valid, turnip-lop. But 
you don't have to go out with him. 
You two may want to get together 
and discuss your old feelings for 
him. You can get together to tie up 



any old strings. 

Above ill of these things, get own 
with your life. 

Your loving Aunl Louise 

Dear Aunt Louise, 

I have just met this really net guy. 
We get along really well it's like 
everything is going great. There are 
no problems whatsoever between us. 
We are so comfortable together. 

So. what's the problem you may 



ask? To me it seems like things are 
going too well. [ do not want to get 
loo much into him &amp; then have 
every thing turn out different. Bui. I 
like him a lot. 
What should I do? 

Sincerely, 
Too Cautious For Love 

Dear Too Cautious For Love, 

Honey, the only thing I can tell 
you to do is go for it. You do not get 



anything in life unless you lake a 
mk and go for it, I am sure that if 
you take a chance some good things 
can happen. You can also end up 
getting hurt, but that is the cost you 
take. 

If Dorcus never asked my parents 
for my hand, I would probably still 
be single. 

So, just go for it! Things will work 
out for the best. 

Your loving Aunt Louise

Tanisha- 



by Tiinkha Washington 
Sports Editor 

Hello again fellow students. I 
often wonder why people bother to 
bet on athletics. They are so unpre- 
dictable bul we keep watching 
bccau.se we arc fascinated. 

Wc earth-bound couch potatoes 
can vicariously live out our greatest 
athletic fantasies through the hun- 
dreds of professional and college 
athletes who fill our TV screens 
dally. 

Wc sit on our nice comfortable 
couches or case back into a nice 
rccllncr to watch the game. Wc are 
cool, calm and collected sports fans 
anticipating an afternoon or 
evening of basketball, football, vol- 
leyball or the like. 

The game starts and for the first 
few seconds, perhaps even minutes, 
we stay cool calm and collected 
sports-fans enjoying the moment. 
The action heats up and suddenly 
our stomachs lighten . Wc lean for- 
ward in our seals and begin to talk 
lo the television like teammates 
calling instructions from the bench. 

Officials begin to make calls wc 
don't like or fail to make the calls 
wc would like. 

Our voices grow louder and now 
we're the disgruntled coach object- 
ing to referee decisions, we arc 
furious teammates ready to duke it 
out_ 

If the game is close, we become 
crazed motivators, jumping from 
our scats, flaring our limbs getting 
angry or ecstatic or both if ihc 
game see-saws. 

All signs of the composed indi- 
viduals wc once were are gone and 
wc have been transported to the 
action-packed world of sports 
where we can lose our cool, raise 
our voices, feel the pumping adren- 
aline of a hyped up player, feel like 
pan of the team, pan of the excite- 
ment, pan of the magic. 

Yes sports fans, or those of you 
who Bobby Knight would call "real 
fans," thank goodness for athletes 
and athletics. We can kick back 
and relax at the same time that we 
get excited wilhoul even breaking a 
sweat. And personally, I must say 
that is fan-tastic.

Sport* Editor 

As a team the Lady Dons are 
enjoying a successful season with 
13-5 and 6-3 records thus far, but 
fifth year senior. Pam Edwards has 
more reason than that to celebrate. 

Edwards suffered a career-threat- 
ening injury early last January dur- 
ing a routine scrimmage in prac- 
tice when she ruptured her 
Achilles and lore a calf muscle . 
Edwards was in a cast for two 
weeks and also bad surgery on the 
leg before beginning therapy that 
lasted until November. Edwards 
said thai after her surgery she 
overheard bcr doctor telling her 
father she would never play bas- 
ketball again and that fueled bcr 
determination lo get back on the 
court. 

She not only made it back onio 
the court, she was pre-scason All- 
American and scored her 1,000th 
career point during the Dons win 
over Southern Indiana on 
Saturday, January 15th. Needless 
to say, she is pleased to be playing 
again. Edwards said she appreci- 
ates the support teammates, fans 
and relatives have shown and is 
especially happy the entire team is 
winning. 

"Individually I'm not doing as 
well as I'd like to be doing but as a 



team I couldn't ask for more. 
We're off to the best start in the 
history of the school... We'll prob- 
ably be in the NCAA tournament 
and are in line for the champi- 
onship... Right now I'm really 
thinking in terms of the team. I 
warn the people who haven't expe- 
rienced going to the NCAA to gel 
thai chance like I did as a junior 
and freshman," she said. 

What does Pam Edwards think 
of her teammates? 

"We get along belter than any 
team in the past. We have a lot of 
comedians on our team, , said 
Edwards with a smile for some 
remembered prank, "but we have a 
common goal... Wc all want lo 
win the conference so that makes 
it easier lo go in there and work 
bard," she said. 

Edwards has received a degree in 
Psychology and is working on 
another in education. She intends 
to become a teacher and to coach 
basketball at the high school level. 

She will get a start on half of bcr 
goals this summer when she helps 
and her former junior high school 
coach will coach an AAU team. 

Edwards said Ibis experience has 
strengthened her resolve to reach 
new heights regardless of other 
people's expectations of her and 
she encourages others to try to do

challenge, overcoming Injury to

the same. 

"Overall, the doctors told me I 
would probably never play again. I 
just want my teammates and other 
people lo know that just because 
you're told you can't do some- 
thing, it's not set in concrete. You 
have to be willing to take risks in 
order to accomplish your goals," 
said Edwards.
