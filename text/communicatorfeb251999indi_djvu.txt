Offending file creates security breach 



File temporarily 
makes student 
information 
available 

by Mishanna Wood, 
News Editor 

and 
Adam Taylor. 
Features Editor 

A securit)' breach on a 
systems support file that cre- 
ates campus e-mail accounts 
on a weekly basis was report- 
ed to information and 
Technology Services on 
Friday, Feb. 12, by Mitch 
Morrison, a student consultant 
for ITS and a supplemental 
instructor for CSICO. 

Morrison said tie 
informed Cjnthia Elicit, com- 
puter operations supervisor, 
of the problem on PINE, a 
UNIX-based Program for 
Internet News and E-mail. 

According to Bob 



Kostrubanic, teclinical support 
director of ITS, the breach was 
no longer in existence on Feb. 
17. 

Morrison understands the 
ramifications he may face for 
speaking out. 

"I fear what a mali- 
cious hacker could do 
more than what an 
administrator could 
do," Morrison said. 

While a security 
breach was reported to 
ITS, no disciplinar) 
action has been taken 
against an&gt;one for vio- 
lating the Student 
Conduct Code. 

"There has been 
no need to take disci- 
plinary action against any stu- 
dents for security violations." 
Donna Bialik, dean of stu- 
dents, said. 

Ntichael Mourey, manager 
of technical support for ITS, 
said he was aware of issues 
last December svhich pertain 
to this incident. 

Michael Boschet, nelviork 
systems programmer for ITS. 
was the person responsible for 
solving the security problem. 

Moure) and Kostrubanic 



said that a student consultant, 
whose identity cannot be 
revealed, is documenting the 
situation and is working with 
ITS to make sure the hole is 
completelj- patched up. 

"It was serious enough 



"There were security holes we 
became aware of after a 
review of the software." 

-Michael Mourey, 
Manager of Technical Support, ITS 



that we wanted to stop it. PJNE 
was upgraded to version 
4.10," Kostrubanic said. 
"There liave been no prob- 
lems in the past that anyone 
has told us about." 

Mourey said the 4.10 ver- 
sion of PINE is more secure 
than the version formerly 
used on campus, version 3.96. 

UNIX is an operating sys- 
tem similar to Macintosh or 
Windows. It's generally used 
for larger sjstem^, Boschet 



said. 

William Baden, coordina- 
tor of academic computing, 
said the problem was in UNIX, 
which is the s&gt;stems support 
program for student e-mail 
and student web pages. 

While reading an e- 
mail, the screen would 
occasionally change to 
bring up a screen with a 
dollar sign prompt. 

The system made a 
user involuntarily exit 
the mail system. 

A user would then see 
a screen which dis- 
played his or her per- 
sonal account file. 

The onl&gt;' danger that 
might exist, said Baden, 
was if a person had a pass- 
word of another user. The 
most one could do was change 
around information in an 
account file. 

"There were security 
holes we became aware of 
after a review of the software," 
said Mourey. "We decided that 
this was the best response to 
the security hole. There were 
not any serious problems, but 
it allowed someone who knew 
how to break into the base

UNIX command shell " 

"M&gt; guess was that some- 
bodj had modified a s\stem 
file b&gt; e-mailing it to them- 
selves and changing it to fool 
the network security," said 
Boschet. "Students won't be 
able to access this bug any- 
more. The s&gt;stem's dependcn- 



cj' on the file being used was 
removed." 

Morrison has the same 
account of the problem, but 
with a slight variation.

How much personal information can be disclosed via computer? 



by Mictiael Snyder, 
Copy Editor 

Students with personal and aca- 
demic information on interactive 
computer ser\'ices are protected by 
laws such as The Social Securit&gt;' On- 
line Privacy Act of 1996 and The 
Family Educational Rights and 
Privacy Act. 

An interactive computer ser\'ice 
refers to any information service 
that provides computer access to 



multiple users via modem or other 
means of telecommunication to the 
Internet or an)' other on-line net- 
work. 

According The Social Security 
On-Line Privacy Act of 1996, "An 
interactive computer service shall 
not, by means of a reference service 
or otherwise, disclose to a third 
party (1) an individual's Social 
Securit)' account number, or (2) per- 
sonally identifiable information 
which is identifiable to an individual 
by means of the individual's Social 



Security account number without the 
individual's prior informed written 
consent." 

The Family Educational Rights and 
Privacy Act. also known as The 
Buckley Amendment, gives students 
the right to inspect their education 
records. 

According to Patrick Mclaughlin, 
associate registrar, "There are three 
rights to this act; the right to inspect 
education records, the right to 
request to amend education records 
and the righuto limit disclosure of 



personally identifiable information 
contained in education records." 

"We can give out directory 
information if we give students pub- 
lic notices such as page 298 in the 
student bulletin. Public notice gives 
the registrars the right to make 
information such as name, class 
standing, dates of attendance, stu- 
dent activities, address and tele- 
phone number available to the pub- 
lic," Mclaughlin said. 

Information that is not accept- 
able to be given to the public 



includes gender, ethnicity, grade 
point average, social security num- 
ber or any other student identifica- 
tion number. 

"Social security numbers made 
public such as grade posting identifi- 
cation has stopped. If a violation is 
found at IPFW. it is stopped and will 
no longer occur," said Mclaughlin. 

Complaints can be reported to 
the United States Secretary 
Department of Education.

Committee seeks 
new vice chancellor 
of Academic Affairs 



by Gail Ruble-Crawford, 
Editor 



The university is currenilj inter- 
viewing candidates for vice chancellor of 
Academic Affairs. 

The current vice chancellor of 
Academic Affairs. Susan B. Hannah, has 
a one-year contract that expires in 
August. 

Because Hannah's position was tem- 
porary, a search for a permanent 
replacement began as soon as a commit- 
tee was appointed by Chancellor Michael 
Wartell. 

The Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Search Committee is chaired b&gt; 
Steve Sarratore, associate professor of 
theatre. 

The committee consists of Sarratore, 
James Hersberger, associate chair and 
professor of mathematical sciences; 
Kimberly McDonald, associate professor 
and program coordinator of 
Organizational Leadership and 
Super\'ision; Alan Sandstrom, professor 
of sociology and anthropology; Dipak 
Chowdhury, professor of geosciences; 
James Jones, dean of Health Sciences, 
and Meg Ross, IPSGA comptroller. 

According to Sarratore, the commit- 
tee began advertising for permanent 



candidates earl&gt; last fall. 

The position was advertised nation- 
ally in higher education publications; 
nominations were solicited on campus 
and special mailings were sent to 
schools both within and without the lU- 
Purdue system. 

The committee then screened inter- 
ested applicants with specific criteria 
and narrowed the pool to a select few. 

Next, telephone interviews were 
conducted, references were checked and 
interviews were scheduled. 

"We tried to get the candidates here 
before spring break," said Sarratore. 

As soon as the interviews are sched- 
uled, the committee notified the campus 
and communit&gt; through open meetings, 
notes to various organizations and bul- 
letin board notices. 

When the candidates visit campus, 
they have an opportunity to meet with 
various members of the IPFW communi- 
ty, including students, faculty and com- 
munity members. 

According to Hersberger, the feed- 
back received is an important factor in 
the committee's final decision.

Funding: Budget shortfalls affect campus, local community 



byCarrieAnneLeathere, 
Ctiiel Reporter 

Funding shortages at IPFW are only 
one part of an S85 million shortfall in 
distributions being returned to the 
Northeastern Indiana communilj (NEl) by 
the state go\ernment. 

The Community Research Institute of 
IPFW spent the last year verifying this 
shortage in the state government operat- 
ing expenditure, and recently released 
the final report to the public. 

"Their purpose was strictly to show 
the numbers and figures," said Bart 
Tyner, communications specialist, 
Uni\'ersit&gt;' Relations and 
Communications. "It will be up to the 
community to decide if the&gt; want to act 
upon it." 



Both (K-12 and higher education), 
transportation, health and human ser- 
vices, economic development and infra- 
structure de\elopment are all receiving 
distributions from the state in amounts 
significantly less than what the NEl 
region is contributing to the state operat- 
ing budget. 

"We feel like it's reflected in the bud- 
get at IPFW." said Chancellor Michael 
Wartell. 

As a whole, higher education in NEl 
during 1994-96 was shorted S12.6 mil- 
lion. 

This was only 7.81 percent of the 
money allocated to the state's higher edu- 
cation fund, despite the fact NEl has 9.38 
percent of the state's higher education 
enrollment and contributions. 

This area also made up 9.95 percent 
of the stale's operating budget. 



According to the report, economic 
development has been shorted SI. 9 mil- 
lion and transportation S4.1 million, 
based on the 9.95 percent of the state 
budget coming from NEl. 

"I think that there is a general idea 
that this has been happening, but I think 
that this report makes it more concrete." 
said Tyner. 

The report observed that several of 
the expenditures and/or distributions are 
"formula-driven," and the reasons for 
the shortfalls lie somewhere in the details 
of the formulas. 

Although the report did analyze the 
state government operating expenditure 
and state government revenue analysis, it 
did not look into these formulas. 

"It will be up to others to determine 
the formulas," Tyner said. "There are 
other avenues for pursuing the formation 



of the formulas." 

Although nothing 
has been changed \et, 
Wartell is glad that 
efforts are being made, 

"I think that the CRl 
did an excellent job of 
gathering the data," said 
Wartell. "The university 
is working hard to 
change the budget. It's 
gratifying to see the 
number of people work- 
ing at IPFW to make the 

budget better."

tion or to receive a copy of the complete 
report, contact Tyner at 481-6170 or visit

"What do I do with all 
of this money?" 




TOPIC: 

U.S. Involvement 

WHAT WE 
THINK: 

Take care of your 
own before you 
take care of 
others. 



Everyone has heard of 
what has been going on in 
Koso\'0 and in Iraq, but is 
there an end in sight? Since 
the Gulf War, we have 
enforced a no-fly zone over 
areas of Iraq. This brings us 
to the issue of U.S. foreign 
affairs involvement. 

It seems if there is any- 
thing going in this world our 
go\ernment has its nose stuck 
right in it. All of this is done 
in the guise of bringing free- 
dom and democrac&gt;' to all 
people and is reminiscent of 
the way Christianity was 
spread to the Native 
Americans. 

Its all fine and dandy that 
the government is concerned 
with international affairs, but 
there should be a line drawn 
as to when too much time is 
being spent overseas rather 
than on our own soil. 

What is this country com- 
ing to? Problems are explod- 
ing in our faces almost dailj' 
about the downfall of our 



political s\siem and society. 

Now that the smog sur- 
rounding the president's love 
life has oegun to clear, other 
societal woes are beginning to 
surface. It seems as if things 
on the home front are run- 
ning out of control, even 
though our economy is sup- 
posed to be booming. 

A white supremacist was 
found guilty Tuesdaj' of mur- 
der in a trial in Texas. The 
man chained a black man and 
dragged him behind a pickup 
truck for about 3 miles. The 
prosecutors in the case say 
that this was an act to draw 
attention to a new white 
supremacist group. 

All individuals are enti- 
tled to their own thoughts, 
but when those thoughts 
cause others to lose their life. 
the government needs to take 
action. Hateful crimes like 
this one aren't a rare occur- 
rence. A homosexual college 
student in Wyoming was 
humiliated and killed bj' 
other students. 

The American go\ernment 
needs to spend more money 
on groups to spread under- 
standing about the individual 
differences. 

Anotner cnaotic mess is 
the development in New York 
with the bo\s in blue. 
Plainclothes police officers 
fired a total or 41 shots at an 
unarmed immigrant outside 
of his residence killing the 
man. The event has drawn a 
whirlwind of international 
attention to our crime fight- 



country is also beginning to 
falter. Rev. Jerry Falwell has 
been causing a stir in the gay 
communities. Falwell, like 
other conservative religious 
leaders, has been finding 



e\ils in watching television 
and the morals that it sup- 
ports. 

Falwell claims that Tinky- 
Wink\-. one of the notorious 
Teletubbies, is gay. Falwell 
singlehandedly broke the 
hearts of thousands of chil- 
dren. Gaj' activists sa&gt;' that 
this is just another attempt to 
p.ut gays in the spotlight and 
displa}' them as being bad. 

There is ver&gt;- little that 
the government can do about 
this, but this is just a simple 
example of how people are 
not willing to be accepting of 
each other. 

The government needs to 
take action here at home 
before spending a lot of our 
tax dollars on salvaging the 
lives of people in other coun- 
tries. The image of "Big 
Brother" needs to oe changed^ 
It's time that our government 
spends a little more time tak- 
ing care of its own people.

Commentary 



Wasting our lives away 



by Matthew Perry, 
Staff Writer 



Computers are Evil 



Tick-Tock-Tick-Tock. 

Hear that? That is 
the sound of our lives 
passing right before our 
eyes. Nobody lives by 
the minute anymore. 
Everybody has been 
brainwashed to believe 
that work is more impor- 
tant than anything else. 

1 read something the 
other day that said "Live 
your life to the fullest. 
nobody ever said 'I wish 
I had spent more time at 
the office' whiie on their 
deathbed." 

When we graduate, 
our lives will revolve 
around that circle with 
numbers and slicks even 
more than it does now. 
Wake up at 6, shower, 
shave (legs, face, what- 
ever), eat breakfast and 
go to work at 8. 

Work until noon. 
when you might be 
blessed with a half-hour 
lunch-hour, then at 5, 
go home, cook and eat 
dinner, watch TV. then 
go to sleep where the 
process begins anew. 

Is this the way you 
want to live your life? 
Wouldn't you rather do 
something constructive? 

Of course, we all do, 
but it's not as easy as it 
might sound because the 
American public has 
been brainwashed to live 
in a continuous circuit. 

People need more 
excitement in their lives, 
and for good reason. 
Our natural instincts, 
which we try to sup- 
press, are to hunt for 
our food. 

We haven't had a 
majority of people in 
this country who needed 
to hunt as their sole 
source of food for a 
hundred years. That's it, 
a hundred years. Now 



we have grocery stores, 
where we can further 
suppress our natural 
instincts. 

True, there are the 
weekend hunters, but 
they hunt and kill for 
pleasure, not for suste- 
nance, so they are no 
better than the rest of 
us. 

But, think about 
this. The earth has been 
around for about 4 bil- 
lion years, and life start- 
ed about 3.5 billion 
years ago. But, humans 
have only been around 
for about a quarter of a 
million years. 

Humans just 

appeared on this planet 
in an eye blink ago. But 
even 250,000 years is a 
long time, and to have 
had most of out technol- 
ogy develop within the 
last couple hundred is, 
to say a word, incredi- 
ble. 

But, now we don't 
even need to do any- 
thing. We could work 
from home, sending our 
bosses our work by fax 
machine or e-mail. We 
can go shopping on the 
internet and ha\'e it 
delivered to our doors 
within a couple of days. 

So, this brings me to 
the point that the com- 
puter industry is direct- 
ly involved in the fur- 
ther stupefying of the 
human race. 

Think about it, what 
other product is obso- 
lete before &gt;ou even 
take it out of the store? 
Technology is so 
advanced that if we 
could discover the secret 
of time travel (which is 
implying that it hasn't 
yet been discovered and 
then covered-up by the 
government) and bring 



even our most outdated 
technology to cavemen, 
they would be flabber- 
gasted. This would also 
be true if we took a top- 
of-the-Iine computer to 
someone 10 years ago. 

I got my first com- 
puter about 7 &gt;'ears ago. 
It was a 386-25 MH?. 
with 1 meg of RAM. 
both 5.25- and 3.5-inch 
floppy drives, and a 
250 megab&gt;te hard 
drive. That was a lot 
back then. 

Mj' second comput- 
er 1 got about 3 year* 
ago. it is a Pentium 75 
MHz with 16 megs of 
RAM, 4X CD-ROM, 3.5 
inch floppy, 14.4 kbps 
modem and a 1,3 giga- 
byte hard drive. This 
was quite an improve- 
ment then, now it is next 
to nothing. 

Of course I upgraded 
both computers. I added 
a CD-ROM/Soundblaster 
and 4 megs of RAM to 
the first one, and a 56K 
modem and a 

Superdisk'^'" drive to the 
second one. 

No other technology 
docs this. You could buy 
a television and it will 
last you without any 
problems for at least 10 
years, until they make 
the new DTV, or Digital 
Television, the standard. 

I don't know how the 
computer industry can 
triple its technology in a 
week, but Bill Gates'"! 
has to be responsible. 

The computer indus- 
try's only interest is 
making people as com- 
puter-dependent as pos- 
sible and then taking 
over the world. 

So, who's to argue 
with me that Bill 
Gates"" is not really

suit, with Pinky hid- 
ing somewhere in the 
sidelines, possibly as the 
Apple CEO. 

Not that people 
aren't computer-depen- 
dent anyway. If we 
weren't, and if every 
company on the planet 
wasn't operated by Big 
Brother, would this Y2K 
"bug" worry us as much? 

The answer to that is 
an emphatic "NO!" Y2K 
is not a "bug," but a 
ploy made years ago bj' 
the computer industr\ 
to make everyone on the 
planet ha\'e to bu&gt; a 
new computer at the 
turn of the millennium. 

So, in conclusion, 
people need to get out 
of their computer chairs 
for 10 seconds a day DO 
SOMETHING! 

Because, even when 
you're at home, you're 
still on a computer, and 
Big Brother likes it that 
way, even though 1984 
was 15 years ago, 
George Orwell wasn't 
that far off and Winston

1 was walking through 
downiown fori Wayne the 
other day and I noticed 
something very peculiar. 

People in this town, 
including myself, are over- 
weight. I guess I shouldn't 
use our downtown as a 
model for how this city 
looks, but it seemed like the 
best place. 

1 wasn't out there look- 
ing for overweight people; 
they Just sort of surrounded 
me. 

Let me just say this, if 
you are overweight, or fat. 
or whatever we are called 
these days, don|lt get alt mad 
because I'm not -making fun 
of obesity, I'm just com- 
menting on it. 

But next time you go 
out in public, check it out. 
The Midwest is full of "fat" 
people. 

1 think the main reason 
we are fat as a nation is 
because we are lazy. There 
are other sensitive areas as 
to why we eat so much. 

There are a lot of peo- 
ple with issues that are none 
of our business. Something 
that ma&gt; have happened in 
their childhood, or majbe 
an event as an adult has dri- 
ven us to consume so much. 

There could be a genet- 
ic issue involved. Maybe j ou 
just have really bad metabo- 
lism. 

Maybe instead of alco- 
hol, cigarettes, or gambling, 
you eat. I was told to never 
stare ai fat people because 
they were already aware of 
their problem. 

If they ar.^.aware, why 
;don't th«&gt;' dirrome thing" 
about it? 

It makes me wonder 
why people are so preoccu- 



pied with weight an&gt;way. 

I don't understand how 
someone could be anorexic, 
I think it is scary knowing 
that you could actually lose 
so much weight that you 
die. 

It is a predominantly 
female problem; so again, it 
is hard for me to see the 
emotional strain. The slogan 
for the American teen is to 
be thin and be attractive. 

This doesn't apply to 
the Midwest, although I 
think some kids try awful 
hard to be thin. 

On the other hand, it is 
hard for me to deny myself 
a huge steak and potato, 
sour cream and butter 
included of course. 

When 1 was younger 
and involved in high school 
athletics, I was at an ideal 
weight for a 17-year-old. 

Coaches made sure you 
didn't get too out of shape 
because it could effect your 
performance on the field. 

You had to stay in 
shape to be attractive to the 
opposite sex (because I'm 
straight, and by the wa)-, 
proud). 

You could be ugly but 
you could have a nice body. 
You could be stupid, but 
have a great behind. The 
body made the person. 

Ever)' year, new forms 
of weight loss programs are 
designed for the consumer. 

The latest is Tai-Bo. Sort 
of a cross between Tai Chi 
and boxing. Whatever. 
These programs are 
designed to make monej', 
and make people feel like 
They are geitihg their mon-"" 
ey's worth. 

Do you think Richard 
Simmons really cares about 



all of those fat women that 
he visits? Prancing around 
in his little shorts and his 
goofy haircut like some sort 
of diet elf. Wouldn't you 
love to know what he makes 
in a year? 

Jane Fonda, any model, 
steroid-filled men, celebri- 
ties: everybod)' has a video 
exercise program, even 
Vanna White. That is really 
sad. What is worse is that 
people actually buy these 
tapes. 

What about all of the 
diets that pop up about 
every three months? 

The grapefruit. Mayo 
Clinic, protein and carbo 
diet are just a few of the lat- 
est 'fad' diets. 

It sort of reminds me of 
today's popular music. 

Most of it isn't very 
good, but as people begin to 
talk about all of the crappy 
music, others feel left out 
and must join the craze by 
buying into the music, 
regardless of how good it is. 

Same goes for dieting. 
Your metabolism dictates 
what diet is good for jou, 
and of course &gt; our doctor. 

Don't let a neighbor or 
friend tell you what's best 
for you. 

Would you like to know 
how to lose weight without 
dieting? It is very easy. 

Here's what you have to 
do: Park your car as far 
away from class as possible 
and walk your fat ass to 
class! It's called exercise 
people. The diet comes sec- 
ond. 

If you would just get off 
the couch long enough to 
walk arqjjnd the block a 
couple of times a week, you 
would gradually notice a 



Security breach, continued from Page 1 



"I won't dispute it from a 
personal standpoint that it is 
correct to state that the only 
way your files are directly in 
danger is b&gt;' someone else," 
said Morrison, 

Morrison said the breach 
was within a systems support 
file that creates e-mail 
accounts on a weekly basis. 
This file was from the 
Registrar's Office, Morrison 
said it is very secure. 

UNIX gets into this sys- 
tem to get student informa- 
tion such as addresses and ID 
numbers. This is to create e- 
mail accounts and verifj if 
the e-mail user is a student. 

"That list (the list of stu- 
dent e-mail and web page 
information) was left readable 
to anyone who got the dollar 
sign prompt. You could read 
anyone's information. This is 
not a part of the standard 
UNIX file. It is something that 
ITS created. It's all in their 
security system development 
to make sure that everyone is 
entitled to make an account 
on Holmes. If they start a per- 
son in the middle of the 
semester, they can get you on 
very quickly. The list is made 
readable to everyone," 
Morrison said. 

"The problem has been in 
its initial state where every- 



one can read it since the fall 
of '98, I cannot comment 
before fall, because 1 was not 
here before then. I've been 
afraid to see if the problem 
still exists, I did not want to 
get caught in the crossfire," 
Morrison said. 

Boschet said UNIX is used 
primarily by the campus for 
e-mail and student web pages. 
Mourey said PINE was chosen 
because lU had it installed. 
The decision was made on a 
support perspective, making it 
better and easier to use, IPFW 
uses the Hewlett Packard UNIX 
system. 

Purdue has operated on 
UNIX since it first came out, 
around seven or eight years 
ago, said Jim Morrison, direc- 
tor of clinical computing and 
intelligent system develop- 
ment at Purdue. Jim Morrison 
is the father of Mitch 
Morrison, who initially report- 
ed the problem to IPFW. 

"Clearly, maintaining 
security of computer systems 
requires open sharing of 
information. Purdue has one 
of the nation's most respected 
experts on computer security 
in the nation," said Jim 
Morrison, referring to Eugene 
Spafford of the computer sci- 
ence department at Purdue. 

"I would think that per- 



Vice chancellor, continued from Page 1 



"These are their con- 
stituents, and their input is 
very important," added 
Sarratore, 

The committee members 
then make a recommendation 
to the chancellor. The chan- 
cellor's final decision must 
then be approved by Purdue 
President Steven Beering and 
the Purdue University Board 
of Trustees, 

There are three candi- 
dates for the position: Patrick 
Schloss, currently assistant 
Vice President and dean of 
graduate studies at 

Bloomsburg University, 
Pennsylvania; James Pula, 



dean of The Metropolitan 
College of Catholic 
Universities, Maryland, and 
Greg Weisenstein. dean of the 
School of Education at The 
University of Colorado.

Schloss visited campus on 
Monday; Pula will be visiting 
campus today and tomorrow 
and Weisenstein will be visit- 
ing campus on Monday and 
Tuesday. 

"The search is going pret- 
ty well. The first candidate 
visited campus this week, and 
the other two candidates will 
be visiting campus later this 
week and early next week," 
said Chowdhury. 



sons at the regional campuses 
might want to seek advice if 
they have a security problem 
they are having difficult)- in 
solving," Jim Morrison said, 

"In setting up our stu- 
dent e-mail, IPFW checked out 
what other universities were 
using and decided upon the 
one we have because it suited 
our needs the best," Boschet 
said. 

The type of tools the 
schools put their information 
on is the factor that deter- 
mines whether or not they 
could be affected, Moure&gt; 
said. 

He added there was a 
security hole in UNIX, and 
UNIX is generally known for 
that. 

"There are many kinds of 
UNIX and they all have their 
own little security holes," 
Mourey said. 

"We don't talk to other 
satellite schools directl&gt; but 
I'm sure they have computer 
security problems," said 
Boschet. 

"There are a multitude of 
ways to have this happen to 
us. Someone will alwaj s tr&gt;' to 
find a way to get in," said 
Kosirubanic. 

"As a computer profes- 
sional, I do not think that the 
details of security problems 



According to Chancellor 
Michael Wartell, abbreviated 
resumes are available for each 
candidate in the Helmke 
Library at the Information 
Desk. 

Sarratore feels that the 
process, though long, has 
resulted in three very quali- 
fied candidates. 

"It's a long process, but 
it's a good process. This uni- 
versity has had, I think, prob- 
lems with academic leadership 
in the past. Hopefully this 
process will bring good acade- 
mic leadership that will last 
several years," said Sarratore. 



difference. 

Then &gt; ou can start 
working on what you shove 
in your pie hole. Be smart 
about what &gt; ou eat. Avoid 
things that taste really 
good. Fried foods especially. 

Also, eat a lot of salads 
and drink only water. Just 
use common sense. 

Don't shove a Kettler 
pizza down &gt;our throat and 
slam a DIET PEPSI, It doesn't 
work that way , people. 

Also, candy and all of 
the other crap in the 
machines on campus Is full 
of fat. 

Everything at a ballpark 
or the Coliseum Is out of 
the question, too. Just way 
too much fat. 

If you want to eat these 
fatty foods, you have to 
exercise. 

There is no reason to go 
out and spend any money 
on an exercise tape. Just 
walk over to the Gates 
Center, or on a treadmill, or 
in your neighborhood. 

And unfortunately, 
you'll need to avoid alcohol. 
If you are a drinker, switch 
to beer because I heard that 
spirits have more calories in 
them. 

This is just what 1 
heard. I'm not saying it's 
true. 

Seriously, look around 
you right now. See how 
overweight the guy or girl 
next to you is? 

Go to Glenbrook, any- 
where in this town and 
you'll notice what I notice 
on a daily basis working 
downtown. 

' Being overweight can be 
a choice. 

Stop blaming yourself 
and get up off your behind 



and get some exercise. 

It doesn't cost anything 
to get yourself back in 
shape. 

Remember, Spring 
Break is just around the cor- 
ner: Don't eat too much.

InterVarsity Christian Fellowship hosts conference at IPFW 



by Jodi Schierling, 
Slaff Writer 



Nearly 150 students from all over Northern 
Indiana joined 40 staff members for Summit '99. 
InterVarsity Christian Fellowship's third annual 
metja-conference on Saturday and Sunday. 

This major gathering of InterVarsity students 
and staff was designed to give students opportuni- 
ties to gather with other InterVarsity members from 
around the state and spend a weekend together 
learning about what it means to live a lifest&gt; le com- 
mitted to Jesus Christ. 

"It's great to know other people my age are 
seeking to know God and grow closer to Him," said 
Sarah Spooner, a 19-year-old prospective student. 

For three days students participated in one or 
four courses or tracks of study that consisted of six 
sessions. Each track contained 30 to 60 participants. 

To encourage an atmosphere where all students 
felt comfortable learning and sharing, most tracks 
provided two times of small group study and discus- 
sion. 

The other four track sessions contained power- 
ful insights into each topic through lecture, video, 
skits and open question-and-answer opportunities. 

The first track students couid select was 
"Foundations." During the weekend, the participants 
endeavored to strengthen their foundation of 
Christian discipleship. 

"Digging into Romans" e.xamined Paul's letter to 
the Church of Rome by teaching principles of study- 
ing the Bible through investigating facts in the Bible 
and forming sound conclusions. 

The third alternative was "Loving Justice." 
where students began to grow in their understand- 
ing of how God sees injustice and what they can do 
to be a part of oxercoming the inequities in our 
world. 

"In the 'Loving Justice' track, I learned that 
there can only be social justice when we activelj 
seek it and when we have biblical love as our foun- 
dation," said Jeff Drummond, 23. junior. 

The final course of study was entitled "Spiritual 
Guidance." In this track, the students dug into the

Bible to find out specifics about how to know what 
God's will is for their lives. 

"'Spiritual Guidance' encouraged me to keep 
seeking God everyday with all of my heart." said 
Jennifer Inman, 19, sophomore. "The session leaders 
taught in a way that was understandable and the\ 
made biblical principles applicable to my life." 

Saturday evening was a time of reflection on 
what students svere learning through praise, worship 
and sharing as a whole group. 

"The worship was incredible." said Karia M&gt;'ers. 
20. junior. "After studying through the Romans 
track and learning what we once were in our sin and 
how God's mercy saved us from our sin, during wor- 
ship It all became very real and I could sense God so 
close." 

This conference is held by IVCF ever&gt;' year as a 
part of developing students' faith in Jesus Christ. 

IVCF is a student-led, staff-supported organiza- 
tion on over 600 campuses in the United States, and 
o\er 133 countries in the world. 

The organization began in 1941 when a group 
of Canadian IVCF students took an offering during a 
weekend conference to send Che Tirst IVCF staff 
worker to the United States. 

It is now the oldest and largest Christian evan- 
gelical organi^tation on unixersity campuses all over 
the world. 

"What's great about the InterVarsity is that 
Christians from many universities and all levels of 
life come together, one in the bodj' of Christ, and 
learn to respect each other's uniqueness," said Joe 
Whitchurch, IVCF Area Director for Indiana. 

IVCF at IPFW and at schools across the world 
desire to provide a supportive community for all 
students by providing resources for spiritual growth 
through leadership development, mission opportu- 
nities, spiritual mentoring, Bible study and many 
opportunities to receive training and teaching based 
on biblical ideals. 

"At these conferences students are 
made aware of the larger scope of IVCF 
USA and they are e\posed to some of the 
best Christian student leadership training 
available today," said Kent Zicssler, IPFW 
InterVarsity staff and Conference 



Director. "I can clearly saj that after working for 12 
years with lnterVarsit&gt;- myself at IPFW that God is 
developing student leaders of character and integri- 
ty- on the campuses of Indiana through this wonder- 
ful organization, and through conferences like 
Summit '99!" 

The IPFW chapter of IVCF meets every- Friday in 
Walb Rm. G21 for worship and study. 

More information on the Fort Wajne IVCF chap- 
ter and IVCF USA can be found on the InterVarsicj' 
website under "Religious Organizations" on the IPFW 
homepage.

Money was raised 
towards the general schol- 
arship fund at lU 
Bloomington because of 
Presidential Switch Day. 

For the past five years, 
students have purchased 
raffle tickets in an attempt 
to switch places with 
Indiana University 

President Myles Brand for 
the day. 

Ihe winner of the raf- 
fle heads Brand's office for 
the day while Brand 
attends the student's class- 
es. 

Brand likes to do this 
because it keeps him in 
touch with students and 
what students are doing," 



said DeAnna Hines, execu- 
tive director of communi- 
cations for Indiana 
University, 

Both the lU student 
foundation and the lU stu- 
dent alumni association at 
Bloomington run publicity 
for the event and sell the 
raffle tickets. 

This \'ear, junior Erica 
Krouch from Tipton 
Indiana was chosen and 
got to sca&gt; in Brand's 
office during part of the 
day, attend meetings, 
speak with emplojees 
about any problems or 
questions, and learn about 
hoxv the university func- 
tions in general. 

Brand attended 

Krouch's classes and the 
two also met up at the end 
of the day for the presen- 



tation of the monej earned 
for the general scholarship 
fund from the raffle. 

Although IPFW cur- 
rentlj does no such fund- 
raiser. Chancellor Michael 
Wartell is not opposed to 
the idea and would discuss 
tht}ijip,:iS.ibilJ,ti&gt;:.itL_ao .IPFW, i 
organization approached 
him. 

"It sounds like a good 
idea and if we could raise 
more mone&gt;- for the gener- 
al scholarship fund it 
would be wonderful," 
Wartell said. 

The Alumni 

Association is currentlj' 
planning to discuss the 
consideration of starting a 
similar fund-raiser for 
IPFW. 



Cinema Center presents 
Monument Ave. 




by Adam Taylor, 
Features Editor 



Which is more impor- 
tant, pride or your friends 
and lo\ed ones? 

In Ted Demme's film 
"Monument Ave.," this topic 
is explored as a cast of such 
noted celebrities as Denis 
Leary, John Diehl, Martin 
Sheen and Jeanne 
Tripplehom come together to 
tell a tale of love, loyally, 
betrayal and honor among 
thieves. 

In an ever-changing cit&gt;', 
one area of Boston seemed to 
survive the invasion of the 
upper-class, 

Charlestown, an Irish 
neighborhood in Boston that 
only covers one square mile, 
has alwa&gt;s had a lifestyle of 
its own. 

Codes of silence, rever- 
ence for the elderly and intol- 
erance for outsiders has 
alwa)'5 dotted the histor&gt;' of 
this small cit&gt;-within-a-ciiy. 
but the times have finally 



caught up with Charlestown. 

Thirtj-three &gt; ear old 
Bobb&gt; O'Gradj (played by 
Lear&gt;') is a full-time thief who 
indiscriminately steals every- 
thing one can think of. 

What he can't steal him- 
self, his childhood friends 
Red, Mouse and Digger and ' 
his cousin Seamus (who is 
still learning the trade) help 
him claim for his own. 

They are led by the 
charming Jackie O (played by 
Colm Meancy). whose charm 
and diplomatic personality 
hide the control freak mob- 
ster he really is. 

Things begin to get tense 
as one of them, suspected to 
be a police informant, is mur- 
dered by one of Jackie's men 
at a Charlestown bar. 

When the police come 
around, no one claims to 
have seen anything, despite 
how much they cared for 
their friend. 

The killing continues and 
Bobby watches his friends 
drop off one bj one while 
police detective Hanlon 



(played by Martin Sheen) is 
determined to get someone to 
talk. 

The more Hanlon investi- 
gates, the more Jackie kills 
and the more fed up Bobby 
becomes. 

Realizing that the killing 
must Slop before it gets to 
him, Bobby is given a choice: 
either break the code of 
silence and turn Jackie in or 
continue to watch his friends 
and relatives die. 

In the end, he comes to 
the conclusion to take mat- 
ters into his own hands and 
solve it his own wa&gt;'. 

"Monument Ave." is 
directed b&gt; Ted Demme, 
executive produced by 
Demme and Joel Stillerman 
and produced by Jim Serpico, 
with the screenplay written 
by Mike Armstrong. 

"Monument Ave." will be 
plajing at the Cinema Center 
Feb. 26 through March I.

Man with the Mike 



Baseball team to ready for successful season 



by Brian Miller. 
Sports Edilor 



[f &gt;ou look up "contender" in 
Webster's New World Thesaurus, you 
will find words such as "fighter." "war- 
rior." "soldier," "assailant," "bully" and 
"champion." 

All are adjectives that you could use 
to describe the men's Baseball team. 

Head Co^ch Tony Vittorio is very 
excited for the season to begin. 

His optimism about his team is one 
evco' fsn loves to hear. 

"I think the chemistr&gt;' is very close 
among our team." said Coach Vittorio. 
"The guys enjoy being around each 
other and that attitude and unit&gt;' can 
really help us throughout the season." 

Vittorio is a firm believer that 
"defense wins championships." and is 
proud that defense is the trademark of 
his program. 

As far as defense is concerned, 
Vittorio believes that pitching is the 
first, and most important, part of the 
defensive equation. 

"Although we don't have a solid 
number-one starter, I feel we are deeper 
this year," Vittorio said. "As a coach I 
will be able to play with the rotation, 
which will be a luxur&gt;' I have not had in 
the past." 

This season should be filled with 



many luxuries for the hard-nosed coach. 

The players dedicate a lot of time 
both on and off the field. 

Off the field, the baseball team 
helps by working at the Gates Sports 
Center and its games. 

On the field, the team is one of the 
best in the conference- a conference 
which was ranked second in the nation. 

"Our team has improved each year. 
I expect this year to be no different," 
Vittorio said. 

"We have some great players, none 
of which have shown the leadership of 
our four seniors," Vittorio added. 

The senior attack is compiled of 
stars such as Rico Martin, Bill Segerman, 
Dwayne Kuhn and Jason Glenn. 

"These four have dedicated their 
hearts and souls to the program, and 1 
think they're leadership is contagious," 
said Vittorio. 

"1 think we have a team full of lead- 
ers, and our chemistry is unbelievable 
this season," he added. 

The Dons start the season this 
Sunday in Tennessee. However, the 
schedule will not be an easy one, facing 
top 25 contenders this weekend like 
Wilmington, Lincoln National and 
Carson Newman. 

The road won't be a smooth one, 
but you can bet it will be well-traveled 
b&gt;' Vittorio and his boyi.

Man with the Mike 



IPFW says 'So long' 
to trio of talent 



by Brian Miller, 
Sports Edilof 



IPI-Wjus( said good bj'C to 
ihree of the most productive bas- 
ketball players in school histoo'. 

The women's team said 
goodbye to Katie Bruening, a 
solid leader. 

Bruening will leave scoring 
343 points and 251 rebounds in 
her t^vo-year career. 

She was aiso captain of the 
IPFW volleyball team and has 
been Academic All-Conference in 
both of her &gt;ears here at IPBV. 

John Williams and the men's 
basketball team will miss Adam 
Moore and Tyson Brit. 

Moore has been an icon with 
IPFW basketball. 

Brit, by far, is the most ath- 
letic player to come through the 
school, 

Moore will be leaving behind 



a record that has him scoring 854 
poinu, 327 field goals, 3G blocks 
and 389 rebounds. 

Moore is one of the all-time 
leaders in all Top-10 categories at 
IPFW. 

Brit, on the other hand, came 
here from Xavier Uni\'ersit&gt; and 
showed flashes of what he could 
do. 

He was a leader in his first 
season, and provided much 
excitement with his alley-oops. 

Although Brit's stats can be 
replaced, his excitement, talent 
and leadership will be hard to 
match. 

Both women's Coach Pam 
Bowden and men's Coach John 
Williams will try to recruit play- 
ers to fill the voids left by the 
trio. 

However, both coaches know 
it is a task that will not be easy to 
accomplish. 




Junior Steve Griffin goes up for a layup earlier 
Ifiis year. Griffin lead Ihe league in scoring wilh 
16.1 ppg. ^
