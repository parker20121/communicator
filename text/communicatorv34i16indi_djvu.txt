Omnibus lectures return Feb. 9 
with actor, writer B.D. Wong 



The Omnibus Lecture Series will 
return to IPFW Monday, Feb. 9, with a 
presentation from actor and author B.D. 
Wong. 

Wong's discussion, slated to take 
place at 7:30 p.m. that night in the Walb 
Union Ballroom, is titled "All the World's 
A Stage: Supporting the Transformation 
from Exclusion to Inclusion." 

Currently, he can be seen as the reoc- 
curing forensic psychiatrist character "Dr. 
Huang" on NBC's "Law and Order: 
Special Victim's Unit." 

He is considered best known for play- 
ing a Catholic priest named Father Ray 
Mukada on the controversial HBO series 
"Oz" set in a maximum security prison. 

According to a press release, the role 
was considered a breakthrough character 
for Wong, as he played the part of a 
"humane spiritual figure in the desperate 
and inhumane world of a maximum secu- 
rity prison." According to his biographv 
the role "has provided the actor with a 
stimulating platform for his diverse talent 
as well ^s tremendous exposure and popu- 
larity with an audience that includes an 
intense college-aged crowd," it says. 

He has also appeared in "The X- 



Files," "Sesame 
Street," "All- 
American Girl," 
"Chicago Hope" 

"And The Band 
Played On." 

In June 2003, 
his first book was 
released. The per-

The Omnibus Lecture Series consists 
ol speakers from a vanctv of backgrounds. 
So far during the 2003-2004 school year, 
writer P.J. O'Rourke, entertainer Ben 
Vereen and activist Winona LaDuke have 
spoke and authors Richard Rodriquez and 
Joyce Carol Oates are slated to speak.

"The difference 

between the two is I believe

Abortion debate: 
discussion or sermon? 

The abortion debate held by The Newman Group on campus was a nice concept, but 
not unite whal could be construed as a fair discussion of the topic. 

Scott Klusendorl ol Stand lo Reason had compelling arguments kn fighting against 
abortion procedures but klusendorl ga\ea pro-packaged speech and was quite nearly 
"preaching to the choir" of local anti-abortion activists. 

Catherine Voors - who stood for a woman's right to choose - admitted she was under- 
qualified to debate him. And that's where I he Newman Ciroup committed a bit of false 
advertising m fliers thev circulated on campus. 

They made it seem like two similarly skilled adversaries were going to discuss an 
ongoing controversy in the United States. Had they wanted to do' that', thev could have 
invited a nationally renowned activist lodis, nss the coot lasting opinions of Klusendorf 
Perhaps it would have been tougher lor klnscndoi l lo reconcile someone with more of an 
expertise in rhetoric on his level. 

Giving credit where it is due, klusendorf was immensely respectful to Voors. He might 
have been the same lo someone else who wanted to argue against him, bul nobody else 

■l" ! ~ "i on.- poison Jm iii ■ ill, debate i hallenged our concept tie had given Nobody 

asked him it women should be forced to have children against their will, or if they Should 
be forced to carry a tetus lo term in a case ol incest or rape. 

He railed against a government that helps funding of abortion clinics, saving his tax 
dollars should nt go to s U . h program-. - but one ol the tacts of life is our government uses 
our tax dollars tor a lot of things mdi\ iduals don't want or morally accent. Hippies hate 
lie m i hlar\, and \ el right now the majonlv ol the , on nl i \ has Jo, ided we need to fund 
the ..oiuepl ol a national defense. 

The debate was as easy for him as giving a lecture to a philosophy class. Except in phi- 
losophy, students are encouraged to ask the lough ouesiions. r r 
Its possible, in lact likely, thai klusendorl would have had what he believes are the 
right answers to every uucstioned lorwarded. 

Un both sides ol the abortion debate, the toughest questions are best left unasked - or a 
person might start to change their views. 

It's too bad the debate wasn't more of a balanced affair. It could have made 
Klusendorf s arguments much more compelling or put them in a more realistic light 



January is perhaps the longest month of the year. 

Technically, January has no more days than March or May. January is 
longer in the sense that it is a cold, slow, awful month for those of us who 
live in good old Fort Fun. 

January begins with a bad hangover from New Years and the abrupt 
beginning of school. The world has gone gray with dirty snow and a 
relentless {and seemingly endless) march of overcast, bitterly cold days. 
Take a peek out the window here at IPFW and you will see an entire stu- 
dent body shuffling heiwcen buildings, held down and arms crossed, 
desperately clinging lo their over-priced and impossibly heavy text 
books and praying to the Powers That Be that they don't step on a patch 
of ice and do a Charlie Brown-style back flop. The scene inside the class- 
room isn't any cheerier - your fellow students are either bent scoliosis- 
like over their notebooks, scribbling away as the professor drones on end- 
lessly, or have given up all will to live and are nothing more than gelati- 
nous meat popsjcles, niggling gently in their seats. 

Coming back from Christmas Hreak is alwavs ,i grisly event. The cam- 
pus, so lush and green in August, is a graveyard of tree skeletons and 
lumpy brown snow. The parking garages become huge cement fortresses 
of lurking doom and the classrooms become our own personal holding 
cells. Fifty-minute courses go from fun and short to unbearably long and 
dull. Attending eighty-minute classes is suddenly considered sado- 
masochism. The homework and the snow are piling up, you're forgetting 
what the sun looks like, and May might as well be fifty years away. 

To top it all off, the Canada geese are still hanging around on campus. 



pooping everywhi 

But don't worry, all is : 
ary.) We've only got 



lost. January is almost over (yes, it's still 

more days to go, and then we're into 

pring again, and then : 



Pretty 
Remember summer? Remember when the trees had leaves, and the 
was out every day, and you wished desperately that il would be just a lit- 
tle bit cooler outside? Remember when it was 98 degrees outside with 
100% humidity and you could have basically swam from class to class? 
Granted; the summer extreme is better than the winter, but il is consider- 
ably more sticky. Are" you so eager to return to the days of sandy shorts 
and 3 rd degree sunburns? 

Appreciate the winter while it's here. There are few things more beau- 
tiful than a fresh snowfall or a tree coated entirely in ice or more enter- 
taining than catching a snowflake on your tongue or sliding down a hill 
on your butt. . Build a snowman using real coal pieces and a carrot. Make 
snow angels right along with your children. Go ice-skating, get into a 
snowball fight, buy a sled and reclaim all those childhood pastimes that 
you have forgotten. They haven't lost their fun because you grew up. 
Spend the day outside in the snow, and spend the night inside next to a 
fire, drinking hot chocolate and playing games. The holiday spirit only 
dies if you let it: this year, make a resolution to keep celebrating life, even 
though the calendar doesn't give you a good reason to do so.

Not any more, 
Mr. Rentfrow 



Mr. Rentfrow, is life so lonely and bor- 
ing that you have nothing better to do 
than to sit on your pedestal and make 
cheap shots at people who don't sub- 
scribe to your philosophic? That seems 
easy to do when you're hiding behind an 
"opinions" page. You've used the 
Opinions page of The Communicator as 
your own personal forum to announce to 
the world what an elitist you are. Here's 
a little info for you, Mr. Rentfrow ... just 
because people are different from you in 
the way they look, act and believe does 
not make them substandard to you. It's 
easy to write editorials and give your 
two-cents worth. Here's an idea, Justin, 
why not write something truly newswor- 
thy? Your writing level isn't what 1 
would expect from a college student. I've 
read far better articles from high school 
publications. You'\ e even described your 
own writing as "horrible ... I threw it 
together at the last minute." 

Be that as it may, your opinions are 
your own, and you have a right to 
express them. But when you are starting 
to pass false statements off as facts, you 
trudge into a whole new arena. It's called 
libel, Mr. Rentfrow. Perhaps that's some- 
thing you should research. But since The 
Communicator seems hell-bent on keep- 
ing you around, perhaps it's something 
your editors should research too. With 
that said, let's dissect your last two "arti- 
cles,'' shall we? 

You say the Young Republicans are a 
favorite organization of yours. You 
wrote, "Not only will a member of this 
group learn solid morals, but the concept 
of individual responsibility." This is a 
good example ol .in opinion My opinion 
is that politicians in general (be it 
Republican or Democrat) have never 
been that good at exhibiting solid morals, 
nor do they accept individual responsi- 
bility often. See, another good example 
of an opinion. Oh, and my bumper stick- 
er says nothing of being a "born again 
Pagan." Mine reads, "I'm Pagan and I 
vote." Yes, 1 do my part to try .to keep 
Republicans (young and old) out of 
office, the only Republican I would ever 
vote for would be Dr. Cerr\ Miller 'cause 
she's one feisty chick (but I wasn't able to 
get her to run for president). 

You also tell students that they should 
remember to bring God, Jehovah or 
Allah along with them to school. I agree 
with you on this opinion. But you should 
remember that there are numerous 
deities throughout the world that people 
worship. Are you so narrow minded that 
you truly believe you will come to col- 
lege and not meet someone who actually 
worships one ol these numerous other 
deities? And what right do you have to 
judge them on their religious beliefs? No 
one has tied you up and forced you to 
attend a "bovine sacrifice," have they? 
(By the way, 1 do have a sense of humor 
and I did get a chuckle out of that joke. It 
reminded me of the one I heard about 
Christians sacrificing lambs at Easter ... 
hmmm, might have to look that one up, 

You call Pagans "religiously stunted." 
You say we want religion on our own 
terms and that we don't want our per- 
sonal morality "constricted and confined 
by the covenants and teachings of the 
mainstream religions" and therefore we 
can do whatever we want "no guilt 
included." I'm not sure that was an opin- 
ion. It read as though you were trying to 
pass that off as a fact. Well, the fact is 
that, no, we don't hold to the covenants 
and teachings of mainstream religions. 
Ours is a nature based, matriarchal reli- 
gion that is far older than Christianity. 
Agricultural societies throughout Europe 
worshipped a Goddess to ensure health 
and good crops. They saw women as 
mystical and powerful due to the process 
of pregnancy and birth (which they did 
not scientifically understand at the time) 
Do we believe in the Ten 
Commandments? No, we follow one law 
. . . "As it harms none, do what ye will." It 
sounds simple, yet is all encompassing. 
People will read that and think that 
Pagans do what they will, whatever they 
want. That's simply not true. That's due 
to the part that says, "As it harms none." 
That includes other people, animals, the 
planet and one's self. Is it followed all the 
time? No, like you said, no one is perfect. 
I smoke cigarettes; therefore I am harm- 
ing myself and not following our rule to 
the T. But I am teaching my 3-year-old 
son to be considerate of other's feeling 
and to respect life in all forms. And, like 
you, Mr. Rentfrow, Pagans have to live 
by the laws established by society. We 
may not use fear tactics such as hellfire 
and damnation to keep others in line, but 






And for the love of Pete, Justin, where 
did you get the idea that Pagans believe 
that the Gods were created in the image 
of man? I can't believe you even attempt- 
ed to pass that off as fact. Have you never 
even spoken to a Pagan before? The fact 
is, we believe (as do most religions) that 
the Divine (by whatever name you want 
to call him or her) created human life; all 
life as a matter of fact. The Goddess gave 
birth to the moon, stars and planets. She 
breathed life onto this planet, thereby 
being the Divine Mother of us all. You 
know her as Mother Nature. I know her 
as the Great Goddess. It's true that dur- 
ing some rituals, a priest or priestess 
invokes the God or Goddess, and it is 
believed at that point that the deity takes 
on that human form. Is that what you 
were referring to, Mr. Rentfrow? Maybe 
you're just confused; it's okay, sweetie. 

Do you realize, Mr. Rentfrow, that the 
first Fort Wayne Pagan Pride Day was 
held this past September on your own 
campus? There was a designated area for 
protestors and demonstrators. Where 
were you? If you feel as strongly as you 
do, shouldn't you have made a stand 
against a group that is "simply taking an 
easy way out? ' 

I want to personally invite you to the 
2004 FW Pagan Pride Day next 
September, Justin. We'll even let you 
bring a copy of The Communicator with 
you. You can open it to the Opinions 
page and spout your narrow-minded, 
hate filled rhetoric from behind it if that 
is what you wish. 

Now, I'm not even going to get into 
your comments on the gay community. 
As a married, heterosexual woman, I'm 
no authority on the homosexual lifestyle. 
{I have come to find gay men make 
derful friends for women.) All I ca 

your comments disgusted 



grow up in such a sheltered world. You 
know, I have seen numerous heterosexu- 
al couples kissing and groping in public. 
How is that any less a statement about 
their sexuality than what the gay com- 
munity does? (Except the gay communi- 
ty does it in a much more tasteful fashion 
... no pun intended). 

As far as The Communicator goes, 
Editor in Chief, Scott Lawson claims 
Rentrfrow is not on the staff of the paper. 
But, in Rentfrow's "Nudge" article, his 
byline states he's a staff columnist. In his 
"AH Apologies" article, his byline reads 
"columnist." But, when David Hunter 
wrote to The Communicator concerning 
Rentfrow, he was clearly described as a 
"guest columnist." So, what exactly is 
Rentfrow if he's not a guest columnist, 



selves from Justin a little? 

When asked what criteria would be 
used to determine what Rentfrow would 
write in the opinions column, Mr. 
Lawson is quoted as saying, "Basically, 
he said he was writing about his apolo- 

E; instead what he gave me had a dif- 
ent slant than what I expected. Still, 
the purpose of an opinion column is to 
generate dialogue, but also sometimes 
we don't have much to choose from." So, 
because The Communicator doesn't have 
much ta choose from, they choose to fill 
it with trash. Well, Mr. Lawson, you now 
have sornething to print other than Justin 
Rentfrow's "writings." That is very sad. 
Whafs next? Here's an idea ... the next 
rime material is few and far between; 
give Justin free reign over that issue. 
Yeah, you can re-name it "Rentfrow's 
Ramblings." It's only a matter of time 
before he starts putting down other 
groups since he has proven that anyone 
different from him and open season. 
What will your paper do when he starts 
whining because there's no white history 
month? Do your advertisers know that 
you're alienating many of your readers 
by promoting Rentfrow's hate literature? 
Maybe they should. They might not like 
to be associated with such a paper. 

Okay, I think I'm done. But, before I 
step off my soapbox, let me address one 
more thing for Mr. Rentfrow. 

Pagans aren't attempting to legitimize 
their religion; it is a legitimate religion. 
As a matter of fact, ifs a government- 
sanctioned religion. That means legally, 
we're just as legitimate as your neighbor- 
hood church (minus the whole sex scan- 
dal thing). 

We are not all minimum wage workers; 
we are lawyers, doctors, teachers, etc. We 
are also parents; teaching the next gener- 
ation to be open-minded, kind-hearted, 
free thinkers. That must scare they hell 
out of you, Mr. Rentfrow. We vote, and 
Goddess worship is growing by leaps 



Ladies, don't read between the 
lines: there's not much there 



Did you know that there are hidden mes- 
sages in what emails you receive from the men 
in your life? How about the fact that the gifts 
you get from him on a certain looming, corpo- 
rate-inspired holiday convey deep messages 
that he s maybe just too afraid to admit to. 
Well, I should send my condolences to 
Cosmopolitan. They've been grossly misin- 
formed. 

Men, when it comes to the messages that 
they are supposedly are sending, are about as 
deep as the new Atkins wraps from Subway. 

I do want to apologize to the man out there 
reading this column that actually puts hidden 
messages into his gifts. I feel for you, dear 
Romeo.. I understand how much it must irri- 
tate you to stand there, in the red-laden, heart- 
filled, chocolate covered Valentine's Day aisle 
at the local Walgreens, spending hours on end 
debating whether the stuffed monkey or the 
stuffed puppy best conveys your intent. I can 
see where the wrong choice will make your 
significant other misunderstand your true, 
heartfelt emotions. 

It's a monkey, for craps sake. 

I don't know how to tell you people this, but 
to all of you female readers, you've been gross- 
ly misinformed, Put down your 
Cosmopolitans (the magazine, not the drink- 
feel free to keep hold of that), the Glamours, 
and the Seventeen's. They will do nothing 
but cause you misery, heartache, and hours of 
debating the true meaning behind the fact that 
he gives you a dozen roses from the best florist 
in town, and not a bouquet from the checkout 
lane at the local grocery store. 

Honey, it's entirely possible he's just showing 
off his pucketbook because that's the only 
thing he s got. I'd rather take a walk through 
the park, hand-in-hand, under the stars than 
some $30.00 bouquet of roses. If you insist on 
flowers, carnations are even better than the 
roses. They usually last longer and I know 
he's not taken in a debt so large that it makes 
his student loans look like pocket change. 

In this same magazine, which shall remain 
unnamed, we are taught how to read what he 
really says in each email he sends. The longer 
his email is, the more "he digs you." But, be 
warned, if it's error-free, he's rigid, and if it's a 



long text without breaks, he's inconsiderate 
The shorter the email is, the more he's display- 
ing that he's not ready to get too close. 

Wonderful. Another way to get women in 
this country obsessed with size. 

The fact is, you could get a self-centered and 
verbose man that will write you pages upon 
pages. It has nothing to do with how much he 
feels for you, but rather how much he feels for 
himself. A so ft -spoken, gentle-spirited, and 
easygoing English major would certainly be 
likely to send you an email that contained' few 
to zero errors. Certainly not the next in line to 
be a dictator. I don't know about you girls, 
but I like a guy that knows that str8 and 
straight aren't the same, and that im is what 
you do online and I'm means I am, 

I'd also rather have a three sentence long 
email that says, "I'm going to class. I'll call 
you later tonight. I love you" than a page and 
halt about lunch. 

Size is not important, it's how you utilize it. 
Take heart, ladies, I am one of you. I'm 
incredibly guilty of analyzing the men in my 
life. There isn't one of us that is guiltless in 
this area. It's a gender-based problem that 
stems from the fact that we put messages into 
what we do. 

We, who spend hours agonizing over what 



iternally, and even with other females, about 
how the short, tight dress screams "skank" 
and the long dress says "prude." We make 
ourselves miserable Irving to decide the mes- 
sage we want to send, and then discover the 
outfit that conveys it the best 

Take that time and spend it on something 
better, like enjoying the fact that you have a 
man in your life. 

The fact is that wearing what you feel com- 
fortable in will create self-confidence, and 
that's what the men will notice. Self-confi- 
dence is more attractive than a skintight, short- 
skirted, cleavage-baring ensemble, any day. 
Most men won t recognize the fact that you're 
wearing the same dress thai you wore the 
night you two had your first kiss. He's going 
to notice that you're comfortable with yourself 
and with him, and that's what's going to make 
you both happy. 



him a freaking Kleenex and say, "Oless you." 



Second semester: short on 
time, long on homework 



Of course, the teacher always collects the 
homework when you forget to complete your 
assignment. A researcher should do a study on 
the clairvoyant abilities of instructors to sense 
when students have not completed their 
assignments. 

The limitations of our memory is exposed 
during these mind blanks, because it is only 
when class starts do you remember your 
homework faux pas. At first, you search for 
your paper in the cavernous expanse of your 
book bag; every pocket and folder is checked. 



If IPFW offered a degree in worrying, I 
would already have a Ph. D; in fact, I would 
already be head of the Anxiety department 
and I would be writing my seventh book on 
the subject. 

The start of the new semester brings with it 
many time honored traditions: the greatest of 
these is stress. After an incredibly long vaca- 
; back to school only to be inun- 

!. W( 

r schedule and find the classes 
take and the classes we have to take; our lives 
become even more hectic as we have to learn 
all over again how to balance our schedule 
with our school and our homework with our 
housework. 

And during these first few weeks, it isn't 

"3. 



textbooks. Armed with pens, pencils and i 
books, we promise ourselves that this time, we 
will make it to class — for the first week any- 

Lest anyone say that money never did any- 
thing good for anyone, I can testify from per- 
sonal experience that my good attendance to 
class is partially due to the exorbitant prices I 
paid for my textbooks; if I paid for it, then I am 
going to use it. 

However, the resentment evoked from the 
outrageous book prices is understandable. 
Perhaps the greatest surprise, given a stu- 
dent's perennial encounter with the item, is 
concept of homework: 

"Are you telling me I have to drag myself out 
of bed to get to school AND THEN do work 
outside of class? And the teacher is going to 
collect it for a GRADE?" 

Despite the fact we all have many years of 
experience with homework, the overwhelm- 
ing amount of assignments as soon as we 
arrive back from break is still a shock. And 
after the initial stun of increased responsibility 
wears off, the games begin. 

"I don't need to do my homework tonight, 
the teacher isn't going to collect it anyway. ' 



pray to God and promise a life of servitude if 
only you could oe spared this one time-it 
won't happen again, you promise. 

Of course, most often these prayers go unan- 
swered and you face purgatory in extra credit 
to redeem your grade. In fact, I have only won 
at what I call "Homework Roulette" three or 
four times in my entire career as a student. 

But forgetting your homework is just one of 
the myriad ways that things go wrong during 
your time on campus. To complete the tri- 
umvirate of sources that generate early semes- 
ter strain, it is necessary to mention yet anoth- 
er favorite ritual of the student (perhaps my 
favorite of all): running late. 

I can only imagine what if is like to be early 
for a class-more than once. Usually, I barely 
make it, and on more than one occasion I have 
arrived in class out of breath from running. I 
sneak in the back door, feeling chagrined as I 
desperately look for a seat after the teacher has 
already begun his or her lecture. 

I would argue with anyone who thinks our 
campus is too small-try getting from Kettler 
Hall to Williams Theatre consistently in less 
than ten minutes (with a book bag I have man- 
aged to travel the expanse in under eight min- 
utes). 

Yet as I reflect back on these far too familiar 
events I realize that only the price of textbooks 
is beyond my control. I create all of my foolish 
excuses to postpone my homework indefinite- 
ly, and no one other than me lets me sleep in 
the extra half-hour in the morning when 1 do 
not really have the time. 
Well, that revelation is certainly something to

fluffy movies like Along (. ante I'ollv" and insipid 
action flicks like "Paycheck" and 'Torque". It is

those movies is currently in theaters.

Band tests limits of punk on first album 



munity. 

It's amazing now one 
word can spark such a 
plethora or questions. 
And perhaps the greatest 
question is that of — "what 
makes a band punk?" 

It seems that every- 
one has an opinion on this 
topic, yet no one can truly 
answer it. So what do you 
do? Well, if you're Fall Out 
Boy, made up of Peter 
Wentz (guitar, vocals), 
Andrew Hurley (drums), 
Patrick Stump (vocals) and 
Joseph Trohman (guitar), 
you simply invent your 
own genre within the cons

1 Now I'm no expert on 
"soft-core punk," hut I do know that fall 
Out Boy's first full length alburn "Take 
this to your Grave," is chock full of 

i|iiK'k-p.Ked, catchy, vigorous tunes that 
will leave listeners reaching for the 
repeat button at their conclusion. 

Fall Out Boy was brought to life a 
little over one year ago but it wasn't 
superhero power-, thai got them to where 
they are tod.iv The Chicago based band 
lormed after Wentz, front man of venera- 
ble hardcore troop Arma A nge I u s

good friend and guitarist Trohman and 
began writing pop songs for fun. The 
dynamic duo -tumbled upon the charis- 
ma tic Stump, and without ado Stump 
lound hi nisei I a-, the vocalist of the newly 



friend Hurley. 

But my favorite aspect of this album 
isn't its sound (but it's good too) but 



The first track off the album, "Tell 
it Mick He Just 
things to Do Today," 
ahead with heavy guitar riffs and a 
plethora of hard drum beats. The vocal's 
also make this track top dog on the disc. 
Wentz sounds straight like The Starting 
Line's Kenny Vasoli. And no kids, that is 
not a bad thing. 

The other stand out track of the 
album is "Chicago is so Two Years Ago." 
Nothing stands out more on any albui 



emotional about 
than just about anything else (i.e. 
Allister's "Somewhere down on 

Fullerton.") 

Overall the disc pounds home the 
strong vibe of today's punk genre. Be it 
hard, soft, pop or some other generic sub 
genre, Fall Out Boy is prone to be 2004's 
Good Charlotte by being the breakout 
band of the year. 

They simply are that good. 

Looking for the soundtrack to early 
adult life, I strongly suggest giving "Take

TODAY'S TOPIC: RAVE'S DOMINATION 



According to a recent article in 
the journal Gazette, North Carolina- 
based American Screen announced 
plans to open a new movie complex in 
the place of Coventry 13 Theater, locat- 
ed in the Village of Coventry The new 
theater will feature wall-to-wall 
screens with stadium seating. New 
foods will be offered that are not regu- 
larly offered in movie theaters, like- 
gourmet pizza, buffalo wings and 
Philadephia steak and cheese sand- 
wiches. A coffee bar will be available 

As an average moviegoer who i: 



It's about damn time. 

The monopoly of Rave Motion 
Pictures has gone on for too long. This 
end to their domination is long over- 
due. If you are unfamiliar with the 
tyranny that is Rave, let me break 
down their evil ways one by one. 

First issue: Parking. Anyone who 
has tried to park at Rave can attest to 
the fact that it is damn near impossible 
to do so. First off, rarely does i 



to the theater that the online service is 
not offered during the week. Then 
why did they let me buy them over the 
Internet?! I had to get my more-expen- 
sive internet tickets through the regu- 
lar box office. So I paid extra to wait in 
line with everyone else. (I know that 
recently they added the outdoor all 
day credit card ticket pick up, so this 
issue is a bit obsolete. But I'm still 
pissed about the $1.50 they stole from 
me. Hey, I could have bought a few 
kernels of popcorn at the snack bar 
wilh that scratch.) 

I'm sure plenty of angry movie- 
goers have the same complaints to say 
about Rave, and I'm sure the Rave is 
aware of our unhappiness. But why 
would they do anything about it? For 
three years they have had the Fort 
Wayne movie theater scene on lock- 
down by being Ihe only stadium-seat- 
ing theater in town. Many times I have 
been so pissed off at Rave's atrocities 
that I have threatened never to go 
but I quickly shut up when I

called Dupont Cinema Center, will

cially enticing for those of us who have 
to bear the twenty minute drive on the

seeing a movie. No longer will \

Spikers off to hot start 



By IPFW News Services 
The IPFW men's volley- 
bait team began the 2004 sea- 
son, answering a few ques- 
tions, and getting win num- 
ber one on the season, 3-1 
over the Scarlet Raiders of 
Rutgers- Newark, Friday 
night, Jan. 16, at the Hilliard 



first home match after the 
passing of equipment manag- 
er Tony Laux last week. After 
a touching pre-game tribute, 
the 'Dons got after it right 
away on the way to a 30-24, 
30-26, 23-30, 30-27 win. 

Also, IPFW needed to 
know if the left outside hit- 
ting position would be a 



weakness. ..not on this night. 
Freshman Josh Collins was 
strong in his first game with 
the Mastodons, going 9-13 for 
a hitting percentage of .615. 

Senior Matt Zbyszewski 
stole the show with a match- 
high 34 kills to go along with 
a slugging percentage of .537. 

Junior setter Dennis 
Santiago registered a double- 
double for the 'Dons with 53 
assists and 13 digs. 

Senior Isaac White also 
hit double figures in digs 

Playing in front of a rau- 
cous crowd at the Memorial 
Coliseum, the IPFW men's 
volleyball raised their record 
to 2-0, with a 3-0 win over 
George Mason University on 
Saturday night. 



Amie's Army jumped on 
the Patriots from the opening 
serve and didn't let up. The 
Mastodons swept the match 
by the scores of 30-16, 30-28, 
and 35-33. 

IPFW was led again by 
outside right Matt 

Zbyszewski who put down 
22 kills. Zbyszewski also had 
four assists and eight digs. 

Junior setter Dennis 
Santiago posted 39 assists 
and four digs of his own in 
the match. 

As a team, IPFW out- 
slugged George Mason (0-2) 



Sikca and Mike Daiga 
anchored the 'Dons' defen- 
sive effort with eight and

Women open 
it up on 
Chicago St. 



Glancing at the final point 
total for the IPFW women's bas- 
ketball team on Monday, Jan. 19, 
one would probably never guess 
that the team scored just five 
points in the first six and a half 
minutes. The Mastodon women 
finished the game with 84 points, 
scoring 53 of them in the second 
half of the contest and defeating 
the Chicago St. Cougars. 

The opening minutes were 
marred with careless turnovers, 
missed open shots and bad 
defense. 

Enter Geneva Murdock. 

The forward ignited the 
Mastodons when she came off the 



Chi

nter: 



and pulling down a few key defen- 
sive rebounds. She finished with 
12 points and eight rebounds. 

The first half continued with 
IPFW and Chicago St. hading bas- 
kets. Kelly Boyd made a layup at 
the 4:07 mark to give IPFW its first 
lead, but just 24 seconds later; the 
Cougars took it right back 



31. 

The Mastodons picked up 
where Gearlds left of in the first 
half, with forward Courtney 
Nicley hitting a 3-pointer and cen- 
ter Verea Bibbs scoring four quick 
points off of key offensive 
rebounding. 

After scoring just five points 
in the first half, Gearlds caught fire 
and scored 20 in the second. She 
hit a key 3-pointer with a shade 
under 10 minutes remaining, giv- 
ing the Mastodons their first dou- 
ble-digit lead of the game. 

The lead never got to single 
digits again, as IPFW was able to 
open up the floor and run a transi- 
tion offense, wearing down the 
Cougars. 

After shooting just 33 percent 
from the field in the first half, 
IPFW turnedthe tide and made 
54.5 percent of its shots in the sec- 
ond half. The team also connected 
on eight of 18 3-pointers, a 44.4 
percentile. 

IPFW was led with 25 points 
from Amy Gearlds along with 22 
points and 10 rebounds from Verea 
Bibbs. Ashley Johnson and 
Courtney Nicley chipped in seven 
a piece. Kafayat Davies scored 20 
points for Chicago St. 

IPFW's next home game is 
Thursday, Jan. 22 against 
Wisconsin-Green Bay at the Gates 
Center at 7 p.m.

Student athletes honored for GPAs 



By IPFW News Services 

Twenty-one IPFW student-ath- 
letes recorded perfect 4.0 grades point 
averages for the just completed 2003 fall 
semester. 

The overall Grade Point Average 



campus GPA of 2.81. The Women's GPA 
was 3.06, while the Men's was 2.86. 

" Athletics' emphasis on academ- 
ic achievement continues to prove suc- 



challenge to our Student- 
Athletes to achieve a 3.0 GPA for the 
^pnn.s; bL'mester." 

In a unique accomplishment, 
both Tennis teams (Men's - 3.23 and 
Women's - 3.52) achieved the highest 
GPAs in the Department. 

"My sincere congratulations to 
Coach Eric Burns for this remarkable 
accomplishment," said Athletic Director 
Mark Pope. "Despite coaching two teams 



and competing in more than 20 matches 
this Fall, Coach Bums kept his teams 
focused on the reason why they are 
enrolled at IPFW. I'm very proud of him." 
103 of IPFW's 200 Student- 
Athletes achieved a "B" (3.0) average or

he has a penchant for trying to

"He is exciting," Ball said 
with a smile. "He makes too 
many mistakes, but he is get- 
ting better. He'll do some 
things, and you'll just sit back 
and go." 

The right side belongs to 
senior opposite hitter 
Zbyszewski, who was ranked 
second behind Ptak in kills 
with 370 last season. He was 
also named to the M1VA All- 
Conference Second Team.

left side, and if that doesn't change, it will 
make it a very difficult season," Ball 

At the satter position is Santiago,

Rico, who registered 1,022 assists in 2003, 



Sophomore Serdar Sikca 
is the anchor in the middle. 
Sikca tallied 122 total blocks 

for IPFW in 2003. He also had a hitting 
percentage of .377. 

"Serdar is very athletic with a lot of 
international experience, so that is a solid 
spot for us," Ball said. 

Coach Ball will be looking to a num- 
ber of players to step up and take control 
of the left side. 

"Mitch (Dreisbach), Nick (Belman), or 
Issac (White) could play there. So the sixth 
-.pot is the one we are not sure about," said 
Ball. 




son. Now in his senior year, Sherman is 
looking to provide a great deal of help to 
his team, after playing in a career low 15 
matches in 2003. 

The returnees also include sopho- 
more Mike Daiga, who will play the mid- 
dle. Though not a natural position for 
Daiga, Coach Ball feels that he has the 
"right si/ t &gt; and work ethic." 

The ream will also be joined by soph- 
omore Jason Morgan, who did not partici- 
pate last season after playing in 14 match- 
es m 21X12. Also joining Ihe squad is Mike 
Randolph, a transfer from Missouri Valley 
College. 

In addition, last year's recruiting 
class has added Trevor Newman, who was 
All-Con terence tor Micldleton High School 
in Middleton, Wisconsin last year and 
Jerrod Quillen, an Outside Hitter from 
Lagrange, Ohio. 

Also, freshman Cristiano Moreira 
joined the squad at the beginnii 
January just previous to the start of the 
season. Tht b'4" Outside Hitter is from 
Belo Horizante, Brazil, the same city that 
produced women's volleyball standout 
Fabiana Souza. 

"I think this group has the potential to 
push the other teams in this conference," 
Ball said. "Ohio State will be good, Lewis 
University (2003 National Champions,) 
has all of their people back, but if we get 
all of our people in place, we'll push those
