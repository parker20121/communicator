BySCOTWESNER 
Stall Writer 

A concern lor the safety of 
pcdesbTaiB Crossing E, Campus Dr. 
will result In two changes over Ihe 
semester break. Feb, 21 and 22. 

Signs on E. tZampus Dr. and around 
campus caution motorists to yield U 



"Studei 



la seem to be following the 
vehicle regulations, it's the 
trying to shorlcul from

lirector al Ibe physical 
plant, "It is questionable how olten 
thislawisobeyed." 

The Universlly Resources Pdlcy 
Committee, made up of students, 
faculty and adnunistratoTS, studies 
campus needs and recommends 
needed improvements. In the case Of 
pedeslnan safely on E. Campus Dr., 
two changes were recommended : 

1. Install a four-way stop al the 
corner of Red Dr. and E. Campus Dr. 

2. Eliminate south exit of lot 6 onto 
E. (!^mpusDr. 

Kattcr said. '■These changes will not 
only slow- Irafric on E Campus Dr.. 



portunlty to ci 
slow traffic ej 
and E. Cam[ 



it will also help lo 




Coliseum Blvd to Si Joe Rd. that 
speed most. We hope this slows them 
down, or encourages them to go 
around the campus " 

were decided upon by the U.H.P 
Committee These changes will take 
place during Hie summer to avoid 
snarling traffic. 



nl turn la

turn lane will begin at the pedcsfflan 
crosswalk by lot to. Three curbs will 
also tie cut back lo allow molcrlsis 
easier turning 

Hotter exploined the ctmer by Ihc 
flag pole in front of KetUer Hall will be 
cut to allow motorist to pass people

Closing a wise decision 



The admlnlslration made a wise 
decision last Tuesday. Early thai 
morning, the administration decided la 
allow the students to stay safely at homo 
by closInK school. 

Hoads were icy and haiardous This 
caused problems not only In dnving but 
also In the simple function of walking. 
The sidewalks were so ley one fool in 
Ironl of the other turned into one slide in 
front of the other. 

This la nn improvement from the poor 
decision made by the adminislratlon 
Jon. 21. Although roads and sidewalks 
were not hazardous that day, sulvzero 
IcmperBlures caused danger for anyone 
outdoors. 

We feel II Is more Important For 
students to be kept alive then for 
nludenls to attend classes Surely, Ihe 



administration realizes thai many 
sludenLs enrolled at IPPW are from Ihe 
oultying counties. Roads and weather 
conditions arc usually poorer in these 
counties than in the Immediate area. 
Students in these areas usually do not 
make it in to schools on days such as 
Tuesday. And then, they miss lectures 
and tests. 

This IS un/pir. Those students are 
paying for classes just as everyone else 
Is, They should not have lo miss class 
due to weahlcr and the administration's 
poor decision making. 

Once again we would like lo commend 
the adminislrsllon lor their fine 
decision. And wc would like lo Ihank 
them lor being fair about letting all 
students get what they have paid for.

No hurrah: cheerleaders 



Lost Saturday. IPFW men's and 
women's buskctlmll teams had their 
biggest games of the season so far. Both 
teams were challenging Lewis 
University, u team (hat leads Iwlh men's 
and women's conference standings. 

At the oftemoan women's game, 
IPFW cheerleaders apparently decided 
the game was not worthy of their 
presence The game was a bailie for first 
place, but Ihe cheerleaders were absent 
from Ihe contest. 



For (he evening men's game, the 
cheerleaders apparently got up Ihe 
energy to cheer. 'Hie men's game was an 
Important one as well. 

Where were you. cheerleaders, when 
Ihc women's teams were fighting for the 
lop conference spot? If you are unable or 
unwilling to cheer and support all IPFW 
teams, then why cheer at all? 

Given Ihe importance of the women's 
game, the absence is unexcusable.

FRIDAY- 7:30 p,m, 

THE GARDEN OF DELIGHTS is a complex and brilliantly funny 
film which focuses on a millionaire industrialist who suffers amnesia 
as the result of an auto accident. His greedy family elaborately re- 
stages events from his past In an attempt to jolt him Into remember- 
ing the number of his Swiss bank account. 

Director Carlos Sauia's quicksitver styie enabled him to make cogent 
comments about the Spanish regime while avoiding govemmeni 
censorship, as THE GARDEN OF DELIGHTS is a obvious criticism 
of the realities of Franco's Spain, Saura is a strong contender as the 
most important Spanish filmmaker after Bunuel. (Spain, 1970 - 99 
minutes) 



SATURDAY -2:00 pm. 

THE EMPORER JONES ■ From the play by Eugene OT^eill. who 
requested that Paul Robeson play the strong-willed Pullman porter 

who becomes a Jamaican king. This highly successful and powerful 
adaptation of O'Neill's brilliant play helped pave the way for more 
positive black screen roles. (72 minutes)
