Computer viruses infect campus 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
News Editor 

They are mysteriously invented, on a 
mission to replicate and are 
continually causing infection 
Computer viruses are present and creating 
damage to several IPFW computer systems. 

Recently, consultants of computer and 
data services discovered four viruses on the 
computers located in the Financial Aid 
Office in KetUer Hall, Room 109. Several 
consultants feel Lhat many computer users 
may not be educated in the techniques of 
preventing virus-caused malfunctions. 
Without this knowledge, students and 
faculty may be infecting other computers 
with the viruses they receive on campus 

"The area we've been having problems 
with is the faculty software: they use bard 
drives all the tune," said Mary Scboeler, 
manager of user support. "Viruses can enter 
hard drives very easily." 

Computer viruses have a number of 
effects Viruses can cause a computer to lock 
up. Plus, a computer may often erase, 
rearrange and hide files. 

"Viruses frequently get into computer 
files," said Emily Merkler, a computing and 
data services help desk consultant. "When 
students execute these files, it causes the 
files to lock-up." 

Viruses have three central features. Fust, 
a virus can replicate itself to spread 
throughout a computer system 

Second, a virus cannot replicate 
independently A virus requires some form 
of earner (disk, files, etc) to transpon it 
from place to place. 



Third, a functional definition of a 
compuier virus includes the fact that it 
creates malfunctions inadvertently or 
deliberately Simply, the vims causes 
problems as a reaction of someone 
executing iL 

"They (viruses) arc always around." said 
Merkler. "Students just need to keep an eye 
out forihem." 

Many experiences with vims infections 
are found months after a 
vims affects software. Once 
a problem is found, a 
computer user often 
interprets it as a hard drive 
error, and the drive is 
reformatted, erasing the 
virus. The primary issue 
in virus management is 
recognition Users must first 
fmd the vims in order to 
eliminate it. 

"The viruses usually 
come in through the 
Internet," said Schoeler "If 
students download 
information from the 
Internet they need to be 
cautious" 

There are a few anti-viral 
programs that can aid users 
in identifying and destroying 
viruses. Such programs are 
activity monitors, change 
detection software, operation 
restricting software, 
encrypting software and. 
most commonly, scanners 
Activity monitors. 



change detection software, operation 
restricting software and encrypting software 
simply watch for any "suspicious" activity. 
These programs ask for confirmation when 
any alterations are done on a file. Their 
procedures can take place while the user is 
actively working on their computer. While 
these types of programs work in different 
ways, all of them locale nearly the same 
things. 



On the other hand, scanning software 
scans a disk or file for any viruses without 
interrupting the user's work. While scanners 
do not get rid of the vims, they can help 
locale them. 

"Students should frequently scan their 
systems for viruses before downloading 
items." said Merkler. 

As a result of the virus spotlings, 
consultants arc asking studenis and faculty 



to scan their software for viruses. Students 
questioning the use of the scanning software 
or those who locate a virus should call the 
help desk, at 481-6030. 

"Even though it is a common problem, 
there is an ongoing need to scan," said 
Schoeler. "If studenis land faculty) don't 
have the software, they should check their 
disks." 



Program offers 

information 

to migraine sufferers 




IPFW students could unknowingly be transmitting computer viruses. 



by Shannon Kin tun 
CMef Reporter 

Migraines.. .What they are, 
what triggers ibem, and how to 
treat ihem. Students who seem to 
be missing out on life as a result of 
their migraines now have a chance 
to receive medical advice. 
Anything and everything migraine 
sufferers wanted to know will soon 
be at their fingertips. 

The IPFW Wellness Council 
and IPFW Athletics are bringing an 
educational and informational 
program to studenis. Two lecturers 
will be speakiDg about their 
experiences with migraines and 
ways to prevent them. 

On Tuesday. Dec. 10, at 12 p.m. 
speaking on behalf of all migraine 
sufferers, Sally Quake, R.N.- 
retired, formally of Fort Wayne 
Neurology, will speak of her 
experiences of being a lifetime 
migraine sufferer The lecture will 
be held in the Gates Sports Center. 
Room 104. 

Quake has had first-hand 
experience with die migraines. She 
has also worked with a number of 
patients in her many years in the 
medical field. 

Anthony Henry, a doctor for 
Brooklyn Medical Associates, will 
be speaking on Wednesday, Dec. 
11 at 10 a.m. The lecture will also 
take place in the Gales Sports 
Center, Room 104. His familiarity 
with migraine headaches comes 
from the many patients be sees 
who have them. 

According to Quake, migraine 



headaches are commonly confused 
with sinus headaches. 

"It's important to see a 
neurologist and not jusi a regular 
doctor" said Quake. "Often times 
people do not know the cause of 
ibeir frequent headaches and a lot 
of money is wasted on going from 
doctor to doctor." 

There are many triggers for 
migraines which vary from person 
to person. 

Many people can be affected by 
drinking a glass of red wine, for 
others it could be a candy bar. 
Migraines are inherited for the 
most part, but not limited to thaL 
Anyooe can get a migraine. 

Other factors to consider when 
trying to deal with these headaches 
is stress, paying attention to your 
diet, and for women, hormonal

Internet becomes 
tool for mindless 



IPFW students have access to 
the intemel — the so-called 
information superhighway. 
What do we get from this? 

Ideas for our research papers? 
Perhaps Discussion of controver- 
sial subjects? Possibly Chat lines 
for sex talk? Definitely. Downloads 
of nude pictures of Terry (Lois 
Lane) Hatcher and Dean (Clark 
Kent/Superman) Cain. Same 
answer as before 

The information superhighway 
has evolved ^^^^^^^^= 



tani about life. 

Or has entertainment become 
the most important thing in our col- 
lective lives? Society has become 
so violent and weird that we are 
forced lo escape the horrors of the 
real world by any means possible 

Escape from the real world from 
time 10 time is healthy (unless you 
are bitting "The Real World" web 
page designed to satisfy the quench 
of faithful MTV viewers), but we 
have become a 



into the "info- 
l a i n m e n I " 
superhighway. 
Originally, the 
Internet idea 
was a noble 
one: the quick 
and thorough 
dissemination 
and gathering 
of news and 
other informa- 
tion 

A small 
minorily of 
people use the 
"net" just for 
gathering infor- 
mation. But a 
large majority 
"surf the net" 
for purely 

entertainment

Stevie Nicks - 

the Fleetwood Mac singer who 
twirled onstage in chiffon dresses 
and sang of witches and gypsies.) 

What has been intended to revo- 
lutionize the communications and 
and news business has become a 
medium for rinding out what hap- 
pened on "X-Files" after being con- 
fused by the most recent episode 

Does this obsession with enter- 
tainment illustrate what wc have 
become as a society? Have we 
become so tormented about what is 
on television or in music that we 
have forgotten what is really impor-

Editor bids adieu to paper, people 




"I'm withdrawing my applica- 
tion as editor of The Communicator 
for the spring semester." 

That's how I broke the news lo 
the staff and board members, 
announcing my intentions of not 
being editor of this paper next 
semester. But instead of going qui- 
etly, I have a few things to say and 
a few people to thank. 

First, everyone needs to know 
that I am doing this for very person- 
al reasons, and that I've made ihis 
decision without any influence from 
anyone at this university. Some will 
think I am being punished for 
expressing too much of my opinion 
of certain issues, but that is not the 
case. 1 have received a lot of sup- 
port and encouragement from 
lPFW's administration and students

I am choos- 
ing not to be

Communicator is a great place to

major or English major to benefit 
from the experience and education 
The Communicator has lo offer. 
Whatever your goals are - improv- 
ing your writing, becoming a good 
journalist, learning managerial 
skills - you can achieve them at The 
Communicator, and I encourage 
you to do so. 

Finally, there is a long list of 
people whom I would like to pub- 
licly thank for helping me grow as a 
person and as a student. They are: 

1. My life partner and best

friend, who has waited patiently 
week after week as I worked my ass 
off at this paper It is he lo whom I 
dedicate my life and for whom I 
hope (his decision will have the 
most positive effect. 

2 Dorie Reynolds, publisher of 
The Communicator. She has taught 
me so much about so many things 
and let me teach her a thing or two 
as well. I hope my exit doesn't give 
her too many headaches in the near 
future. 

3 Nol Beckley. This is a guy 
who doesn't gel enough applause 
for his dedication to this paper He 
is an excellent father, a great jour- 
nalist and a helluva guy He's 
earned my admiration and he 
deserves yours. 

4. Marian Zimmerman, dean of 
students and president of The 
Communicator board of directors. 
She is one of the true friends of the 
student body. 

5. The staff of The 
Communicator. These individuals 
work so hard for so little praise It 
was great working with ihem. and 
for those who stay on. I offer you 
my best wishes. 

6. Chancellor Mike Wartell and 
his vice chancellors. They always

To the Editor 

I am a student at IPFW this 
fall. 1 am a freshman and have 
just siarted lo read The 
Communicator on a regular basis. 
I wanted to send you my opinion 
in regards to a certain article ("E- 
mail nol priority") that appeared 
in die Nov.7 issue. 

I'm sure you are familiar with 
the article aboul E-mail not being 
a priority, since you did write it. 

First off, I think it is wrong for 
any staff member to ask a student 
to leave the computer lab in any 
part ol the campus You have the 
right to correct me if I'm wrong. 
but aren't we, the sludenis, pay- 
ing IPFW to lei us use the com- 
puters as part of our technology 
fee? I don't know about anyone 
else, but I'm going to take advan- 
tage of it if I'm paying for it. 
Either that, or I could demand my 
30 some dollars back for which I 



am paying to use the campus 
computer labs. 

I need to add something else 
lo go along wilh my complaint. I 
bad a personal run in with one of 
tbe staff members in Kettler Hall 
three weeks ago I was sitting 
there "surfing the net" as was the 
man next to me As I was silting 
there, a staff member walked over 
to me and told me to come back ai 
a later time if I'm not working on 
any school-related material at this 
time. 

Having to leave wasn't really 
the problem. If I would have been 
asked nicely to leave, instead of 
being told, maybe I would have 
taken it better. Being asked and 
being told are two separate 
things I think it should be first 
come, first serve. 

I appreciate your lime. Thank 
you. 

Matthew C. Henry 



lo or not). I owe all of the members 
of this department a stiff drink for a 
number of reasons: 1) for treating 
me like an adult, and 2) for treating 
me like a friend If you aren't happy 
wilh your current major of sludy, 
check Mil - department oul. It will be 
worth the visil, I promise. 

8 My best friend. Leonard 
Helfrich, who has seen my personal 
growth and has always been honest 
with me. I'd suggest gelling to 
know him, bul we already spend loo 
link time together, so back off! 

9. Fred Douse, former editor of 
The Communicator. Although I find 
some of his recent opinions lo be 
hypocritical of his past writings, I 
will chalk them up to personal evo- 
lution. He was the one who intro- 
duced me to The Communicator So 
you can either thank or blame him 

10. The members of IPSGA 
Although there are still some issues 
between both offices, I understand 
how much time they put into their 
work It was nice being on the team 
of people who helped end the bick- 
ering between the two offices. I 
hope the respect continues after my 
departure. 

I could go on, but 1 don't want to 
bore you anymore than I have 
already. This bas been a fun ride 
and everyone should buy a ticket. 
And thanks lo my supporters and 
friends of the gay community I 
hope I have served you well in this 
endeavor. 

Peace, love and come out

School of Fine and Performing Arts plans New York City trip 




J 



by Cawk Hitter 
Features Editor 

Tbe School of Fine and Performing Aits is hosting a 
nip to New York, hut this is not any ordinary nip. It is a 
trip in which you will see the best of Broadway. The trip 
is scheduled lo take place during March 12-16. and it is 
open to the public. Larry L. Life, professor, chair, and 
artistic director of theater, and Craig A. Humphrey, 
assistant professor of theater, will chauffeur the event. 

The package trip includes round-trip airfare; round- 
trip hotel transfers; four nights at the Edison Hotel, in the 
heart of New York's theater district; orientations; 
sessions upon arrival; dinner at Tavern on the Green; and 
several optional guided activities, including backstage 
tours, dining, shopping. 

While on the trip, you are free to tour the sighls in 



New York on your own. However. Life and Humphrey 
are very familiar with ihe area and will help get you 
where you want to go. 

This is the third year for the excursion and according 
to Humphrey, tumoul has been great in the past years. 

"It's been a great lime. We've had a lot of really 
favorable responses from people who have gone," 
Humphrey said. 

This experience should prove to be quite a learning 
experience for those who are unfamiliar with theater and 
New York. "We get opportunities to sometimes go back- 
stage, sometimes to meet with the stars of the show." 
Life said. 

Life and Humphrey will have discussion sessions 
before and after each performance. A brief history of the 
play or musical will be given before each performance 
so that you have a better understanding of the play or 



musical. In addition, the group will be able to discuss 
their thoughts and understanding of each performance. 

"We focus the trip on trying to expose them to as 
much information about the working commercial theater 
in New York as best we can," Humphrey said. 

According to Life, this package is a great experience 
for the price. 

"It's a real bargain, and these are good seats, we 
aren't stuck up in ihe balcony." 

The package price is SI. 195 per person, double 
occupancy. Other occupancy rates are available. A 
second package price is also available and includes three 
— instead of five — Broadway musicals for $1,060. A 
S350 deposit is due by December 9. To reserve your spot 
for the trip call the School of Fme and Performing Arts 
at 481-6977.

Allergy Alert 



by l.i.ri Johnson, RjN. 
Staff Writer 

Does a runny nose, watery eyes, 
sneezing, coughing and itching paint 
the perfect picture of you or your child? 
If so, like numerous people, you arc 
probably suffering from allergies or hay 
fever. 
AtL£RQI£i AiVO 7WOE a4i/ses 

One might be wondering what 
exactly are allergies? In short, they are 
ibe body's attempt to protect itself from 
what (be immune system interprets as 
a harmful substance, referred to as an 
allergen or antigen. Usually, these 
allergens are either inhaled or ingested. 
Some common foods that could act 
as potential irritants include: fish, wheat, 
peas, shellfish, eggs, peanuts, milk, nuts 
and soy. 

Inhaled allergens are usually 
classified as indoor or outdoor. IV most 
important outdoor allergen is pollen 
from weeds, grasses, trees and mold. 
Indoor allergens include fecal matter 
of the house dusl mile which exists in 
every home regardless of cleanliness; 
the saliva of a cockroach: and allergens 
from pets, especially cats. Some 
examples of other potential allergens 
are tobacco smoke, cleaning materials, 
paints, furniture polish and pet hair. 
When any of these allergens are 
inhaled, or ingested, a cycle of events 
is triggered within the body. 



The foreign antigen is recognized 
by the immune system, a substance such 
as histamine is released, and the 
histamine causes an inflammatory 
process. The inflarrrmation presents itself 
first as nasal congestion, then as a runny 
nose, watery eyes, itching and sneezing. 
Svwrort 

Symptoms can lake a variety of 
forms, but the most common symptom 
is hay fever which, according to 
Statistics, effects twenty percent 
of the population. Hay fever 
presents itself as follows: a 
stuffy nose, sneezing and a 
runny nose, mouth breathing, 
discoloration and swelling 
under the eyes, as well as 
watery eyes. As one can 
tell, these symptoms are 
very similar to the 
symptoms one experiences 
with other respiratory infections, such 
as the common cold or the flu. 

So how can you tell the difference? 
The cold or flu. more often than not. 
presents itself with a fever whereas hay 
fever does not. Next, the nasal 
discharge is different. Allergy discharge 
is thin and clear and the cold or flu 
discharge is (hick and yellow. 
Funhcnnore, (he cold/flu duration would 
Ibe three to ten days, while the 
duration of an allergy would be all 
season. 

Research has found that there are 
two major ways to treat allergies: 



environmental control and 
pbarma cotherapy. Environmentally, 
(here are several measures one could 
lake. 

Keep track of pollen and mold 
counts to judge when an outdoor activity 
is tolerable. Pollen and dust counts are 
highest in the morning, so plan your 
day accordingly. Researchers suggest 
keeping windows closed during the 
pollen season. Research 
has also shown thai air 
conditioning can act as a 
filter to pollen and 
mold spores. 

Other suggestions 
include manipulation 
of the home 
environment. For 
instance, keeping the 
bedroom free from 
stuffed animals and 
carpeting; using vinyl coverings 
around mattresses, box springs, and 
feather pillows; and keeping pets out 
of the home. To avoid mold and dust 
mites, one must try to keep the house 
as clean and dry as possible. It may 
also be wise to deep a journal of the 
allergens, what reactions occur, how 
long they last, and what helps to alleviate 
them; and since some allergies are 
inherited, it would be helpful to keep 
a family medical history. 

Pharmacologically, (here are four 
major options available: anlilustamines, 
cromolyn, topical steroids and 
decongestants. Antihistamines are 




the drug of choice for symptoms such 
as watery, iichy eyes, runny nose; and 
sneezing, but they will not help with 
the congestion or swelling that may 
take place. In conjunction with 
antihistamines, a chronic sufferer 
should use cromolyn, which is an 
inhaled substance available through 
prescription. 

Cromolyn works best as a 
preventative measure and should be 
taken seven to ten days before 
allergy season starts. Cromolyn will 
suppress the histamine-induced 
symptoms and relieve swelling and 
nasal congestion, bu( only if used 
correctly. Another drug option is 
topical steroids which suppress Ibe 
inflammation in the initial as well as 
later phase of exposure. Topical 
steroids are generally safe, with the 
potential side effects being reduction 
in bone density and suppression of 
bone growth, so usage should be 
monitored in a growing child or a 
postmenopausal woman 
Decongestants can also be used and 
are available over-the -counter. They 
can cause nervousness and elevation 
in blood pressure, and they should 
only be used for four to five days lo 
avoid nasal irritation. 

Allergies can be controlled by 
recognizing them and seeking early 
treattneni. Prevention should be the 
first step and guidance of a physician 
should be sought immediately 
thereafter.

Herpes Alert 



by Dawn Phillips, U.V 
Staff Writer 

Suppose your doctor just lold you 
that you have herpes. Immediately your 
mind fills with questions. What is ii? 
How did I gel it? What will happen 
to me? These are all common questions 
about one of the most prevalent 
sexually transmitted diseases (STD's) 
in the U.S. today. 

The Center for Disease Control 
estimates that 7 to 20 million people 
are affected with geniial herpes; that's 
up to 1 in 10 persons. Yet, even with 
all the education and push for safe sex, 
the incidence of genital herpes 
continues to rise, especially in young 



adults. 

Oral and genital herpes are caused 
by the same family of viruses which 
causes cold sores, fever blisters, 
chickenpox, and shingles. Cold sores 
or lesions above the waist are normally 
caused by herpes simplex virus- 1; those 
below (he waist by HSV-2. However. 
due to aoss-coniaminaiion and oral 
sex, geniial herpes or oral herpes can 
be caused by either virus. The two 
infections are dimcafJy indistinguishable. 

Herpes is transmitted by genital, 
orogenital. or oroanal sex by the 
shedding of the virus from the 
contaminated person, normally through 
an active lesion. The virus enters the 
body through direct contact with 
mucous membranes such as the eyes, 
nose, mourn, genital tract, rectum, or 
a break in the skin. There is no evidence 



thai supports contamination from 
inanimate objects like toilet seats, bath 
water, moist towels, cups, or other 
similar objects. Once infected with the 
virus, a person will always be infected 
There is no cure for berpes. 

One can prevent transmission or try 
lo prevent a recurrence. Abstinence is 
the only method that is 100 percent 
successful in preventing transmission. 
Monogamy with a known herpes free 
person is the next best option. 
Decreasing the number of sexual 
partners, informmg a partner of one's 
condition, and proper use of condoms 
with nonoxynol-9, which renders the 
vims inactive, are all safe sexual 
practices that should be implemented 
to prevent not only herpes transmission, 
but also HrV and other serious STD's. 
Yei. it is important to remember that 



condoms will not protect a partner from 
lesions. 

If infected, or suspect that you are, 
measures should be taken to control 
its recurrence or complications 
immediately.

Campus hosts trip to Purdue 
Christmas show 



by Shannon Flnton 
Chief Reporter 

What would the Christmas 
season be like without a litilc song 
and dance? 

In the spirit of Christmas, the 
IPFW School of Fine and 
Performing Arts and the IPFW 
Alumni Association are offering a 
trip to the Purdue Musical 
Organization's (PMO) annual 
Christmas Show at Purdue 
University in West Lafayette on 
Saturday, Dec. 7. 

The PMO Christmas show is a 
popular tradition of the Purdue 
campus Every year, the production 
sells out six shows in one weekend 
in the 6.000-seat thealcr The show 
features a fully-staged presentation 
of holiday music by all of the PMO 
groups, and showcases the 
internationally-known Purdue 
Men's Glee Club. 

"The show is different every 
year," said Christina Kulow, 
director of public relations. "They 
have different costumes, sets and 
different songs." 

A Christmas dinner will also be 
available in the Sagamore Room of 
Ihe Purdue Memorial Union 



Building. The meal is in a buffet 
style, consisting of a traditional 
main course, a salad bar and a drink. 
The cost is SI3.50 per person and 
the reservations should be included 
at the time of registration for the 
I trip. 

The motorcoach will be leaving 
at 12 pm from the IPFW Williams 
Theatre parking lot and reium to the 
campus in ibe evening, around 11 
p.m. 

"The appropriate attire for the 
evening can be considered 'dressy- 
casual.' maybe dress pants or 
something like that." said Kulow 

This is the first year that IPFW 
has offered this trip Kulow says 
ihat if there is a decent turnout, 
there is a possibility the trip will be 
offered again 

An evaluation of the road trip 
will be made to determine whether 
or not it will be beneficial to offer it 
on a yearly basis. 

The cost of the trip is S42 per 
person. The trip includes round trip 
luxury motorcoach transportation 
from the IPFW Williams Theatre to 
Purdue's Elliot Hall of Music, a

Student senate agrees 
on educational campaign 



by Jeremy Ecenbargcr 
News Editor 

Forced child labor, drug 
exporting, the spread of AIDS, .all 
these events arc taking place in 
Burma The Southeast Asian 
country is ruled by the Slate Law 
and Order Restoration Council 
(SLORC), which many feel is 
ruining the couniry. PepsiCo 
remains to be one, of only a few, 
corporations left there, sponsoring 
many of SLORC's events. So, how 
should IPFW become involved? 

Last Wednesday, the 
Indiana/Purdue Student 
Government Association (IPSGA) 
discussed what the campus' 
involvement should be in regard to 
the PepsiCo boycott taking place 
throughout the country During the 
studeni senate meeting, a decision, 
based on the legislation authored by 
Eric Ledbeiter, a student senate 
member, was made to develop an 
educational campaign to inform 
students about the human rights 
issues involved in Burma. 



"We are not pushing a full 
boycott," said Gina Burgess, studeni 
senate pro tern. "Students might 
panic at the sudden idea of 
boycotting Pepsi products." 

The educational campaign will 
consist of a variety of tactics 
including Ihe creation and 
distribution of fliers describing 
conditions in Burma and the role of 
international corporations, such as 
PepsiCo, should play in ihem. 

Other parts of the campaign 
include a referendum, a petition 
drive and a letter- writing campaign 
directed at international 
corporations, US political leaders 
and SLORC itself. 

The Legislative Affairs 
Committee will also organize an 
open forum and showing of the film 
"Burma: Land of Fear," that will 
display ibe conditions of the 
country. 

"We want to familiarize the 
campus with the terms SLORC and 
Burma," said Burgess. "We'll 
slowly build up from there," 



Because 
all-nighters 

aren't always 

spent in 

the library.

New faces, new coach, no problems 

Mastodons gather victories against long-standing rivals and scrappy outsider 



by S. Brant Kelley 
Sports Editor 

IPFW's men's basketball team 
started the season off hot, winning 
its first three games, nail-biters all 

Beginning the season with its 
Summit City Shootout. IPFW 
hosted three other local schools, Tri- 
Slate University. Indiana Tech and 
St. Francis College, in an inaugural, 
annual tournament. 

The Mastodons faced off against 
Tri-State University in the 
tournament's first-round game and 
avenged a last year's two-point loss, 
79-74. 

"It was a typical first game.'' 
IPFW coach John Williams said. 
"We didn'i know what to expeel 
from us and we didn'i know what to 
expect from them " 

Williams did expect good 
outside shooting from the Thunder, 
but Tri-Slate shot only 29 pcrceni 
from the three-point arc. Center 
Chad Boll did most of the damage 
on the interior with cigbt-of-12 
shooting and a learn-high seven 
rebounds. 

Boll finished with 21 points lo 
lead all scorers and three other Tn- 
Siaie players scored in double 
figures. Guard Cracdel Key and 
forward Charles Porier were 
IPFW's only double-figure scorers, 
but nine Mastodons found their way 
to the scoring column in a balanced 
effort. 

Saturday night, IPFW played 
Indiana Tech for Ihe first lime in 
four years. Always a hard-foughi 
game. Ihe Mastodons won. 99-88, 
behind a combined 50 points by 
forward Kevin Beaily and guard 
Derek Miller 

"Both of them just played 
phenomenal," Williams said 
"Chuck Porter stepped up and did a 
nice job." 

Beatty collected a game-high 11 
rebounds lo go with bis scoring. 

They're (Tech) lough lo match 



up against because they slart a small 
lineup and they shoot ihe ball well,'' 
Williams said. 

Toumameni MVP Porter added 
17 points to help offsei a 25-point 
effort by Wamor Lamar Morton 

The 'Dons also dominated the 
glass, outrebounding ihe Warriors, 
44-27. 

"Coach Kline does a good job 
with his kids." Williams said "It 
was a good challenge because it was 
jusi a must-win." 

IPFW shol 53 percent from the 
field, including 50 percent from 



three-point range for the game and 
met 83 percent of its gift needs at 
ihe chanly stripe. 

The Masiodons squeaked Oy 
Hillsdale College. 76-75. ai the 
Gales Center despite some stiff 
numbers odds IPFW overcame the 
Chargers' 52 percent field-goal 
shooting.' 18 free throws and the 
seven-of-10 shooting of guard Scotl 
Elwer with perfect I0-for-10 free 
throw shooting themselves, a nine- 
board rebounding advantage and by 
pulling 11 players into the balanced 
scoring column

Lady 'Dons open uncertain season 

Coach laments rebounding, defense after two losses 



by S. Brant Kclky 
Sports Editor 

Scoring wins games, but 
defense and rebounding win 
championships. Such logic 
is being emphasized by IPFW 
coach Pam Bowdcn this season, 
especially aficr two season-opening 
losses which prompted major 



changes in operation 

The Lady Mastodons got their 
first 1. 1 -ii of season competition last 
week and a better idea of what 
winning will take at the Division II 
level. 

The Lady 'Dons travelled first 
to Rochester, Mich, and lost 10 
Oakland University. 75-59, in a 
game IPFW coach Pam Bowden 




Freshman guard Nicole Ruggles passes around a Hillsdale defender 
during lPFW's 86-60 loss last Saturday 



said could have been much worse. 

"Oakland is a very good team ... 
Probably one of the best teams in 
the region," Bowden said. "They 
actually have two different styles of 
game, they can go with the three- 
point game or they can go with the 
game inside. 

"After scouting them, I figured 
we could have been in real deep 
trouble as far turnovers ... We could 
totally blow up and it would be a 
40-point game." 

The Pioneers were playing their 
fourth contest; it was fPFW's first. 

"Considering where we're at ... 
I think it was a decent game. I was 
very disappointed in the 
rebounding I thought the 
rebounding was pathetic," said 
Bowden. 

IPFW returned to the Gates 
Center to host the Summit City 
Sftoutout, which included Hillsdale 
College, the University of 
Charleston and California 
University of Pennsylvania. 
Starting next year, the shooiout will 
feature Tri-State University, St. 
Francis College and Indiana Tech. 
on an annual basis. 

Hillsdale College came into 
town for the first time in four years 
and pounded the Lady 'Dons, 86- 
60 

"I thought we just didn't play 
hard." Bowden said. "We didn't 
play with very much heart, we 
didn't play with very much 
intensity." 

The Chargers extended their 
season-opening winning streak to 
four games and dropped IPFW to 0- 
2, despite 38 points from Leah

"We thought it would be a 
different game." Hillsdale coach 
Rose Antrim said "We were 
prepared ... I was surprised it was 
one-sided." 

Though the Lady 'Dons 
rebounded with Hillsdale (30 each), 
the Chargers held IPFW to just 47 
field goal attempts. The Lady "Dons 
hit 22 of them for nearly 47 percent, 
but Hillsdale got 62 looks at the 
basket, and made good on 33 of 
ibem. Eight of those hits were from 
long range, where the Chargers hit 
.533 for the game. 

IPFW also gave the ball away 
23 times 

"I think our defense was very 
strong, 

•They're (IPFW) an exceptional 
team." Antrim said "I think they're 
just young right now." 

The University of Charleston 
supped past California. 67-64, to 
advance to the championship game 
against Hillsdale 



The previous two losses heavy 
on her mind. Bowden shuffled the 
siarung lineup to get more eager 
youth playing time. 

"If we're going to lose," 
Bowden said. "We're going to lose 
with young kids because at least 
they're going to get some 
experience." 

They didn't lose. In the 
tournament's consolation game, 
IPFW overcame a bad shooting 
night to beat the Vulcans handily, 
76-54, in a game marked by 52 total 
turnovers. 

Shalauna McMillan collected a 
game-nigh 1 3 rebounds as the Lady 
'Dons outboarded California 51-44, 
and Henry and Sheets poured in 41 
points to lead the way in a more 
balanced offense. 

Henry's 43 points over two 
games earned her all-tournament 
honors. 

Part of Sheets' 18 points came 
on 10-of-12 free throw shooting 
and Henry hit 7-for-9 from the 



charily stripe. After starting the first 
two games, junior guard Tara 
Beauchine came otT the bench to 
score 15 points, hitting 5-of-8 from 
the field. 

IPFW combined to hit 22 of its 
66 shot attempts, but the Vulcans 
hit only 21 of 62 and committed 30 
turnovers. 

"I think the young kids did a 
good job." Bowden said. "They 
played hard. Yeah, they made 
mistakes, but they played hard. 

"(Last year) We lost a chunk of 
offense." Bowden said. 'Today we 
scored more." 

"My expectations are that 
Jessica and Leah fill that role. I 
think those two have done what 
we've needed for the most part" 

The Lady Dons play in the 
North Dakota Slate Tournament 
tomorrow and Saturday, providing 
more lough competition in the form 
of the country's top-ranked team.
