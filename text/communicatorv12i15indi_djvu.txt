Volume XII ls.sue 15 



Indiana University-Purdue University at Ft. Wayne 



January 15, 1981 



In Brief . . . 

Aid deadline soon 

Bv GLORIA HIZER 
STAFF WRITER 

Students requesting financial aid for the 1981-82 academic year must have 
their applications filed with the Financial Aid Office no later than Feb. IS, 1981, 
according to Mark Franke, assistant director of financial aids. "It is strictly on 
a first come, first serve basis," said Franke, indicating the Importance of ap- 
plying early (o receive the funds while they are still obtainable. He predicts that 
an excess of $4 million of financial aid will be available to some 4,000 applicants 
for (he coming year. "We are going to have a lot more applicants and if they 
don't meet the deadline, we're not going to have any money for them next 
year," said Franke. 

The Basic Granl Program and the Guaranteed Student Loan Program IGSL) 
are the only except ions since these funds are available through individual banks 
and they set their own deadlines. Eligible students can apply at any time for 
these loans. But in terms of general financial aid, al] other programs will be 
subject to the cutoff date of Feb. 15, 1981. Applications received after this date 
will be processed month by month until funds are deleted. 

Franke ahso pointed out that the educational amendments of 1980 passed by 
Congress increased the interest rates in the National Direct Student Loan 
Program (NDSLI from 3 percent to 4 percent for all borrowers, effective fall 
semester, 1961. A shortened grace period will be in effect requiring students to 
begin repayment of loans six months after leaving instead of the previous nine 
month grace period. First time borrowers in the GSL program will also be 
subject to a higher interest rate from 7 percent to 9 percent, effective spring 
semester. 1981, with the grace period reduced from nine months to six months. 

Work Study Program applicants must apply by the cutoff date of March 1, 
1981 or there is a good chance they won't gel a job 

Students can pick up the forms in the Financial Aid Office, Ketller 109 from 8 
a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday— Thursday, and from 8 a.m. to S p.m. on Friday, or after 
hours at the counter. 

Senate reveals plans 

By JIM CHAPMAN 
Chief Reporter 

During the final three meetings of the fall semester, the Student Senate 
produced a resolution of praise and passed one of three bills to allocate money to 
subscribe to three important publications that affect IPFW. 

Since decisions made at the Bloomington and West Lafayette campuses affect 
IPFW, two separate bills to allocate money for a one year subscription to the 
Purdue Exponet and the Indiana Daily Student were brought to the floor for a 
vote. The IDS was turned down and the Purdue Exponet was withdrawn from 
vote. The Senate passed a bill to allocate money to subscribe to Chronicle on 
Higher Education, a publication dealing with trends in education. " 

The Student Senate gave the athJetic department a pat on the back by 
resolving to congratulate the IPFW men's basketball team for winning the 
fourth annual Tip-Off Tourney sponsored by the Downtown Sertoma Club. 

Upcoming projects for the spring semester include the spring budget. The 
Senate will vote on how much money to distribute to the various areas of IPFW 
according to their needs. 

Student Body President Ann Momper will appoint an election board of five 
members and two alternates to conduct an election in which the student body 
will elect new senators to save for the next term. 

The Senate plans to do what they can to help restore the shortage of money 
needed to furnish the inside of the Health, Physical Education and Recreation 
Building. "We're going to be doing some strong lobbying," said Vice President 
Steve We si rick. 

Other projects include the taking of ID pictures, set for Jan. 26-27 from A p.m. 
to 7 p.m. and Jan. 28-29 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. The Senate also plans to continue 
the car-pooling project- 

Young men register 

By BOB WILLIAMS 
Staff Writer 

The registration of males into ihe Selective Service System took place last 
week. Males born in 1962 were to have registered by Saturday, January 11th, 
while those born in 1963 are to register within 30 days of their lflth birthday. 
Registration can be done at any branch of the U.S. Post Office. 

The registration, which was discontinued in 1975, has been renewed to speed 
up the induction of men into the military in case of an emergency. 

Much opposition has been raised against the registration. Demonstrations 
against it were made throughout the country. President-elect Ronald Reagan 
has stated his opposition to any peacetime registration. The Supreme Court has 
a case before it, derived from a U.S. District Court Judge's ruling, questioning 
the constitutionality of the registration because women were not called on to 
regisler. 



Enrollment steady 



Bv RICHARD FLECKER 
Stan Writer 

Spring registration has come lo an 
end, with the signs of a well-fought 
hattle still lingering throughout (he 
war-torn walls of the administration 
offices. 

Although the official enrollment 
figures for the spring semester will not 
be released until after the second week 
of classes, past trends show that spring 
-enrollment is usually 10 percent lower 
than the fall semester. Even though the 



fall semester, 1980, with an enrollment 
of 10,182 students, is higher than the 
9.191 students enrolled in the fall, 1979, 
a 10 percent decrease is most likely. 
However, enrollment h.3S been en- 
couragingly steady. 

Jack C. Dahl, registrar at IPFW 
stated that while many of the people 
who have been laid-off are enrolling 
here, (he ones who have been out of 
work for a period of time are not likely 
to be able to afford the cost of a college 
education.

Group provides support 



By ROBERT 
RINEARSON 

Copyright 1 981 
Chief Reporter 

The meri sit around the table at a 
local Jimmy's Pizza. There is very 
little laughter amongst the group. 
Instead, most show grim expressions 
and the conversation remains serious. 
These men all have one (hing in com- 
mon; all have fought through the 
judicial system for custody of their 
children. Some of the men have won, 
most have not. 

The group is Fathers United, and 
since 1974 it has served (hasurrounding 
area as a liason for divorced fathers. 

Co-founder Robert Elmer described 
why he felt there was a need for such a 
group. "When 1 went through my own 
divorce, all the judicial feet-padding 
and stalling bothered me. It took 28 
months and it made me sick to see what 
it was doing to the kids. Luckily I won 
custody, but I saw there was a very 
clear discrimination against men when 
it comes to divorce," Elmer, a social 
worker with the Veterans Hospital in 
Fort Wayne is a soft spoken man who 
proudly displays pictures of his 
children around his office. 

"In Fathers United, we constantly 
encourage the man to keep on, not give 
up, and not let himself fall into a state of 
selfdestructiveness," Elmer said. 

In past divorce cases, courts based 
their decisions on the doctrine, 
"presumption in favor of Ihe mother," 
As a rule for custody. But the new 
Indiana law clearly stales that the 
awarding of custody shall be in the 
"best interests" of the child with no 
"presumption in favor of either 
parent." 

But courts throughout Indiana 
continue to overwhelmingly favor the 
mother, completely disregarding the 
father. 



Workers for the Allen County Family 
Court Services proudly poinl out the 
I rend is reversing here. 
. Ten years «go perhaps 5 percent of 
the fathers received custody of their 
children. Now it's up to 40 percent," 
says Ann Hitchins, a Custody 
Investigator for Allen Superior Court. 
"1 believe Allen County is the only 
county in Indiana that does custody 
investigation. And you have to have 
investigations if the court is to have 
true insight lo what the best interests of 
the child actually are," 

Most of ihe members of Fathers 
United recognize the improved chances 
of winning custody in Allen County or at 
least those who have already won 
custody. But members are also quick to 
point ou! who gets custody and who 
doesn't isn't the only flaw in the system. 

"The lawyers will bleed you dry." 
said Josh Tourkow, himself an - at- 
torney. "The support payment 
schedules has the man giving up half of 
his income to the woman if she wins 
custody. Plus he pays taxes on support. 
And the courts don't take into con- 
sideration what the father would like to 
spend on his own children when he gets 
visitation." 

Tourkow continued, "Pius a year 
afler the final decision and every year 
afterwards, the wife is free to return to 
the court and request an increase in 
support. If she wins, which is usually 
the case, the man not only pays the 
increase, but also her attorney fees, 
which can be exorbitant." 

Dale Baird is a young father who lost 
custody of his two children to his wife. 
More than frustrated, he exemplified 



his own case. "When I got divorced I the Master-Charge, Visa, the car 
got slapped with giving 40 percent of payments, andall herdoctorbills."

'S no fun for crew

"Not being able to be in ten places al 
once," Dick Dirram said Is his 
problem. Dirram, IPFW's grounds 
supervisor, is the man in charge of 
snow removal. 

The first area cleared after a snow is 
the main entrance (o the campus, 
Dirram said. Next, the immediate 
parking areas are cleared — the north 
A-lol, east A-B lots, and the Kettler 
south A-tot.Tlien, (lie parking areas for 
Ihe handicapped students are made 
accessible, followed by the sidewalks 
and more distant parking lots. 

Snow disposal is an imporlant part of 
snow removal. The groundsmen push 
(he snow into banks at (he side of the 
walks and in between parking lots. 
Often this poses a driving hazard and 
the show is removed off campus as 
quickly as possible and deposited at 
designaled snow dumping sites. 

Dirram is an easy going, often 
smiling man whose lined, tan face and 
hard blue eyes look as though he has 
spent many years outdoors. He - 
presently has three men under his 
command, but would like to have a full 
staff of five before the next heavy snow. 

Removal equipment ranges from a 



small sidewalk tractor, to a new Case 
payloader, to a pair of one-ton trucks 
and a 1975 five-ton (ruck with a spinner- 
sander. Much of the equipment was 
purchased from (he Indiana State High- 
way Commission and reconditioned in 
the shop facilities on campus at the 
Physical Plant. 

"It's been remarked that we have 
more equipment with which lo handle 
this campus than some of these small 
towns have to handle all of their 
streets," Dirram said. But with all the 
sludenls at IPFW, Dirram also has 
more people and cars to deal with than 
many small towns. 

Also in supply are two or three tons of 
ice melter for concrete sidewalks, and 
60-100 Ions of salt and sand mixture for 
asphalt parking lots. Dirram would like 
to keep a couple of tons of dry sand on 
hand to lake the sllckness off the ice, 
but has no where to store it. 

It is Important thai the grounds staff 
gels snow up as quickly as possible, 
otherwise the snow becomes ice and is 
nearly impossible lo remove. In Ihe 
past there have been four or five bad 
falls on ice and at least one fracture. 

The groundsmen are always willing 
to help people by clearing a space for 



them or jump-starting a car. After all, 
Dirran said, "the faster we can get 
people off campus, the faster we can 
clear the lots." Often the grounds staff 
must work 12 hours a day and even as 
they did before classes started this 
semester, around the clock. 

The ramp between Ihe Helmke 
Library and Neff Hall, where ice 
creates a hazard, poses a problem for 
Dirram because of the difficulty in 
removing hardpocked snow on a slope. 
Abandoned cars pose another problem 
for Dirram, 

Cars are occassionally left on campus 
either because they wouldn't start, or 
the driver thought the weather too 
rough and found another way home. 
These cars must be plowed around and 
become even harder to move af- 
terward. 

While Dirram said he is "thrilled to 
death" with his equipment, he would 
like to see bis staff increased in the 
future. He said that many people feel 
(hat, because of the new buildings going 
up at IPFW, resulting in less grass lo 
mow, maintenance costs will go down. 
Dirram points out, however, that less 
grass means more sidewalks to shovel 
and more shrubbery to trim

Reagan previewed 
as contradictory 

NextTuesrlav .Ian 2fl Ronald Reaean .1 .1 *L. . 



Next Tuesday, Jan. 20, Ronald Reagan 
will be sworn in as the 40th president of 
the United States. 

The people of the United States, as 
well as the entire world, watch with 
interest to see how he will execute his 
presidential duties. 

Reagan, somewhat surprised by the 
size of his November victory, views his 
triumph as the start of a "crusade" to 
rebuild a stronger, more conservative 
America. 

The most obvious goals of the new 
Chief Executive include: a very strong 
push for tax cuts totaling 30 percent over 
the next three years; a balanced federal 
budget by 1983; repeal of many govern- 
mental regulations on business; and a 
re-establishment of the U.S.'s military 
superiority by drastically stepping up 
defense spending (experts say this 
buildup could add $100 billion to the 
currently projected defense budget of $1 
trillion dollars over the next five years). 

Yes, Reagan plans to make across-the- 
board cuts in personal income tax rates 
of 10 percent in 1981, another 10 per- 
cent in 1982, and still another 10 percent 
in 1983, while simultaneously increasing 
defense spending by millions, and 
simultaneously balancing the budget. 

Are these blatent contradictions? 

Obviously, yes, but there is still more. 

Whereas Jimmy Carter spent this past 
year trying to limit spending by 
tightening credit and putting restrictions 
on banks and lending institutions, 
Reagan has implied that, in time, he 
might pressure the Federal Reserve to 
loosen the money supply, thus allowing 
businesses to increase investments. 

With business spending large sums of 
money, and consumers spending more 
disposable income because they are 
paying fewer taxes, this will no doubt 
inflate the economy tremendously. If left 
unchecked, this could result in an in- 
flation rate higher than we ever 
dreamed possible. No longer would we 
have one of the lowest inflation rates of 
any country in the world. 

Other immediate goals of President- 
elect Reagan include a cut in the growth 
of federal spending by a total of 7 per- 
cent over the next four years, various 
incentives for business, an end to all 
federal price controls on oil and natural 
gas, and SALT III negotiations. 

If Reagan wishes to curtail federal 
spending by such large proportions, 
many essential government programs 
will have to be eliminated, although 
Reagan insists the savings can be 
achieved solely through the elimination 
of overspending, waste and fraud within 
the government, 

Reagan has said that, also, he will 
eventually ask Congress to eliminate the 
Department of Energy and the 
Department of Education, while stifling 
OSHA. the EPA, CETA, and the FTC 
agencies. 

Consequently, Reagan has incited 
strong antagonism from many special 
interest groups. 

One of the incentives proposed for 
businesses is a reduction in corporate 
taxes by allowing companies to deduct 
more of their plant and equipment costs 
at a faster rate. 

Reagan believes the removal of 
federal price controls on oil and natural 
gas will encourage more development of 
these resources in the U.S'. He has said 
■that the oil potential in Alaska is greater 



than the proven reserves of all of Saudi 
Arabia. In reality, however, one-third of 
the entire world's proven oil reserves 
are within Saudi Arabia's borders. A 
single one of these oil fields, the Ghawar, 
a 150-mile-long stretch, contains more 
than the proven reserves of Alaska and 
the entire continental United States 
combined. 

The present Strategic Arms 
Limitation Treaty, SALT II, according 
to Reagan, has allowed the Soviet Union 
to overtake the United States in military 
power by not sufficiently limiting Soviet 
arms. 

In SALT III, Reagan will propose 
tighter restrictions on the Soviet use of 
heavy missiles and Backfire bombers. 
The new treaty will provide procedures, 
Reagan claims, that will guarantee that 
neither side will breach the pact. 

The United States may truly be second 
militarily to the Soviet Union, but the 
degree to which we are second is 
questionable. We must recognize the 
Pentagon's never-ending desire for 
funds, and therefore, the never-ending 
effort to convince the people of Ihe 
United States that Russia is ahead of us 
militarily. 

Smaller issues also exist that will have 
to be dealt with by Reagan. 

Despite the growing evidence that the 
grain embargo on Russia is squeezing its 
economy, Reagan has, none the less, 
proposed an end to the embargo. This 
would please U.S. farmers, but new 
grain sales to Russia could possibly 
exhaust our already low grain stock- 
piles. 

A poor harvest when stockpiles are 
low would feed the inflation rate even 
more with runaway food prices, driven 
high by our competition with other 
nations for scarce supplies. 

Reagan might also abolish draft 
registration, a very noble concept in- 
deed. Could this, however, be in- 
terpreted by other countries as a 
weakening of America's stability? 

Another problem facing the Reagan 
administration is the danger that the 
Social Security system may soon run out 
of cash for retirement benefits 
Reagan's advisors have said that they 
feel there are a few options for com- 
bating this, including a gradual increase 
over the next few decasdes of the full- 
benefit retirement age, from 65 to 68 
years. 

Finally, although federal outlays for 
crime prevention will continue to 
decrease as they have in the past, 
because of budget slashes, Reagan has 
promised to support a federal program 
to compensate the victims of crimes. 
This is a fine gesture, but it is a remedy 
and not a preventative measure. What 
amount of money could adequately 
compensate the family of a man or 
woman who has been murdered? 

The President-elect will arrive in 
Washington to find a fairly cooperative 
congress and an extremely competent 
Cabinet with which to work. But the 
problems and solutions he will find 
within the confines of the Oval Office are 
yet to be known. 

The accomplishment of Reagan's 
goals for this nation depend very much 
upon the uncertain world, a tem- 
peramental economy and the large 
federal government in which he must 
operate. 



Study can 
be useful 

By Mill- WOLLMAN 
STAFF WRITER 

At lending college fulliime 
means constantly battling 
with tests, lectures, research 
papers, reports and endless 
amounts of reading. 

School can be grueling at 
times, but that "never say 
die" attitude and the will to 
succeed often keeps students 
forgoing toward their goals. 
Being a successful student is 
a tremendous challenge. 

Proper study habits for 
schoolwork are vital. 
Knowing where and bow lo 
study can make a world of 
difference. 

Begin with an environment 
that is conducive to 
relaxation and con- 
cenlralion, where there will 
be a few interruptions as 
possible. Have all necessary 
materials nearby so that 
once you begin to study it 
will not be necessary lo go 
searching for things. 

Get comfortably seated 
and then take a few minutes 
to draw up a shorl schedule 
of what work needs lo be 
done, the order in which it 
will be done, and how much 
time you have to do it. 

Then, take a moment lo 



yo 



df 



psychologically for worth- 
while, productive study 
session. 

It is imperative to follow 
the schedule. As you become 
more conditioned to working 
through each study session 
as planned, it will become a 
habit, and it will ensure you 
of always completing your 
work. « 

"Managing your time 
properly is the key to success 
in school,; said Kenneth 
Bundza, professor of 
psychology at IPFW. He also 
said thai many exceptionally 
bright students never 
complete college because 
they simply can't gel 
organized. 

But organize you must. 

Decide on your priorities. 
Schoolwork should come' 
first, bul if managed 
properly, you should be able 
to include other activities in 
your life without constantly 
feeling pressured for lime. 

Now concentrate on time 
management of your studies. 
Doing a minimal amount of 
work on each subject every 
day al planned study 
sessions is an excellent 
method. 

Anolher helpful hint — 
begin long term projects 
early. If there is a research 
paper or report due, begin 
working on it a few minutes 
daily in your study sessions a 
month or so before it is due. 
At this pace you will find the 
project much easier to ac- 
complish. 

There are various study 
methods, but as long as you 
use a realistic one and follow 
your priorities, you will be 
starling off on the right 
track. 

If students always have to 
force themselves to study, 
they will find college tifo 
increasingly uncomfortable, 
Remember a little planning 
and self-discipline go a long

He's not handicapped 



ByKlMKUZEFF 
Managing Editor 

Grant Neuhaus may be 
"slightly inconvenienced," 
but he's definitely not 
crippled or handicapped. 

Neuhaus, who broke his 
neck in a swimming accident 
more than five years ago, 
walks with the aid of metal 
crutches. 

A biology major and , 
chemistry minor at IPFW, 
Neuhaus, 20, finds his 
chemistry labs difficult 
because of the amount of 
moving around involved. "In 
this sense, I'm handicapped, 
though I don't like the word 
handicapped. You're only 
handicapped if you think 
you're handicapped, and I 
feel like I'm like everyone 
else. Anyone who thinks of 
me as handicapped doesn't 
know me " 

On August 13, 1975, a 
Friday, Neuhaus was at his 
last day of camp for the 
Youth Conservation Corps. 
While swimming, he did a 
surface dive, and snapped 
his neck as he hit the bottom 
of the lake. 



Unable to move, Neuhaus 
lay in the water, trying to 
move his head so he could 
breathe. Just as he was 
about lo lake a deep breath 
and a mouth full of water, a 
friend, who (bought Neuhaus 
was playing a game at first, 
turned him over and pulled 
him lo shore. 

Though Neuhaus was in 
intensive care for three 
days, the doctors wouldn't 
tell him what was going on. 
Tests revealed (hat he had a 
"V" fracture, and that his 
fifth cervical had popped 
completely out and gone 
back in, so no surgery was 
required. When the cervical 
popped out, it caused a bad 
contusion on the spinal cord, 
thus the paralysis. 

His parents were told that 
he was paralyzed from the 
neck down, and that it would 
be a miracle if he ever 
walked again. 

Neuhaus wouldn't accept 
this diagnosis, and he told 
the doctors that he would be 
up and around within two 
weeks. 



Though Neuhaus was in 
physical therapy to keep his 
muscles stretched out, 
nothing really happened 
until one night when he was 
watching TV with his mom in 
the hospital. He asked his 
mother to move his leg for 
him because it felt un- 
comfortable because it was 
pushed against the end of the 
bed. His mother told him to 
"move your own damn foot." 
Neuhaus said "OK" and 
tried very hard to move it, 
and he was successful. 
Physical therapy was 
stepped up. 

After four months. 
Neuhaus went home from 
the hospital, and he spent the 
next two years in a 
wheelchair. Since then he 
has been on the crutches. 
Though he has fallen a lot 
with the crulches, and he 
finds that they elicit a lot of 
stares, he is thankful for 
them. "I gained my freedom 
again because I could go 
anywhere and do anything. 1 
don't even think about the 
crutches any more," 



Though Neuhaus has been 
described as a "10" by 
friends, he tends to shun any 
kind of social life, and he is a 
self-proclaimed loner. 
Instead, he devotes most of 
his time to stydying for his 
eventual career as a biology 
(eacher. 

"During school times, I 
don't do anything but school. 
On weekends, I don't go 
anywhere except during the 
deer season, or when there is 
ice for ice fishing. I don'l like 
the social life at all ; I like the 
quiet home atomsphere," 
said Neuhaus. 

Neuhaus also enjoys 
watching educational 
programs or "Soap" on TV, 
if it doesn't interrupt his 
studying schedule, and he 
swims during the summer.

Fathers 

(Continued from page II 
Bob Frazer, an 

Agriculture salesman, said 
his divorce and the custody 
cost him (10,000 in attorney 
fees along. "The rest of 
dollars and cents spent is 
Just untold." 

Attorney Tourkow said 
thai to seek custody through 
appeal would cost the man 
between $3,000 and H.000. 

Bui the money snydrome 
isn't the only grievance that 
fathers and professionals 
hold against the lawyers. 

Says one father, "My ex- 
wife hired a lawyer thai just 
plain didn't give a damn 
about what the best interests 
of the children were. In fact, 
I don't think he ever met 

"A lot of attorneys base 
(heir whole case on our in- 
vestigation," stressed Ann 
Hitehins "Then they pickup 
their $3,000 and go their own 



"It's 



not 



lal," 



Tourkow said. "I think it's 
important to meet the 
children, talk with them, and 
generally learn their con- 
cerns. That way you get to 
see the interactions between 
parent and child. Plus you 
want to see the best interests 
my client is going to 
provide." 

Dennis Reith, Treasurer 
for Fathers United felt too 
many lawyers only add to 
the legal entanglement. 



"Hell, it's gotlen to the point 
in some stales where the 
court requires a lawyer for 
each parent, but requires an 
attorney for the child as 
well. I tell you they're 90 
percent of the problem. 

"It took me five attorneys 
before I found one I could 
trust." explained Elmer. 
"They seem to look upon 
custody hearings in much 
the same light as plea 
bargaining. You always 
have to give up something to 
get anything. One attorney 
even went so far as to 
suggest I trade my house' for 
(he kids. They can make il so 
complicated, so heart- 
breaking." 

But besides the attorneys, 
the men of Fathers United 
seem miffed and bitter about 
the inequality in a system 
whose facade suggest 
fairness. 

"I would say that 99 
percent of the women never 
have to pay support." 
suggests Tourkow. "And no 
matter what the law says, 
you'll have those judges that 
feel the child belongs at 
home with the mother." 

For a father going through 
divorce and seeing the 
hardship taking place on his 
children, he'll spend hours 
wondering why. Bui then 
he'll either search for a 
reason or a scapegoat. In 
almost every conversation 
the women's movement was 
mentioned either directly or 
indirectly. 



Bob Frazer tried to put his 
feelings in perspective at the 
time of his divorce. "I defin- 
itely felt a bitterness 
towards the women's 
movement, perhaps not so 
much now, but please try 
and understand. My wife 
was saying 'I have to be free 
to be me'. So she became 
free and forgot the children. 
I remember one night she 
never came home from 
work, in fact she never came 
home until the next morning. 
When the kids asked why, 
she told them she was now a 
free person and il was none 
of their business. It was 
tough getting (he kids to 
understand." 

Frazer felt his children 
would always feel the 
repercussions of the divorce. 
Elmer felt women are 
caught up in the role they 
should never give up their 
children because society 
would label them as bad 
mothers. "It's too bad, if 
society would accept the 
father's role in raising the 
child, the women who so 
wished could be free to 






thei 



reflected Elmer. 

Ann Hitehins seemed to 
agree in part with Elmer's 
statement of father's filling 
a duel role. "Most of the 
fathers I've known who've 
fought for custody have a 
great care and are very 
capable of providing a 
nuturing role for the child." 

For the love of their 



children, they continue to 
come lo the Fathers United 
meetings twice a month. 
They seek advice and 
fellowship, "It's a great way 
for some of these men just to 
let out their frustration," 
said Bob Elmer. "We've all 
known the same emotions." 
Another member who 
asked to remain anonymous 
aired his concern to me. "I 
only wish both the courts and 
the women could realize'that 
we are equal in emotions. Do 
they think we cannot love 
our children just as much. It 
was devastating when my 
wife, was granted custody of 
our two children. Later she 
moved (o California with 
ihem. Do you know how hard 
it can be to go through this 
life without having your 
children near you?" 

"I don't like being bitter," 
said Gene, a new member to 
Fathers United. "But it's 
what I've learned in the past 
five years that's made me 
so When you feed a child, 
tend -to his toilet habits, and 
share in his raising then 
suddenly he's gone, it 
becomes a lonely world." 

When I asked Gene about 
squabbling with his ex-wife 
over his weekend visitation, 
his jaw tightened and he 
replied firmly. "You get 
trivial over hours, because 
that's all you get."

She can't miss achieving her goals 



Gemmer believes in Santa 



By STEPHANY HOLMES 
Chief Reporter 

"Most men live lives of 
quiet desperation," it has 
been said. Thanks to in- 
flation, limited resources, 
and limited time, so do a lot 
of students. 

Susie Gemmer, 32, is a full- 
. time student, part-time 
employee, and divorced 
mother- of two, , quietly 
struggling to better herself 
; and support a family at the 
same lime. 

Like many divorced 

- mothers, she does not 
." receive much child support. 
I so what she earns as a 
; cashier, 24 hours a week at 
; Wolohan Lumber, has to 

• stretch to cover almost all of 
I her expenses. 

I '"We barely make it. After 
; I pay bills and sparingly buy 

• groceries, the money is gone. 

• If anything else comes up, 

• like medical problems or 
t cerlainrepairs.wegoindebt 
; or go without," Gemmer 
t said. 

- She Is finding ways to cope 

- and survive, though. She is 
'- learning to make her own 
'. repairs, her friends help 

• whenever they can, and the 
■ boys participate in a free 

- lunch program atschool. 

"It helps to know the kids 
'- are getting at least onewell- 
3 balanced, nutritious meal a 
i day through (he lunch 

- program. It lakes some of 

- the pressure off when there 

- isn't the time or money to 
'. prepare the type of good food 
' we should be eating. Food is 
] getting to be more of a 

budget problem all the 
time," she said. 

Clothing for her growing 
boys, John, 12, and 
I Christopher, 9, has been a 
' problem, too, but this year a 
friend gave her plenty of 
good quality hand-me-down 
items thai she said helped 
her budget enormously. 

The quality of her 
children's lives right now is 



of Gemmer's main 
'I don't care about 
material possessions or 
things for 'show ' I just don't 
want them to feel different 
from other children. It hurts 
when there 's no extra money 
and I have to say no to roller 
skating, field trips, and even 
getting bicycles fixed. 

"Chris once asked me 
'How did we get so poor?' I 
tried to explain, but it was 
hard for him to understand. 
Once he went for a very' long 
time without his bike 
because it needed repairs we 
couldn't afford. He was 
really unhappy about it. so I 
finally decided lo try and fix 
it myself. I tore it down and 
took in a part that seemed to 
be worn and asked for a 
replacement I was able to 
fix that bike for a fraction of 
what a repair shop would 
have charged. 

"Now, if I need new spark 
plugs in the car, or 
whatever, I just gel a book 
out and figure out how lo do 
it myself. 1 am learning how 
lo patch, build, or repair 
whatever I need lo survive," 
she said. 

Her building skills were 
going lo play a major role in 
Christmas this year, but 
something happened to 
change her plans. 

"There was no money to 
buy anything for the boys, so 
I was going lo gel some 
material from the lumber 
company and build them 
each a desk. Then recently, 
an envelope came in the 
mail, and when I opened it, a 
cashier's check for $100 fell 
out. It was signed 'Merry 
Christmas, Sanla — ho-ho — 
Claus.' It was for the boys, 1 
knew, and that, in itself, was 
agiftforme," 

Who does she think sent it? 

"Santa Claus — after this, 
I'm a believer! Actually, I 
don't have any idea. Just 
someone out there who loves 
who beli 



me, 1 guess. Knowing 
someone cares like that 
keeps you going and helps 
you survive. " 

Limited time, as well as 
limited funds, also poses a 
survival problem for 
Gemmer, who feels lorn by 
her responsibilities. 

"I feel guilty about how I 
spend my time, no matter 
how I spend it. When I'm not 
actually al work or in class, I 
don't know whether to study, 
spend lime with my kids, do 
some housework or laundry, 
see my friends or just do 
some much-needed 
relaxing, "she said. 

"I end up feeling 
fragmented. I'm not giving 
my besl anywhere — not as a 
student, mother, friend, or 
employee." She even feels 
thai her schedule leaves no 
time for dating. 

"Personal relationships of 
that nature are draining and 
take &lt;loo much lime and 
energy. Something had to go, 
al least for awhile. For now, 
1 am satisfied that I am 
finding 'ME, and getting 
closer to myself everyday." 

Despite a generally op- 
timistic and determined 
attitude, C-emmer has her 
worries, loo. 

"Living like this can take 
its toll. I am terrified of 
getting sick. There isn'l 
anyone taking care of the 
three of us but me. I'm it. I 
would also fall hopelessly 
behind in my schoolwork. 

getting really sick. 

"The spirit can get weary, 
as well. The overdue notices 
come in, (here's nothing left 
in the bank, and there's 
nothing left of you, either. 
Thai's when I call my friends 
for emotional support. They 
fill me up again and keep me 
going. I couldn't make it 
without Ihem," she said. 

Even though there is 
hardship in the life she has 
chosen. Gemmer believes 




she has picked the right 
path. 

"I do wonder sometimes if 
it is worth putting myself 
and my kids through this, but 
the answer is always yes. I 
want a beller life for myself 
and my boys. I want them to 
know that it is possible to 
better yourself no matter 
what age or sex you are or 
where you're coming from in 
life If that lesson, alone, 
gets through (o them, it will 
have been worth the effort , 

"This is for me, too. I want 
to be more creative, more 
accomplished, more me. I 
want to be the best thai I can 
be and know that my besl 
can help others. Iknowilwill 
be a long, rough haul, but I 
think my dream is worth it." 

Something she finds en- 
couraging is thinking beyond* 
her current situation to the 
future she is building for 

"In five years, 1 hope to 
have a job where I can use 
my creative skills and where 
my empathy for people is 
useful, instead of an ob- 
stacle. 

"I want (o reach out to new 
experiences for myself and 
my boys, without constant 
financial concern. I would 
like lo be able to provide 
some of the things the kids 
are missing now. Not that I 
am into materialism — I 
want them to know the 
richness of life, not the 

"Most of all, I want the 
peace of mind that comes 
from being able to take care 
of yourself and your family

and satisfaction," she said. 

There's every reason to 
expect that Susie will one 
day achieve her goal and

Adjustment to college life 
is the major problem con- 
fronting handicapped 
students at IPFW according 
to Debbie Grimm, counselor 
for disabled students. 
"Disabled students are not 
as prepared for college life," 
Grimm said, "but once they 
make the adjustment, 
college is not too difficult. 
The students in wheelchairs 
have it harder in the winter 
because of the snow." 

In the last five years 
conditions for the han- 
dicapped on campus have 
improved tremendously, 
Grimm said. She cited the 
push button doors, lower 
telephones and drinking 
fountains, and specially 
constructed restrooms as 
some of the major im- 
provements. 

"People are much more 
aware that the handicapped 
are here," Grimm said. 

"There has been an in- 
crease in disabled college 
students." She attributed the 



to the

50" 



Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 
The act says that every 
qualified handicapped 
studenl must be allowed into 
college. 



"'Qualified' means that 
the disabled studenl must be 
able to meet the'standards 
set by the college," Grimm 
explained. "The college can 
not lower its standards in 
order to accept a disabled 
student." 

Grimm also cited some 
special provisions that have 
been made for disabled 
students on the IPFW 
campus. In (he Helmke 
Library, in room 304. (here is 
special equipment for the 
handicapped, Grimm said. 
The equipment includes a 
Visual Tek which magnifies 
print 60 times, a talking 
calculator, a brail wrilerand 
special (ypewrilers. There is 
also a sound proof module 
for recording textbooks on 
tape. 

John Hart, a blind student 
here, said the major problem 
he faced when he first 
started college was getting 
access to recorded books. 
"The textbooks are recorded 
on tape," Hart said, "and 
often the one I needed was 
not available." 

Hart said he has not made 
use of any of the special 
equipment in room 340Ayet, 
but he plans to this semester. 



DID YOU KNOW?

plants are sensitive to their

The British may be better students but ... 



Cantor is glad to be back home 



By HELEN BUSCHEY 
CHIEF REPORTER 

London is a nice place to go 
as an exchange professor, 
bul Louis Cantor, associate 
professor of history at IP- 
FW, wouldn't necessarily 
want to live Ihere. 

Canlor returned home last 
July from the City of London 
Polytechnic University, 
where he had swapped 
leaching assignments for 
one year with Iwan Morgan. 
Morgan, in turn, taught 
Cantor's classes during the 
same time at IPFW. 

The professor exchange 
program is much like the 
student exchange, except 
(hot the professors also 
exchange such things as 
homes, cars, books, offices 
and leaching respon- 
sibilities. 

"London Polytechnic is 
technically not a univer- 
sity," Cantor said. "There 
are polytechnics and 



Sill. 



bul

sweatshirt he got while an exclionge professor in I»ndun. (Photo by Julie Zcntl . 



(polytechnic) Is a 4-year, co- 
ed, liberal arls ins(i(ution 
with on enrollment near that 
of IPFW." The leaching 
assignment* of Canlor and 
Morgan were both in 
American history. 

The students at London 
Pulylechnlc come from simi- 
lar socio-economic 

backgrounds as Hie students 
here Many of Ihe students 



have jobs and go (o school. 

"You have to be careful 
about generalizations," 
Cantor explained, "bul the 
British are better students. 
They write much better and 
handle the language belter; 
after all, it's their language, 
it's ours too, but we've 
botched it up prelty badly. 

"There is more of a 
weeding out process in the 
British system. Education is 
still reserved for the in- 
tellectual elite. It is more of 
a- privilege to go to the 
university (here lhan it is 
here, and as a result, you 
lend to get o much better 
studenl," Canlor said. 

"American students, on 
the other hand, perform 
better in class, and are more 
willing lo talk," Canlor 
continued. The British tend 
to be more formal, whereas 
Americans are more 
gregarious and goralous and 
will just go on and on, So if I 
hud lo sum up the dif- 
ferences, I would say that 
Ihe British student writes 
better and the American 
studenl talks more and 
performs belter In class," 
Cantor said. 

And what was the British 
student's reaction to Cantor? 
"They Ihoughl I was unique. 
They Ihoughl I was quaint," 
Canlor replied wilh a grin. 
"They sorl of tolerated me.' 



They were intrigued by my 
southern accent. They Itiink 
we are still part of the 
colonics, and ihey are not 
really sure we are com- 
pletely free yet. It was fun. 

"They are fascinated by 
the United Slates. We are the 
great mecca. ..the Rome and 
Athens of our day. But in 
another way, we are 
primilive. They think we all 
have guns under our pillows. 
It's a sorl of media piclure 
that they have of us," said 
Canlor. 

Just as in Ihe U.S., crime is 
growing in England. 
especially in London and 
other big cities. The house 
Cantor lived in was broken 
into twice while he was living 
there, and his guitar was 
stolen. "I don't want to give 
a negative impression," 
Cantor explained. "London 
is a fantastic town, a great 
place with very positive 
attributes, and it was a 
wonderful experience and 
worthwhile. II is a big city, 
and it has big city problems. 

"The positive side is lhal 
you have all (hose cultural 
advantages, The problem 
you suffer is 'over-choice.' 
You have too many things lo 
do You can gel into jus! 
aboul 'anything — theater, 
ballet, and even then, you 
can get really specialized, 



like Japanese opera or old 

"It's really extraordinary 
in that sense," Cantor 
continued, "In regard to 
coming back to Fort Wayne, 
it's nice lo get back and just 
lay back und mellow out. 
You suffer from big-city 
burnout Of course, now that 
I've been back for several 
months, I'm ready lo go back 
and suffer some more of 
those choices. That part of it 
was nice." 

Cantor was able lo travel 
into western Europe several 
times on school holidays. On 
the 1979 Chrisimas break, he 
had (he opportunity to visit 
Leningrad, where he strolled 
around and played tourist. 
The people wer,e extremely 
nice, especially when they 
found out he was an 
American, Ihey usually went 
ou 1 . of their way to be 
pleasant, Many of the 
Russians spoke English, and 
Cantor was impressed wilh 
the openness he en- 
countered. On of the things 
noticed by Cantor while in 
Ihe U.S.S R. was thai there 
were 'shortages of many 
things, and people stood in 
line to buy consumer goods. 

"Everyone asks me aboul 
Ihe differences in the 
cultures I observed." Cantor 
said IhroughtfuHy, as he 
leaned back in his chair and 



studied the ball-point pen in 
his hand, "but it is the 
sameness you realize. There 
is a sameness to the big city 
whether you are living in 
New York, London, Paris or' 
Berlin. We have become a 
global village, in the sense 
that everyone is tuned to the 
same wavelength. I thought 
this before I went over, but il 
really came through while I 
was there There is less 
difference between 
American and British than 
there is between big city 
versus the small town. 

"The whole experience' 
would have been different if I 
had been living in Bath or 
some other small town in! 
England in the same way it' 
would have been different 
for a British prof to have;, 
lived in New York as op-&gt;, 
posed to Muncie, Indiana." \ 

What was the most im- 
portant thing he brought 
back? "Myself!" he quickly 
exclaimed, And, what did he 
miss the mosl while he was 
gone? His friends and people 
in general, and the freedom 
lo get away out into Ihe 
country in 1(1 minutes like he 
can in Fort Wayne. 

"The professor exchange., 
program is a good one, and 
my year in London was a 
very worthwhile ex-.

"Man is physically closer 
than he's ever been and yet 
we are also more alienated 
socially than we've ever 
been." said Terry Doran, 
director of Thealer For 
Ideas (TFI&gt;. 

"Things hove become so 
taken over by experts that 
little breathing space 
remains for the average 
individual. A lot of people 
feel that because they aren't 
an expert in a given area, 
they can't or shouldn't 
publicly comment on it. 
Hopefully, through TFI we 
can help bring the experts 
and the common man closer 
to an understanding." 

The concept for Thealer 
For Ideas extends back to 
the first town hall meetings. 
"In today's society there are 
very few ways for the 
common man to convey his 
ideas lo the masses," Doran 
said, "In TFI we offer an 
informally structured 
discussion geared toward the 
layman, similar to "Face The 
Nation' but not as formal." 

Ironically, TFI's first 
program in 1972 was on the 
same topic as the opening 
show Jan. 9, 1981, the con- 
troversy over rock 'n' roll in 
the Memorial Coliseum. 
Doran shoots for topics that 
are, for the most part, 
relevant lo the local com- 
munity. "We had to lay off 
for two years due to a lack of 
funding and a place to hold 
the program. The lack of 
stability severely hurt us. 
One week we would be in a 
church basement and the 
next week you could find us 
at the Fort Wayne Art 



School. You can't develop 
much of a following if they 
can't find you." 

Now holding shop in the 
downtown library's new 
auditorium, TFI's premiere 
program came as a major 
success. The topic dealt wilh 
the goals of a group called 
RESCUE and its attempt to 
condemn rock 'n' roll as 
immoral. 

Doran had a panel con- 
sisting of News-Sentinel 
Editor Ernest Williams, 
IPFW communications 
professor Janet Roncelli, 
WXKE Radio Manager Art 
Templar, and Rev. James 
Bachman, founder of 
RESCUE. 

Bachman, who has stated 
that Templar is part of the 
problem, came off as being 
uninformed and narrow 
minded. He apparently look 
lyrics and statements 
completely oul of context to 
substantiate his own views. 
He staled that his whole 
purpose Is to save today's 
youth from the immorality 
of rock music. 

On the 'other hand, 
Templar had done his 
homework. He presented 
scriptures that are relevant 
to Bachman's in- 

terpretations of the Bible. He 
also presented a letter 
allegedly written by some of 
the young members of Bach- 
man's church who were 
unhappy with the Reverend 
and bored with the church. 

Theater for Ideas is 
broadcast live on Friday 
nights at 8 p.m. on the public 
access cable channel, 
Channel 10. The programs 
are also rebroadcast 
Wednesdays at 7 p.m. 




Dee Russell appear* as 
Presbyterian Theater's produclit 

Best staged recently 



John Day In First 



Play enjoyed by all 



By HELEN BUSHEY 
CHIEF REPORTER 

"Life With Father" could 
really have been titled. "Life 
With Mother," because of 
the way Jean Cocks, as 
"Vinnie" or Mother, clearly 
dominates the cast of 
characters in this familiar 
and popular three-act play. 

The play, one of America's 
comic treasures, opened 
Friday night, January 9, 
1981, at First Presbyterian 
Theater, and runs through 
this weekend, January 16, 17 
and 18 with three more 
performances. 

The play, written by 
Howard Lindsay and Russell 
Crouse, is currently directed 
by Harvey Cocks, who was a 



member of the New York 
production. "Life With 
Father" is very well cast 
and staged, and is certainly 
one of the best all-around 
productions of the First 
Presbylerian stage in a 
while. 

This delightful comedy 
about upper-class family life 
in New York in the late 1880's 
was written from the 
memoirs of Clarence Day Jr. 
and highlights the day-to- 
day life of the Day family. 
James Walker aptly por- 
trays the domineering, yel 
lovable Father, and Dee 
Russell the eldest son, 
Clarence Junior. They are 
supported by the three 
younger brothers played by 



Keith Daniels, Thomas 
Savage and J. Scott 
Derringer. 

Ladonna Huntley as 
Cousin , Cora, and Judi 
Hoagland as Mary, the Day 
family's two visiting 
relatives from Ohio, add 
color and excitement, and in 
Ihe character of Mary, a love 
interest for son Clarence Jr. 

The play is fast moving 
and is truly family rated 
entertainment. The Sunday 
matinee with its near 
capacity audience, was a 
mix of all ages, and judging 
from the sound of frequent 
laughter and the generous 
applause, was enjoyed by 
all.

ByMIKECEFFEN 
Chief Reporter 

1980 was a bad year for 
movies, and the Christmas 
releases by the major 
studios are indicative of that 
fact. With few exceptions. 
namely "Popeye" and two 
films I saw out of town, 
"Raging Bull" and 
"Tribute," the films can be 
summed up in one word: 
disappointing. If films could 
be exchanged like gifts, the 
public should return most of 
the Christmas releases. 

After the three films 
mentioned above, the quality 
scale dips way down The 
poor quality of the rest of the 
films can be attributed to a 
single problem, rotten 
scripts. 

The films which were most 
disappointing, considering 
their potential, were "Nine 
lo Five." "Stir Crazy," 
"Seems Like Old Times," 
and "The Formula." These 
films are typical of the other 
movies this season that have 
fine performers in them who 
are given nothing lo do. 

"Popeye" is the only 
flawless film I his season. 
Robert Altman's Uve-actlon 
cartoon demonstrates the 



magic of film Robin 
Williams, Shelly Duval! and 
Paul Dooley are the perfect 
embodiment of their 
characters. Jules Fieffer's 
script captures the wit and 
whimsy of E. C. Seegar's 
creations wilh precision. The 
film has something for 
everyone. There is comic 
action for the kids and 
Altman's darkly-edged 
satire for the adults. It is a 
magical film and a mar- 
velous Christmas present. 

"Nine lo Five" is an en- 
tertaining film" that un- 
fortunately degenerates into 
contrived slapstick. Jane 
Fonda, Lily Tomlin and 
Dolly Parlon are good and 
save the film from being a 
tolal waste. The film starts 
out as a tough satire on office 
politics but slides into 
predictable and trile slap- 
stick. 

The director and co- 
scriptwriter Colin Higgins 
doesn'l seem to know if he 
wants lo make a lough 
feminist satire or please the 
folks in Peoria wilh a simple 
comedy. This indecision 
accounts for the film's split 
and makes what could have 
been a thought-provoking 



comedy into a mindless 
exercise, 

"The Formula"* has 
nothing to recommend it 
other lhan Marlon Brando 
and George C, Scott. These 
two fine actors are stranded 
in this otherwise dismal spy 
"thriller." John G. Avild- 
sen's direction is sluggish 
and Ihe film becomes boring. 
Instead of showing us Ihe 
dangerous risks, like -Hitch- 1 
cock would have, Avildsen 
has endless close-ups of 
Scott droning on about the 
maze of intrigue he's "en- 
tering. II is a pity that Scotl 
and Brando couldn't have 
been given a better vehicle 
for their teaming. 

Like the film mentioned 
above, "Stir Crazy" has 
nothing lo recommend it bul 
its two stars. Gene Wilder 
and Richard Pryor are 
excellent, but their energy is 
the only spark in this dumb 
comedy. 

There is simply no excuse 
for the haphazard script by 
Bruce Jay Friedman Sidney 
Porlier's direction can't 
cover up the holes in the 
script and he seems lo have 
no sense of rhyihm. This is a 
comedy with no point to it. 



"Seems Like Old Times" 
is Neil Simon's stupid rehash 
of a Thirlies screwball 
comedy. Simon's film wants 
lo be an Eighties version of 
films like "Bringing Up 
Baby" and "The Awful 
Truth." However, those 
films have one thing this one 
lacks, likeable characters. 
"Seems Like Old Times" is 
full of caricatures, not 
characters, and not even the 
charm of Goldie Hawn can 
save it. It is a repetilious 
comedy vastly inferior to 
Simon's "Goodbye Girl." 

"Flash Gordon" in a self 
conscious throwback lo the 
old Universal serials. The 
program with "Flash Gor- 
don" is that Ihe filmmakers 
play it too cute and campy. 
Imagine the T.V. series 
"Batman" in outer space 
and you get the film's lone. K 
is played like (he old serials, 
and in fact borrows many 
plot elements from (hem, but 
needs something to put some 
life into il. 

"Firs! Family" is Buck 
Henry's sorry attempt at 
political satire. The droll 
satirical comedy Henry is 
known for from his ap- 
pearances on "Saturday 



Night Live" and "The 
Tonight Show" is nowhere lo 
be found in this unfunny, 
tasteless comedy. The film 
totally wastes the talents of 
BobNewhart, Gilda Radner, 
Madalene Kahn and a 
supporting cast of many fine 
comic actors. II is one of the 
worst films this season. 

"A Change of Seasons" 
exists for no olher reason 
than lo show off Bo Derek 
bobbing up and down in a hoi 
tub with Anthony Hopkins. 
The film aspires to be an 
Eighties version of "Bob and 
Carol And Ted and Alice" 
but unfortunately asks none 
of Ihe questions thai film 
asked. A good performance 
by Anthony Hopkins is about 
the only thing (his film has lo 
offer. 

"Any Which Way You 
Can" is a boring sequel to 
"Every Which Way Bul 
Loose." This film has 
everything the first one had 
only more so. More of Clyde, 
more of Ruth Gordon's dotty 
old woman schlik, more of 
Clin! Eastwood's knocking 
oui the camera lens. We've 
seen this all before and it 
doesn't get any better the 
second timearound.

Exhibit opens 

Abstract art shown 



By TIM SMITH 
Slafr Writer 

An extensive exhibition of 
Ihe works of arlisl Maurice 
Golubov is now being hosted 
by The Fort Wayne Museum 
of Art, located at 1202 W. 
Wayne St. The showing, 
entitled "Maurice Golubov: 
Paintings 1925-1980," is a 
relrospeclive display of 
Golubov's pioneering work 
in the field of abstract art. 

The collection was put 
together by Daniel J, 
Cameron, who feels thai a 
display of Golubov's work is 
necessary at this time. 
Artists like Golubov have 
recently become more ac- 
cepted now that abstract art 
is seen as a developing art 
form not strictly limited, as 
previously believed by 
critics, by a* few basic 



principles of form and 

Golubov was born near 
Kiev, Russia, in 1905, and 
lived there until 1917 when he 
and his family fled to escape 
the persecution brought on 
by the Bolshevik revolution. 
At age 14 Golubov dropped 
out of high school to pursue a 
career in painting. He took 
work in a commercial art 
studio and later worked in 
fashion illustration at 
Montgomery Ward and 
Sears- Roebuck, then retired 
in 1967. 

With' Cezanne as his 

principle influence, Golubov 
went on independently in 
pursuit of his painting 
aspirations. His goal, in his 
words, was to give visual 
expression to the "fourth 
dimension; the realm 



beyond the physical." This 
idea often appears quite 
strongly in his art, which is 
al times well in the sphere of 
surrealism. An individual 
example of this surrealism 
can be seen in Golubov's 1970 
painting entitled 

"Metropolis." 

The 10E paintings, con- 
tributed to the showing by 
individual collectors and 
museums from all over the 
United States, will be on 
display until Feb. 1 at both 
the art museum and the 
Performing Arts Center. 
Admission is free and a 
major catalog of the Golubov 
exhibit is on sale at the art 
museum. Museum hours arc 
Sunday through Thursday 
from l-S p.m., U a.m. to 5 
p.m. on Friday, and 10 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. on Saturday. The 
museum is closed Mondays.

The holiday break brought 
some inconsistent play from 
the men's basketball learn, 
but (here is no doubt thai the 
Tuskers are finally on their 
way to a respectable season. 
As of Dec. 6, 19B0 the team 
record was -1-3 for the season 
after a double victory at the 
Sertoma Tourney. But then a 
Dec. lOtli home game 
brought a defeat as Hope 
upset the Tuskers 81-59. 
Head coach Ken Workman 
said of the game that "the 
level of play was not the 
( same as at the city tour- 
nament due to mental 
flatness. You're working 
hard, but vou're a step 
behind." 

And being a step behind 
can often make the dif- 
ference. With IPFWdownby 
nine and six minutes to play. 
Hope blew the Tuskers out 
by scoring 27 more points. 
However, Junior Rickie

compelilion between IPFW 
and Indiana University East 
on Dec. 20. showed how the 
Tuskers could come back 
and pull out a victory in a 
light ball game. 

The East team was bigger 
and quicker than the 
Tuskers, but as Coach Work- 
man described it, "We had 
our spurt right at the end." 
With four minutes to play 
and the Tuskers (railing TO- 
ES, Workman said, "You 
take the ball to (he people 
who can get the job done. 
Rickie Smith and Gary 
Rinard." The final score was 
81-79, with Smith hilling 28 
points and Rinard adding 26 
in the Tusker win. 

IPFW grabbed another 
win on Jan. 3 against St. 
Francis, 73-66. Though the 
Tuskers won. they showed a 



2nd half letdown after 
rough, aggressive begin- 
ning. 

Al half lime the IPFW 
team lead 38-25, but St. 
Francis capitalized on the 
Tusker's errors and chopped 
the lead down to only (wo 
points by Ihe final three 
minutes of play. 

The Tuskers then came 
back in full style and hit 10 
conseculive free throws in 
the last minute and 48 
seconds. The field goal clip 
was 48 percent with Rinard 
scoring 22 points and Brian 
Grady 10. 

The "back and forth" 
effect continued with a. loss 
(o Huntington on Jan. 6. 
Workman summed up the 
team's performance as an 
"inadequate fulfillment of 
player responsibilities (hat 
contributed to a subpar team 
performance. We just 
weren't able to play our true 
style of basketball." This, 
Huntington continually took 



hung in with a one point lead 
and Rinard shot (wo from 
the charity stripe, giving the 
Tu5kersa79-76victory. 

Smith again led the 
scoring with 35 points, with 
Rinard and Grady adding 17 
each. The team hit an ex- 
cellent 63 percent from (he 
field. 

With a 7-5 season record, 
the IPFW team Is now 
beginning to lake on signs of 
an impressive ballclub, 
especially with dynamic 
Rickie Smith who is 
currently ranked In the top

before and after the holiday 
season in a 5 game bid 
against the following 
competitors: Marian, St.

Marian Sue Hendricks led 
Ihe Tuskers by basketting 24

Peggy Voisin commented on 
the third game of the season 
as "a learning experience." 

The Tuskers bombed 
division II St. Francis by a 
whopping score of 68-39. 
They broke a school record 
by earning 24 steals. Hen- 
dricks contributed 14 of 
these steals and led the 
scoring with 25 points,

In competition against

squad broke another school 
record and scored in a high

described the game as "the 
most exciting basketball 
game" during her coaching 
career. 

During the first half, (he

12 points. But (he second half 
was the turning point as (hey
