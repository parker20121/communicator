I was walking in Kettler. 
and when 1 turned the cor-

of the numerous couches. I 
thought that i( was a weird 
place to lie down, but as 1 
approached this girl, I real-

smiled to myself because 
she actually looked pretty 
comfortable.

times I slept in the cafeteria

One second you are

is leaving. It's the kind of 
sleep your body Just dictates

you having a choice in the 
matter. That kind of sleep. 

Clauroom Medical anil saw a

He was In a sllghtlj different

was a bit annoyed because he 
was onjoyinB something that I 
was lacking. But, on the other 
hand, it is nice to know that 
the students on this campus 
felt safe. 

ivanted to I could probablj 
just la] down on one of the 
many couches on campus 
and not be bothered. 

This seems like such a 
small thing, but in actualit) it 
is a very important thing, 
and It says a great deal about 
the students of the campus.

that Santa Claui would come down the 
chimney and fill up our red Christmas 
stockings. Many children would recei^e 
treasured gifts and others would get the 
dreaded sock full of coal. 

We are all grown up now and 
Christmas has changed. As a child, it is 
a magical experience full of wondrous 
toys, books, clothes and gadgets. As we 
get older our needs and wants have 
advanced. !i has been a tradition at The 
Communicator for the past few years to 
share our aspirations of the holidaj 
season with \ou. 

In realiti we are full) aware that 
the changes or goals that we want to 
achieve cannot be brought to us b]'- a 
(oil)- gentleman with lit inkling eyes but 
through hard work and discipline. 

Howev'er, there are some things in 
life that seem to "just happen" without 
an) control. Perhaps St. Nick will once 
again magicall) Kranl our requests. We 



hope that our desires inspire )ou and 
give &gt;ou ideas aboul this festive lime. 
Knjoy, 

First of all. we all would like our 
lives to be a little less hectic. Perhaps 
drivers on campus will not cut off other 
drivers in the roundabout. Bomb 
threats being a thing of the permanent 
past would he excellent. They have 
gone as far back as the early seventies. 
Enough is enough. 

One more small thing we would 
like From the campus communit) is to 
pick up trash and stop leaving garbage 
in the parking areas. Being considerate 
of other people would cause everyone a 
little less stress. 

We will always want people to get 

Somcda)' we hope that by word-of- 
mouth this campus can be known as a 
place that is humming with student life. 
More though tfulncss and student 
activity are two simple concepts we 
would like to see in the campus commu- 
nity . We also have ideas for ourselves. 

For Adam: a different phone number 
to stop weird people from cahing, new 
e) es so he can drive at night and a new 
knee so he can go up stairs again. 

For Mishanna: a car that works, ; 
kc) chain that doesn't disappear, and : 
watch tu remind her she's late again. 



For Eric Tarr: a clean, uncluttered 
working area, designated for him In the 
ofnce. 



For Greg: a huge going away part). 
He deserves it after so man&gt; years of 
hard work in this office. 

For Dorie: some sunscreen for her 

office and a vacation because she is 
such a great person. 

For the entire staff: more writers 
that are responsible and reliable, a 
scanner and some graphic art, more 
than 24 hours on Tuesdaj so we have 
more time before deadline, a refrigera- 
tor so we don't alwavs have to bu)' food 
from Ihe cafeteria and a television so 
Brian can watch sporting events in the 
office. 

For everyone around the world: a

WWF shouldn't have to tone product down 




watched as the World 
Wrestling Federadon 
has come under the 



Television 

Council. The PTC is 
claiming that the 
WWF'i product Is 
unsuitable foi 



either tc 



nd that the 



WWF should be madi 
down Its product or be 

jved from television. Although I 
do agree with the reasoning ihat 
wrestling is too explicit for children, 1 
don't personally sec the need for 
U to be removed from television 
altogether. 

Wrestling has for years been 
marketed towards children. A prime 
e.\ample of this is the \VWF wrestling 
cartoon that ran on Saturday morn- 
ings In the SOs. However, It has 
also found a strong demographic 
among adults, cspeciall)' In such 
organizations as the ECW 



Ediloria! Board 



(Extreme Championship Wrestling), 
which recently found a cable home 
on The Nashville Network. Wrestling 
action figures and other merchandise 
are made specifically for kids, but 
the stor)'lines involved in wrestling 
are more adult-oriented than any- 
thing else. 1 honestly believe that 
instead of toning down its product, 
the WWF should consider targeting 
males above IB as their key demo- 
graphic and move their show to a 
lime when children wouldn't be able 
to watch it. 

This sort of thing has alrcad)- 
occurred in Fort Wayne in terms of 
WWF's "Smackdown" show on 
Thursday nighL This show Ls the one 
the PTC is directing most of its 
assaults towards, probabl) because 
It's on the UPN network (a recog- 
nized network) and it's scheduled for 
an cart) time in the 8 p,m, to 10 p,m. 
Slot In cities in which it's available. In 
Fort Wa)ne. the UPN network Isn't 
available. Instead, people wishing to 
view UPN shows are made to watch 
them on Super 55 (Fo\) at different 

Contecf Us! 



hours instead. Since Fo\ has Its own 
programming on during the time 
"Smackdown" is scheduled and the) 
wouldn't dare promote a rival net- 
work's show by replacing one of their 
own shows with one of UPN's, the 
result is that "Smackdown" Is played 
at 1 a,m, Frida) morning. 

Although I would never encour- 
age any show to be moved to such a 
late time, 1 personally see nothing 
wrong with moving an adult-oriented 
show (such as the WWF's "Raw" and 
"Smackdown") to a 10 p.m. time slot. 
This, of course, works for the major 
network shows such as "NYPD Blue," 
"ER" and all of Fox's real life video 
programs. What is it that makes 
wrestling different from those t)pes 
of programs? The) 're all graphic In 
one form or another. The) all deal 
with issues that refiect societ). Is the 
onl) separating Factor between those 
shows and wrestling the fact that 
wrestling looks like an actual sportl I 
trul) hope the "sports" In "sports 
entenninmcnt" isn't being taken loo 
lllerall) , 



Though many wouldn't think a 
group such as the PTC could affect a 
billion-dollar company such as the 
WWF's parent company Titan Sports, 
man) of the WWF's major advertisers 
are dropping their btisiness due to 
the subject matter of the program. 
The WWF says they're having no 
problems selling the freed-up com- 
mercial time, but losing that son of 
business all at once no doubt has 
some sort of effect on morale at the 

looks to the public. 

Although this may seem like a 
threat right now, the WWF Is still 
enjoying much of Its original success 
since climbing into mainstream cul- 
ture. Even if it doesn't retain the 
popularit) it currently en)o)s, it 
should at least be able to retain the 
mone) it's made. Hopcfull) , some 
alternative Is reached and the WWF 
Isn't Forced to accept unreasonable 
demands as a result oF the PTC. 1 feel 
the) have a good program, geared 
towards adults, and it should remain 



Natural or 
artificial? 

by Mishatina Wood, 
Managing Editor 

Chrisimas day is only 

I 16 days away yet some 

' us still have to put 

a tree, decorate and 

V glfu. This tradition 

I definitel) runs strong 

1 m) famil) , We don't 

vcn have a Christmas 

about due For the annual debate 
about whether or not to get an arlifi- 
cial tree or a natural one. We usuall) 
have a natural tree; however, there 
are al«a)S complaints about all the 

Here are a fevv pros and cons 
that have been brought up ever) 
jear In mv famllj concerning the 
Christmas tree. They might help oth- 
ers resolve some of the issues related 
which t)pe of tree is best for their 
particular situation. 

Nothing can compare to the 
pine scent oF a natural tree. Aroma 
From the tree Is a natural air freshen- 
er that also focuses attention on the 
holiday centerfold. The actual event 
of going out and choosing the per- 
fect needled plant is an exciting fam- 
ily affair. Wreaths can be made out 
of the trimmings. 

Even though no wreaths can be 
made out oF an artificial tree, it is 
definitely less messy. The man-made 
tree can be conveniently stored in 
the closet or attic; therefore, an out- 
ing is unneccssar)' for those with lit- 
tle time. The limbs can be twisted to 
support ornaments. There Is no year- 
ly cost for a tree and there Is alwa) s 
plenty of room for presents on the 
tree skirt. They arc also convenient 
for smaller living quarters such as an 
apartment or a small home. 

Both natural and artiUcial trees 
are a hassle to "assemble." whether it 
be the tree stand or the tree limbs. 
The natural tree is extremely messy 
because it sheds needles onto every- 
thing in sight. Sap from the tree gets 
stuck to the fingers. Along with the 
mess, we take a piece oF nature with 
ever; Christmas tree we buy. These 
trees need a full stand oF water to 
slow down the dr)ing out process. 
In addition to care, it is difficult to 
bring it home and dispose of it due 
to bulkiness.

Choosing a tree is only the first

both need decorations. However this 
process can get a little technical.

Colored Sands Glass Company brings glass art to Fort Wayne 



by Eric Baus. 
Features Editor 



Colored Sands 
Company is a new Fort Wayne 
builneis owned and apcraicd 
bj' Todd Taylor and IPFW slu- 
dcnl Frank Oddou. Glass

a street festival in Eugene and 
1 spent the day talking lo him 
about his ci^ft. VVorking with 



After moving bark to Fort 
ne, Oddou became inier- 
rd in opening up a glass 




Glass artist Frank Oddou demonstrates a glassblovuing 
technique in the Colored Sands Glass Company studio. 



"We keep some supplies 
in stock, mainly glass, but we 
can order any tools for peo- 
ple," said Oddou. 

Colored Sands is 
equipped with a glassworking 
studio ivhere Taylor and 
Oddou offer classes that teacli 
beginners and advanced stu- 
dents several different glass- 
working techniques. The ivcU- 
veniilaicd studio includes Hve 
workstations comprised of 
propane torches and an army 
of tools and glass rods. 

Oddou describes the 
encounter that led him to 
become intorcstcil in glass art: 
*~ln earl) 1995, 1 ivas in 
fOicgon and 1 met a glnssblow- 



studio with his friend Todd 
Taylor. Since thai time, the 
two have worked hard prepar- 
ing for the opening of iheir 
"We opened the

since June," said Oddou. 

Oddou and Taylor use 
t(vo main types of glass: stan- 
dard soft glass, which costs 
anjvihere from S4 to SS per 

'PyrcN" which can cost up to 
SlOO per pound. 

According to Oddou, 
Colored Sands is the only pub&lt; 
lie access siudio of lis kind in 
Indiana. Colored Sands sells 
\ase»,&lt;perrume-bolile3, blotvn- 



glass figurines, Christmas 
ornaments, suncaichers. 
freeform sculpture, and other 



Oddou e.xplains how set- 
ting up a home studio can be 
verj c&gt;&lt;pensive: "When I start- 
ed, 1 worked tvio Jobs to sup- 
port m) shop so I could still 
blo» glass. ' 

Oddou said that the ini- 
tial costs for setting up a pri- 
vate shop can be from S800 to 
SISOO. 'Man) beginnen don't 
e\pect to waste as much glass 
as ihe&gt; do and that is where 
things get expensive," added 
Oddou. 

Oddou believes that 
Colored Sands provides an 
easier and less c\pcnsii e wa; 
for beginning glass artists to 
learn. "We sell studio time 
here for SIO an hour which 
includes everything but the 
glass, II you are just looking to 
be a hobbjist. that is a heck of 
a better deal than buying all 
vour own equipment," said 
Oddou. 

Colored Sands Glass 
Company currentlj- offers 
three different classes. The 
first and simplest is the bead 
class which meets on Mondaj 
nights from S:30 to 8 p.m. The 
cost for a one evening class is 
S35. In this mtroductor)' class, 
students are taught the basics 
of soft glass beadmaking 
techniques. 

Taylor and Oddou offer a 
four-week blown vessel class 
that meets from 5:30 lo 8 p.m. 
on Wednesdays. The cost of 
the blown vessel class is S165. 
Students gain e.&lt;iperience and 
learn techniques for working 
with Pyre\ tubing, rods and 
colored glass. 

A four-week beginning 
figurine class is offered on 
Thursday evenings. The cost 
of the class is SIGS and stu- 
dents learn how to work with 
and sculpt solid glass rods 
ranging from 5-lS mm. 
Students learn techniques lo

Move to Division I makes 'cents' 



last week. Todd Armstrong, in 
his le[[er [o [he editor "Move to 
Division I doesn't add up,' raised a 
few pertinent questions about our 
projected move to NCAA Division [ 
status. 1 would like to use this 
opportunity to address those issues. 

Conference AFniiaiion: The 
Mid-Continent Conference would be 
a perfect fi[ for IPFW for a number 
of reasons. Flrs[, our sis[er insdtu- 
lion (lUPUII. Is a member and would 
provide a natural in-state rivalry, 
much like Purdue and Indiana. 
Secondly, the Mid-Condnenl cur- 
rency has nine member insdiutions 
and needs a lOih to balance the 
conference for scheduling purposes. 
1 do agree that the Mid-Continent is 
stretched geographically. However, 
we are compadble from an Ideologi- 



I « 
while 






ut [ha[ 
othci 



found that ihey either require foot- 
ball or alcead) had an equal num- 
ber of conference members and 
were not looking for expansion. 
Most conferences made up of pri- 
\'ate colleges and universities would 
prefer not to be linked with slate 



Facilities: With pristine new 
soccer fields (14) and tennis courts 
(6), along with refurbished baseball 
and Softball fields, our racllliies arc 
more than lufHclent for Division I. 
Additional]), the Gales Center, 
which would host basketball and 
volle}ball competition, meets Mid- 
Conlincn[ Conference S[andards. As 
a mailer of fact, for the next three 
years while ihe Mld-Contineni 
Conference Baskeiball 
Cham 



. inshlps lake place at the 
(jillseum, IPFW will be the host sKe 
for all of the teams to pracdce. 

Compctiiion: Mr. Armstrong 
has a valid point in the competitlvc- 
ntss of IPFW athleilc programs with- 
in the GLVC In falmess, K should be Ing lo Divi 
pointed oui that all of our teams 
have less than 30 percent funding 



of a[hletic scholarships as compared 
to other member inslliutions. Yet, in 
spite of this difference, our men's 
volleyball is a national powerhouse, 
our men's soccer team advanced to 
the Bite Eight and our women's vol- 
leyball and tennis [cams each posi- 
ed outstanding records while nnish- 
ing second in the conference. Our 
women's basketball program (cur- 
rently 4-2) and our men's basketball 
(curn:ntl) -I'l) have already shown 
the abllii) lo play compcdtive bas- 
ketball wlih far fewer resources 
than oihcr GLVC memben. 

As a member of Division [, the 
'playing Teid' would be leveled as 
both basketball programs would 
have full funding, the same as 
Indiana and Purdue, and a number 
of our other programs would share 
increased funding. The NCAA 
requires 78 full scholarships which 
would clearly enhance our abilit)' to 
play and to be competitive within 
the Mld-ConiinenL Leadership from 
within our current conference and 
the Mid-Contincni have expressed 
to us that IPFW would Immediatel) 
be a viable contender. 

In a recent visit to ihe NCAA 
headquarters In Indianapolis, 
Director of Membership Services 
Jim Johnson, stated to me that IPFW 
is onlj one of two universities cur- 
rendj le};itimaicl] sei;king Division 
I status. In his opinion, all other col- 
leges and universities thai are In the 
talking stages h^ve no righ( to even 
consider a move toward Division I. 

Business leaders In Fort Wa)ne 
have rallied around our vision for 
NCAA Dislsion I. Even as this is 
being wri((en. phase one of a (hree- 
siagc project has been completed. 
Phase two will begin In Januar) and 
phase three is projected to start by 
summer. Those three phases would 
bring us SI million In addiilonal 
revenue which would more than ofT- 
the expenses necessary for mov- 



Divislon I program. Onl) one other 
communltj- our size in the countrj- 
(Bakersfield, Calif.) does not Have 
Division I athletics. Since Muncie 
{Ball State), Evansville, Bloomingion 
and West Lafayette are supporting 
Division I programs, certainly Fort 
Wayne is in a position to do like- 
wise. For our students, faculty, staff 
and administration, 1 sec the day 
when we host Indiana. Purdue and 
Noire Dame basketball in alternat- 
ing years at the Coliseum. In August 
2000, we will hosi seven Division 1 
soccer teams at the Hefner Fields 
and IPFW will play Indiana in the 
opening 



As « 



I the 



r the 2 1st 



cilon of 



dorms, we see uivision i status as 
one way to enhance student life on 
(he campus. We sec the combination 
of dorms and Division I as an alter- 

Unlversity or Purdue University. 
We see the dorm/Division 1 combi- 
nation as keeping more of our good 
students here in Fort Wa) ne and, 
consequently, larger numbers of 
students will choose lo settle In (his 
community upon gr.tduatlon. We 
sec our graduates appl)ing for (he 
bet(cr jobs that will become a\Jil- 
ablc and helping to promote ci^i&lt; 
pride in our communii) . This, com- 
bined with other ventures currenil; 
under consideration, wilt help moM: 
IPFW from a good universlt) to a 
great one. The transformation in 
academics, athletics, campus lite, 
community Interest and economic 
lmpac( in Northeast Indiana will 
project IPFW as the place to attend. 

I am proud to be here ser\'lng

look forward to working with each
