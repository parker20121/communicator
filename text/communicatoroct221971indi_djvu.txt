InPIRG organizes 
on IV—PIJ campus 

The Indiana Public Inter- 
est Research Group (InllHG) 
was started last spring at 
Bloomington, 

InPIRG is a student fund- 
ed organization attempting 
projects in the following a- 
reas: consumer affairs, cor- 
porate irresponsibility, 
health c^re, ecology, race 
and sex discrimination, oc- 
cupational, health and safe- 
ty, and other related areas. 

Credit courses are being 
given on Public Interest Re- 
search Groups in Minnesota 
and already serveal InPIRG 
students at Bloomington are 
being given credit for InPIRG 
related activities and re- 
search. 

Unlike student government, 
InPIRG will not be a one-cam- 
pus activity. Organizers 
have begun the process in a 
state-wide program costing 
the student 33 per year, mean- 
ing a guaranteed funding of 
about 8200,000 per year. 

The InPIRG concept is an 
idea conceived by consumer 
advocate Ralph Nader. The 
organization's idea is to use 
college students ' energies 
and concerns to bring about 
changes in the public inter- 
est, combining student fund- 
ing and research and a pro- 
fessional staff. 

Dr. Joe Highland, one of 
Nader's Raiders, visited the 
Indiana-Purdue Regional cam- 
pus Monday evening to speak 
on InPIRG. 

The student PIRG concept is 
extremely important. Highland 
said, because it provides stu- 
dents with the opportunity to 
work constructively to achieve 
changes.

Going through the neces-

than the battle itself.

FBI causes tragedy 

Dear Editors: 
At last it has happened. 
Once again t2&gt;:inr the bull by 
the horns, the F.B.I, has 
succeeded in causing a tri^f- 
edy i:. which an ir-nocent char- 
ter pjlot and an estranged 
v/ife were fiunned down by a 
panicked lunatic. 

Once again, as happened at 
Attica, the "ret tou/rh" rolicy 
of the authorities has led to 
needless killinp-. While we 
ma;, self-righteously claim 
that the puards at-Attice suf- 
fered from the hazards of their 
profession, there appearf to be 
no sufficient justification for 
the heartless coru.uct of F.3.I. 
agents in Jacl:sonville on Oct. 
4. 

Disregarding the pleas of 
the terror-stricken pilot, 
they panicked the skyjacker 
into the double slMyinc, not 
to mention his ovm suicide. 

It was bound to happen. Re- 
cently an agent shot a skyjack- 
er at Kennedy International 
while he walked with his gun 
at the stewardess' head. All 
turned out for the best, fort- 
unately, althoup;h a near miss 
could have r.eant the girls life. 

My question is this. When, 
where, and how did police aut- 
horities receive indiscriminate 
life and death powers? I was 
under the assumption that only 
due process of law could sen- 
tence a man to death, ana only 
by summarily conclusive evi- 
dence of rruilt. 

Cf c curse, we have lonr been 
rr^teful to r.r. Hoover for keep- 
ing us aware that t' ere is a 
dirty coraiie under every bed, 
but it seems that vJhei'j our po- 
lice forces car. shovi such ab- 
solute disregard and utter con- 
tempt for the lives of ho:-ta;-es 
we becoH-e no better than ot£l- 
inist Russia or 1-aoist China, 
'.-.here in the justice upon v/hich 
this country is bcsed. 

1 feel that vfhen v/e reach 
a point where human life means 
so little ai to be cast aside 
because of the vanity of a 
police organization, it is time 
that we stop and take stock of 
the situation. 

It also occurs to me th::t 
when hr. Hoover's orpsnization 
can shov/ no conpassion for thosi 
they are sworn to rrotect, per- 
haps we must cast a scrutiniz- 
ing eye toward that organisa- 
tion and revamp it into some- 
thing that can be respected ::nd 
honored instead of feared and 
mistrusted. 

It is a sad state of affairs 
But, as was heard in the back- 
ground of the F.A.A. tapes of 
the plane-control tower con- 
versation, "You can't win them 
ail," 
— Charlie J. Parrell 



'Excellent school newspaper* 

Deer tditors: 

'.ie appreciate t!ie rreat 
coveratre the Communicator has 
been rivin^ t"e Convocations 
prorrani this year. In pre- 
vious yct-rs the university 
newsraper had not served as 
a useful orgaii to publicize 
the student-funded progrars. 
The first two prcrraiDs .of 
the l';71-72 Convocations ser- 
ies drew more people than the 
combined attendance of last 
year's nine proi^rams. liuch 
credit for thissucce.s lies 
with tlie promotional and re- 
view efforts of your paper. 
l;early SJC,rOC of student 
money is invested in the Con- 
vocations program. We are 
proud to be sein/ing in the 
students' rights oriented ad- 
ministration of hark Franke 
and we are lucky to have, for 
the first time in years, an 
excellent school newspaper. 

Thanks again, 

Sharon Gabet and hark Souder

ResignB from Student Government 

Dear Editors: 

In the best interest of the 
wticle student body, (especially 
those who think that Government 
is a great thing) I am enclosing 
the followin--' letter. This is 
my second year of Student Gov't 
service and never before have 
I seen such incompetence in a 
bureaucracy and never again 
do I hope to see such a bunch 
of "do-nothings." 

Dear Ilark, 

As yet 1 have not been as- 
signed anything constructive 
to do. Since I have been wait- 
ing since r'.ay, this reflects 
^the attitude and accomplish- 
ments of this Administration. 
I am here by nov.' serving my 
resif^nation as Ombudsman. 

It is my hope that this 
resignation will be accepted, 
and if accepted v;ill be retro- 
active to 18 Oct. 1971 

— Sincerely yours, 
David Zehner 



Spanish Tahle correction 

!Dear Editor: 

I would like to correct a 
slight error which appeared 
in the Oct. 15 issue. The 
Spanish Table meets in the 
cafeteria every day (except 
Tuesday) from 11:50 — not 
"every Thursday from 11:50 
to 1:50" as printed.

'MHT" 





i^enator Kris Beermaji asks students in the cafeteria to sipn a 
petition urging incediate action on the Student Bill of Rights 
and Responsibilities. 

Bill of Righta highlighted 

From the President's desk 

by Mark Franl:e , 
Student Eody Iresident 

To date, much has been said about the Bill of Student Eights 
;ind Responsibilities, its present status, its chances of being 
im])leiriented, etc. 

ilov/ever, bccauL-e the .bill ha;; been an issue for better thj-n 
three years, there has been relauively little said of late a- 
bcut its content. Therefore, many freshmen and sophomores are 
unfnmiliar with the actual document. 

To aid this situation, the rerainder of this column will be

At Saturday breakfast 



N.Y. Mayor lohn Lindsay speaks in Fort Wayne 







^ 



John Lindaay 

At a press conference and 
public breakfast Mayor John 
Xiindsay of Nev; York implied 
that he is clearly interested, 
in the cities of America £ind 
their problems in relation to 
the rest of the nation, 

"I'm enormously proud of 
my city of New York," he ad- 
mitted as he began his speech 
before a crowd of over 1,000. 
Acknowledging the fact that 
Hew York has many problems, 
he cited examples of some of 
the progressive moves his 
city has taken under his ten- 
ure in office. 

Accomplishments covered 
such items as city admini- 
stration, public housing, 
such items as city admini- 
stration, public housing, 
police administration, and 
unemployment reduction. The 
mayor pointed out that New 
York has the lowest rate of 
unemployment of any major 



city in the country. And be- 
cause of vast summer pro- 
grajns, has (rone through "six 
long, hot summers of urban 
peace. " 

Through his work, the may- 
or has expanded his personal 
awareness and involvement 
with his city several times 
over, 

"My job has taught me a 
lesson — that city hall 
doesn't decide the life and 
death of a city. The heav- 
iest responsibilities are 
where the most power lies," 
"Power belongs to the men 
in Uashinton who have the 
power to make policy for the 
nation and to set priorities 
for the nation." 

"By the actions of the 
current administration in 
Washington, it is very clear 
that the present policy is 
one of 'the cities be damned' 
...Nothing can be more impor- 
tant than to bring new men 
and new prioritj.es to Wash- 
ington next year. " 

"That's why I became a 
Democrat, the Democratic 
Party offers the best hope of 
change in 1972. Political 
action is the name of the 
game. The only alternative 
to political action is street 
action — and I've seen enough 
of that to know that it 
doesn't work. It always ends 
in violence. Political action 
in 1971 is critically impor- 
tant for its own sake and is 
important for what lies a- 
head. If we don't have poli- 
tical action, the future of 
this country is very much in 
doubt." 

Stressing that the cities 
are the problems of American 
society, the mayor emphasized 
Chat "Cities' problems are

everyone's problems. Every 
town and suburb is sharing 
the cities' distress. No 
community is secure unless 
all communities are secure." 

In order to solve the mul- 
tiple dilemmas confronting 
the cities, Mayor Lindsay 
noted, several steps must be 
taken. One would be the re- 
placement of the total de- 
fense budget with an urbein 
budget. 

"W.e have to thinlc hard on 
where we're going. If this 
country wants to bring about 
changes, men can do it." 

Over thirty billion dol- 
lars are currently spent in 
Vietman alone. As Mayor 
Lindsay suggested, this money 
could be of much more bene- 
fit if allocated for urban 
purposes. Ten billion dol- 
lars, for innumerable pro- 
grams designed to renew the 
strength of urban America. 

In the words of t''ayor 
Lindsay, "We must start to 
turn this country around, 
not because its the right 
thing to do, but because it's 
the only thing. "

Orthogon views left Gibson 



Karty 
Martinez 
Throughout; history, nan has been a rebel. Indeed, the ability 
to challenge very natui^e herself has been called the distinctive 
characteristic of the human being. All other animals follow their 
natures and complete their lives according to plan, whereas nan 
has been given the ability to ask, "who am I, where am I going," 
and more importantly, "do I choose to go that way?" 

In an attempt to understand why a person chooses to go in a 
direction that seems to flow against the tide, I recently spent 
some time talking with Jeff Gibson who is under indictment for 
draft resistance. 

In a series of articles, I intend to try and present Gibson's 
views on the subject of conscription. It would be well to keep 
in mind that the views and arguments presented do not necessarily 
reflect my personal views nor thowe of the editors. 

On April 15, 1971 Jeff Gibson participated in an all-day 
£jiti-war, anti-poverty teach-in held here at Regional campus. 
The newspaper account of that event records that Gibson advocated 
a "widespread refusal to register " with the Selective Service. 
The reason for his position is that, in Gibson's words, that 
registration implies participation, and participation implies 
affirmation of the concept of conscription which is a total 
demand for total service. It is an acknowledgment that the state 
is supreme and that the individual exists solely for, and at the 
whim of, government. It is the acceptance of a system by which 
the rights and the life of an individual may be confiscated. 

GilDSon feels that such confiscation of life is unjustifiable 
in a government which protects inanimate property so zealously. 
"This implies,, and the Selective Service conscription affirms," 
said Gibson, "that in this country, property is more highly 
valued than human life." 

When asked about the need for conscription in order to 
provide protection for this country, Gibson stated: "Not once 
in tl-e history of conscription as Americans have known it, 
have the lives of citizens been confiscated simply to defend the 
homes and lives of those same citizens from attack. Every 
conscription has seen the lives of the confiscated citizens 
delivered to an assault somewhere in the world against the 
established authority of another nation state." 

Gibson's actions, as he sees them, are of a patriot 
exercising his rights as a citizen in order to try and make 
the country responsible to the people once again. He seems 
at times like an early patriot in the spirit of Patrick 
Henry, and at times like a contemporary subversive . 

That his message is important to all of us is without 
doubt; Gibson's actions are of national importance, and 
the people he speaks of, to, and/or for, are all the males 
between the ages of 18-55. 

Gibson will be arraigned in General Court on Thursday, 
Oct. 28th. At that time he will commit the remainder of his 
life to living with the consequences of his decisions- 
Opposing views are actively solicited and will be presented. 
^ly only requirement is that the opposing arguments be made 
by someone who is actively involved in the view he advocates. 
After all, if we do not live what we speak, why bother speaking? 




PIT to present 
Beckett's Endgame 

Purdue Indiana Theatre (FIT) 
will present their second pro- 
duction of the season beginning 
Oct. 29. 

"Endgame", written by Samuel 
Beckett, stars Eick Benz as 
Hamm, Julie Bucheit as Clov, 
Steve McAfee as Nagg, and 
Susanne Koormain as Well. 

The play has a philosophi- 
cal emphasis and deals with 
man at his most minimal and 
perhaps most real, 

"Endgame" probably has more 
raw, physical suffering than 
any other of Beckett's plays, 
yet attempts to portray the 
reality of man's interdepence 
in a world without hope. 

Reservations for any per- 
formcuace can be made now by

One of the primary causes 
of campus unrest, he said, is 
the deep concern of the stu- 
dents to initiate change with 
no means to do it. Now stu- 
dents at lU-rU will have a 
chance to do something in the 
public interest.

lU-PU Mastodons 
register 6-5 

by Dave Hill 

In their ninth contest of 
the season and final home 
game Thursday, Oct. 14, the 
Mastodon soccer team was de-. 
feated by Huntington College , 
3-1. 

The lU-PU kickers had pre- 
viously beaten Huntington by 
a score of 3-2 at Huntington. 

On Saturday the Mastodons 
traveled to Angola for their 
only gEime v;ith Tri-State. 
They came away on the short 
end of a 5-0 score. 

Gary Gotsch played his 
first' full game in goal for 
the Mastodons, but received 
no support from the offense. 

The next game was GMesday 
at Manchester. In an earlier 
contest with Manchester the 
Mastodons were beaten 6-2. 

However, they turned the 
tables on Manchester, edging 
them 1-0. The game's only 
goal cajae in the second quar- 
ter frem high-scoring Masto- 
don right wirier Al Pleek. 
Steve Tobias assisted on the 
play. 

The Mastodon's record now 
stands at 6-5. Their next 
game will be tonuBorrow in 
Lima against OSU. 

In their last gasie with 
OSU the TU-ru.team won 5-2. 



at 5:00 and Hoehn-Eoy against 
Cook at 4:00. 

The train and Woolems axe 
both undefeated and this weeks 
game could decide their divi- 
sion leader. 

Last week Ambrose nipped 
the Greasers 7-0, for. their 
third straight shut-out this 
season. 

Woolems squad got it to- 
gether last Sunday with a 51- 
- win over Ualters-Evarts. 
Both ends, Jim Channey and 
Daryl Woolems, nabbed TD pass- 
es. 

The Posse pounded McMahon 
in another of their undisputed 
wins, 50-0. Aschbacher picked 

Eoger tjpice, Bruce Purdue 
Bill Mclnturf and Marty Martinez 
shored up the defensive line 
and W-E couldn't see their way 
through it for a score- 
up a forfeit from the Beavers 
and the Nads won by forfeit 
over Cook. 

Farrell slipped by Eeed- 
Perry 18-16. "Sugar Bear" was 
named hero of the day as he 
made-up the eighth member of 
the squad averting another 
Farrell forfeit. 

Hoehn-Eay picked up a for- 
feit over the phantom John- 
son team. 

The Train is chugging a- 
long as evidenced by their 
14-0 win over Krause. Mike 
Eatheack completed a TD pass 
to Herb Perlich and Perry 
Erstman ran for the two -extra 
points. 

McGehee completed a 70 
yard pass to ^im Hanson for 
the final score. As usual, 
the box-car defense was up to 
the test and squashed a pair 
of Krause scoring attempts 
near the Train's goal line. 
Last Friday we reversed 
the scoring tallies in the 
Krause vs. V/alters-Evarts 
game. Krause won 18-12.

International Hockey Lea- 
gue opened its 27!ii consec- 
utive season. 

The K's certainly were 
not afraid to fire the puck, 
as they outshot the opponents 
in the three games 115-76. 
However, only five of those 
shots penetrated the enemy 
net with an average of one 
goal for every 23 shots. 

The opposition made 12 
of their 76 attempts count, 
for an average of about one 
goal for every 6 shots. 

The opener in Muskegon 
last Friday saw the Mohawks 
cook the Komets 6-2, 

The home opener last Sat- 
urday night was an exciting 
but low scoring: affair, won 
by visiting Flint 2-1. 

Sunday in Toledo the K's 
dropped a 4-2 verdict to 
the Blades who were the 
league patsies last year. 

It is easily shown that 
Fort Wayne is a great hock- 
ey town take a look at last 
Saturday's home attendance — 
n&amp;arly 5^*^00. Then check the 
fan count in Toledo in the 
affair last Sunday with the 
Eomets — igCO. 

The Komets have 10 vet- 
erans and 12 rookies on the 
roster at the present time. 
One of those rookies, prom- 
ising defensemen Gerry Methe, 
broke his ankle in last Sat- 
urday's home opener and will 
be sidelined for two months. 
The K's get back into ac- 
tion next Friday at home with 
tough inter-division rival 
Des Moines. For a buck and 
a half (with activity card) , 
it's a steal.
