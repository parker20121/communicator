become an integral part of the Fort Wayne community l.y serving Ihe tn-cds »l a

I ,ree amounts ul nmnev un living expenses This campus has now expanded to the 
point where many lour year degrees con be completed right here. 

Graduate work lor professional people in Ihe area is another convenient 
feature of this campus Teachers can complete work on a Masters I h-grcc without 
lakiiiglmieolf Irani regular duties Many evening classes are offered for students 
doing graduate work who hold full time jobs.

Handicapped parking 

It is obvious to us all that the start of the 1974-75 school year has brought a new 
set of problems for each of us lo deal with. 

One such problem that has been brought to our attention should not he a 
problem al all. it the persons creating the furor would simply use common sense 

The problem has to do with the use of the parking spaces for handicapped 
e in no way handicapped, except possibly by a 



We are all aware that Ihe "A" lots on campus are over-filled, and persons who 
paid for "A" stickers are finding d difficult to park in an "A" lot. This particular 
problem has arisen due lo (he dramatic i nc tease in the a 
this year following ihe mi per cent drop in the c 



it of "A" stickers sold 
it of those stickers. This situation

In the meantime, we will all suffer together until the new figures arc compiled 
However, the spaces reserved lur handicapped people riiusl not he violated by 
non-handicapped people. These people were given special plat 
special ramps along Ihose spaces, so that we would n " 
persons face in attending classes here. 

The spaces for handicapped persons are well-marked. If you arc one ol Ihose 
violating the rules of this university by parking in one of these spaces, remember 
the old adage, "Forewarned is forearmed " Future violators arc going lo be towed 
away, rather than ticketed, with the cost of Ihe low paid by the violator. 
If the idea of reserved spaces for the handicapped ol fends you. it might be well to 
remember thai Urm'k Able, um last Student Hodv president, was instrumental in 
lowering the parking fees for this campus.
