Women's struggle for equality continues 



by MelLssa Young-Flores 
News Editor 

Seventy-five years ago this month, 
women's nght to vote became formally 
recognized for the first lime in United 
Slates history, 

Noted in lem books as ihc I9lb 
amcndmeni. the official go ahead for 
women to voice their opinions, politi- 
cally was siill not completely available 
to women. A woman's place was still 
considered to be ai home with the chil- 
dren and domestic chores, not at the 
local campaign rally. 

Three quarters of a century later, 
hoy/ever, the role of women has drasti- 
cally changed. Now two income fami- 
lies and single parent families are not i 
uncommon, and most women enter the j 
poll booth without reservation. 

But in these modern times. 
women sidl struggle to define ilicir 
true and coneci role in American 
society. Although, men have 
begun to take a more active role 
in parenting, women still bear 
most of the brunt of childlx'^ 
ing and nurturing 

Yet. most companies still 
do not offer paid malerniiy 
leave or understand the need \ 
for a daycare with hours Lh:] 
match the companies. 

Just Ihis month. The Citadel 
accepted its first woman cadet after two 
years of bniial warfare in a courtroom. 
Within the same week of her full accep- 
tance to the school. Shannon Faulknen 
left The Citadel while hei former class- 
mates cheered. 

Many claim Faulkner is a hero who 
not could stand the constant agony of 
bemg tormcnied for being a woman, and 
others suggest she sei women back by 
fighting for something she could not do. 

"The passage of the 19th amendment 



was definitely a critical step m the 
achievement of political equality for 
women in this country. Bui jusi as with 
the enfranchisement of blacks in the 
Civil Rights Movement, it has noi 
resulted in economic or 



Nicki Caldwell-Teixcira, secretary 
and student, believes one woman's 
actions can hurt ihe entire move- 
ment. "Women 




Hnvinmnienlal Affairs 
said "Women ate slili 
underrcpresebted in mai i 
social instilullons incliikt ^ 
govenunent, acadeiii,i. J 
the corporale sector, a id 
there is still a culture of discnminauon 
against women and minorities which 
requires that they be exceptional lo be 
excepted. And that is why women like 
Shannon Faulkner who may only be 
average are seen as a failure." 



"Shannon 

|-aulkner tried something 
^h^; Liiuid not do. She was 
iryiiig to advance women's 
rights, but she affected it 
negatively. " 

According to Frank 

Borclli. vice chancellor of 

student affairs. Ihe 

's movement is nol a 

smooth journey for women, 

"Like all movements it happens in 

flows, it moves with Ihe leaders," said 

BoreUi. 

Borrelli also believes not all women 
are fighting for the same issues. "There 
are women on all sides. Women do not 



speak as one vole," he said, 

Kim Jacobs, dirccior of student activ- 
ities, believes many of the inequalities 
American women face could be mini- 
mized by women exercising their rights 
"1 think we hurt ourselves when we 
don't vole." Jacobs said. "We have thai 
pnvilege, we should use it." 

Hillary Rodham Clinton also made 
the front page this month after deciding 
lo attend Ihe United Nations Symposium 
for Women in Beijing, China. Many 
conservative national leaders claim the 
first lady is contributing to the break- 
down of the American family 
However, a Fort Wayne Republican 
Parly representative said, "We have 
made no comment except that she is 
there, and we wish her well." 
Despite the strides women have 
made in the business and political 
world, many still choose and are 
: quite content to work al home, 
often with a disapproving eye 
of other women, Jacobs said 
ihc believes, however the 
choice should be left up to each 
individual. 

"Sometimes we devalue 
women who stay in the home, but we 
have to realize they are developing 
future leaders whedier male or female. It 
IS a personal choice each individual has 
lo make. We have to strike a balance," 
said Jacobs, 

Regardless of which side of the 
Ruble Cube people may lie on, Borclli 
believes the women's movemcnl should 
become more frequently evaluated and 
discussed. 

"The women's movement is some- 
thing we should look at more often, not 
Just at an anniversary, said Borelli. 

"There are some many pressing 
issues in the world. Where does the 
women's movement fit in?"

Decrease in enrollment 
affects expenditures 



by Jennifer Zartman 
Chief Reporter 

College erroilmeni rates around 
the stale are down with a significant 
decrease in university incomes. 
including IPFW. 

'Each year guesses ate made on 
enralbneni rates m order to prepare 
a budget for the year ahead," said 
Wall Branson. vice chancellor of 
financial affairs for IPFW. 
"BudgeLs need lo be realistic and as 
we look ahead, we try lo determine 
the budget level by looking at our 
enrolhneni," he said. 

Last year. IPFW estimated the 
enrollmenl for this year lo be 
decreased by one percent. However 



this year's cruolUnent is down a 4 4 
percent from last year, 
according lo 
Branson 




get Ls made 
up of state appro- 
priations and student 
fees," said Branson 

"There are actually two different 
budgets One is income and the 
other is expense," Branson said. 



"The goal is to balance Ihe two, 

This fall we had a decrease In 
the student fee portion of Ihe bud- 
get, so our income is not as high," 
said Branson. 

Due to IPFW's decrease in 
income, Branson said Ihe college 
will need to make cuts in expendi- 
tures this year "We will need to go 
in and look for cuis in order lo off- 
set Ihe decrease in revenue from 
siudeni fees," he said. 

Branson said it is still loo soon 
to say what the decrease in enroll- 
ment means in the long run. but a 
consistent drop in enrolUncnt could 
mean trouble.

Purdue approves science building 



by Jennifer Zartnun 
Chief Reporter 

In the fall of 1998, the ribbon will be cut on the new 
science building at IPFW 

The new science building will combine modern 
advantages with the charm of Ihe buildings Ihal already 
exist, according to Walt Branson, vice chancellor of 
financial a^airs 

The authorization for Ihe new science buildmg was 
given by the state legislaiure last spring," said Branson. 
"Now we have lo take the project back ttirough Ihe bud- 
get commiiiee for the go-ahead to proceed." he said. 

IPFW ongmally asked the state for S22 7 million for 
the project, but only S18 miUion was approved. "The 
approval actually gives us the authority for bonding and 
gives money for debt coverage." said Branson. 

"T'm not really sure why we didn't get the eniu-e 
amounC' Branson said. "Il could have had somediing lo 
do wid) the fact that there has been a concern by many 
legislators about Ihe amount of consiniciion across the 



"Il could have also had something to do with the dol- 
lar amount or the wordmg," Branson said. "We're jusi 
happy with the S18 million. " 

Branson said IPFW was nol the only campus affect- 
ed by reductions in amounts of allocated money 

"Our local legislators worked very hard to get the 
authorization for the new buddmg and I give them a lot 
of credit," he said. 

The bill which passed ihe legislature did not give 
IPFW the authority to begin construction until July 1. 
1996, IPFW would like lo begin ccmsiruciion sooner, so 
Purdue University, as a system, will go back and ask for 
Ihe other S4.7 milUon and also see about the possibihty 
of breaking ground in March, said Branson. 

"Even it we do begin construction in March, it will 
still be at least two years before the building would be 
open for students. " Branson said 

"We arc really excited about the building, though, 
and we are proceeding with the planaing." Branson 
added. 



Plans for the budding, which will be located on the 
west end of the parking lot between the Kettler and 
Classroom Medical buildings, include a central plaza 
and a parking garage near Gates Sports Center. Tlie new 
building will offer 55,000 square feel of usable space, 
said Branson 

Branson said that the parking garage will be paid for 
out of die self-sufficient parking fee program, but tbe 
plaza is just in the milial planning stages. 

Geo-science, biology and chemislry courses will 
move out of KetUer Hall into die new building, leaving 
plenty of space for other programs. "The Ketder space 
will then be renovated and modemi?ed. which is a dou- 
ble impact of the science building project," said 
Branson. 

The science building, which has not yet been named, 
will be a great contnbution to the growth of the campui. 
"I view die campus as being a major asset to Northeast 
Indiana and the value is increased with diis new addi- 
tion." said Branson.

Healthy Cities offers free 
health screening 



bjr Rebecca Ko«tilg 
Staff Writer 

Skyrocketing costs make health 
insurance a luxury many people 
simply cannot afford. The local 
chapters of the Nursing Students 
Association are teaming up with 
area doctors, demists, registered 
nurses and associations lo bring 
medical care to uninsured or 
underinsured people who need 
medical assistance. 

Healthy Cities is entering its 
fifth year, and 300 to 500 people 
are expected to attend. Patients 
must be at least IS years of age 
The health fair is especially popu- 
lar because it is geared to shelters 
and group homes which are locat- 
ed near both sites 

Booths will be set up at the fair 
sites, Patienu will be able to visit 
any or all of the booths they are 
ihietested in. The fair will be set 
up to do a variety of tests and 
screenings. Among these are 
blood pressure tests, depression 
screening, syphilis screening, HIV 
tests. TB tests, blood tests, sickle 
cell anemia tests and glaucoma 
screening. Also available will be 
flu shots, pneumonia vaccinations, 
TB booster shots, a podiairisi and 
a dentist. If more serious health 
problems are discovered, patients 
will be referred to a clinic. The 



fair will be working closely with 


IPFW siudenis, facility.

"The single most significant 
drop in enrollment could be as a 
result of a strong economy," 
Branson said. "The number of jobs 
available is incredible and the 
number of hours available is amaz- 
ing also." 

"The enrollment raies go in 
cycles," Branson said. "The theory 
may be that a poor economy would 
mean a higher enrollment, but that 
really hasn't been proven yet" 

As a pan of the whole picture. 



the decrease this year is not

in enrollments over the ye; 
according to Branson. 

"We will have to be careful of

"We will probably change the 
budget for next year, and we'll 
look for ways to make programs 
financially work," Branson said. 
"We'll have lo make changes, but

Thanks, but no thanks

soup of people.

would t&gt;e a different issue. Every

are talking about gays — ten percent 
of the population — this story has 
gone unnoticed.

When asked where 1 go to 
school, I always answer "Indiana 
University " I realize that this is a 
bit of a lie. According to the corre- 
spondence that the school sends me 
(if dieir letterhead can be trusted), 1 
actually attend "Indiana University 
Purdue University Fon Wayne." 
But that, to me, seems like quite a 
mouthful. 

I suppose, for brevity's sake. I 
could say "I go 
to IPFW." But 
since most of 
my friends and 
relatives live in 
Boston. This 
would be use- 
less: "IPFW" 
has no meaning 
to them. Such a 
response would 
only inspire 
them to create 
their own solu- 
tions to the 

IPFW acronym. 

and — knowing them — they would 
t&gt;e particularly thrilled with the pos- 
sibilities presented by the "F" I'm 
certain the first word they'd think 
of would Dot be "Fort" 

1 suppose 1 could have some fun 
with this. When asked where 1 go to 
school. I could respond: "I attend 
Indiana University Purdue Fort 
Wayne I have a double major in 
botany and philosophy I want to 
study plants as an idea " Or. I could 
say: "I go to Indiana University, but 
my evil twin attends Purdue 
University " Alternately. I could 
answer: "I go to Indiana University 
Purdue University Fort Wayne." so 
I guess I'm stuck living a he. 

Nevertheless, we Fort Wayne 
students should feel comparatively 
lucky: the Indianapolis campus — or 
Indiana University Purdue 
University Indianapolis, if you 
will — is often referred to as 
"lUPUI." This, I'm sorry to report. 
IS pronounced "eeuie pooie." When 
I hear thLS phrase, higher education 
i.s the furthest thing from my mind 
In fact, "eeuie pooic" sounds much 
more like one of the following: 

I A toddler's euphemism for 
feces 

2. A French phrase, meaning 



"goat's milk" 

3. A companion piece to old 
songs like "Woolly Bully" and 
"Louie, Louie" 

This makes me wonder why the 
"IPFW" adherents don't call our 
school "ip foo": it's concise, and it 
certainly doesn't sound any worse 
dian "eeuie pooie " 

But before we start feeling supe- 
rior about this, we must remember 
that IPFW has its share of name- 
related silliness. Take our mascot, 
the Mastodon: maybe I'm a pes- 
simist, but when I think of 
Mastodons I immediately think 
"extincuon." and this isn't exactly 
the message that you want your 
mascot to convey. (I must note thai 
this is only the second most bizarre 
school nickname of my academic 
career. I attended Bishop Fenwick 
High School in Peabody, 
Massachusetts, and our nickname 
was "The Crusaders." I always 
thought the mascot should've 
livened up the half-time show by 
going into the stands and convert- 
ing heathens, but unfortunately he 
just rode around on a horse and 
looked Catholic.) It seems almost 
unfair dial in a world inhabited by 
Razorbacks, Gators, and the like. 
IPF'W students are represented by a 
slow-moving herbivore whose 
bones are displayed on campus as a 
testament to its durabihty 

This problem is complicated by 
the volleyball team's nickname. 
'The Volleydons" — whatever that's 
supposed to mean (If you ask me it 
sounds like a video game where 
one attempts to bat Mafiosi back 
and forth aaoss a net.) If we con- 
tinue to sanction the usage of 
"Volleydons," can "Hockeydons" 
or "Basketdons" be far behind^ I 
hope so. I've already of enough 
explaimng to do. 

I suggest that we eradicate these 
problems by choosing a new nick- 
name. I think it should be some- 
thing noble: something that 
bespeaks the pride and achievement 
of our student body Something that 
truly represents our place in the 
world of academia. something like 
The Indiana University Purdue 
University Fort Wayne "Ip Foos."

'Dangerous Minds' reveals power of teachers 



by Janet Tobey 
Fcalurm Editor 

1 am a US Mannc. Does any- 
one know any kaxaie? 

This is not what you would 
expect a higb school English 
Icactacr lo wnie on the blackboard. 

In the new feature film, 
"Dangerous Minds." Louanne 
Johnson, the new teacher of "spe- 
cial kids," figures out Lhal she is 
faced with a choice: "Gel their 
aneniion, or qui). " 

Michelle Pfciffer slar^ as the en- 
marine hired on the spot to leach 
this class, the Academy Program. 
The kids arc described lo her as 
"passionate, energetic. challeng- 
ing." 

They are in fact kids who, as 
Coolio puts ii, "been spending most 
their lives living in a gangster's par- 
adise." 

Her first day on the job. she 
finds Uie disorderly class unwilling 
10 Lsten lo her Students are yelling, 
throwing things, aitd listening to rap 



music (Jne of her students. Emilio 
Ramu^7, declares. "I'll cat you " 

Johnson wants lo leach, so she 
plans ways lo get the students' 
involvement. She leaches karate to 
get their ailcniion. A trip to an 
amusement park works as an incen- 
tive She uses the sentence "Never 
shooi a homeboy" in leaching pans 
of speech. 

The lesson she most needs to gel 
across lo her students, however, b 
lhal each one has a choice in bow 
he or she will live The students, 
who come from poor and violent 
neighborhoods, feel Ihcy have no 
future, no voice, no choice to make 
thai could matter Johnson woiks to 
turn this around 

"There are no victims in this 
classroom." declares Johnson, 

She sians every student with an 
'A' for the class, and a clean slate. 
telling them that ii is up to them to 
keep it This is the fusi time most 
of them have bad an 'A' in any- 
thing It peaks their curiosities. 

Johnson's gimmicks get our 



alieniion. but the relationships she 
is then able to develop with her stu- 
dents bnng us in closer the rela- 
tionships give the film depth The 
story goes beyond a teacher who 
beats the odds by getting "rejects 
from hell" to read poetry. We sian 
to care about whai happens lo the 
kids outside of class a5 well 

Raul Sancbcro, a quici Mexican 
boy. gets involved in a fight at 
school. When Johnson goes to his 
house lo talk to his parents, Raul 
expects lo hear complaints about 
his behavior When his teacher 
instead talks of how biigfal he is, 
Raul's face shows the happiness he 
feels He obviously hasn't heard 
himself being praised for a while 

"Dangerous Minds" is about the 
freedom that realizing one is not a 
victim can bring, It demonstrates 
that reaching high and wildly 
exceeding others' expectations is 
the most joyously rebellious thing 
one can do 

Most of all, Ibe film is about the 
incredible effect we can have on 



others" lives, especially if wc are in 
the position of teacher 

"The mind is like a muscle If 
you want it to be really powerful, 
you've got to work it out," Johnson 
lells her class. Usmg language that 
these kids understand, she over- 
comes their objections, breaks 
down the barrier, 

"Each new fact gives you anoth- 
er choice Each new idea builds 
another muscle. And it's Ihose mus- 
cles tbat are going lo make you 
really strong Those are your 
weapons" 

These unlikely students of poet- 
ry, hearing her words, give it a shot, 

"Dangerous Minds" makes you 
want lo go out and be a mentor to 
all of those kids who need someone 
Lke Johnson li makes you believe 
again that maybe we can actually 
mm this crazy world around, if we. 
with a little creativity, Tind ways to

Places to go, people to see: A list of area fun 



by Nol Beckley 
Editor 

Contrary lo conventional wis- 
dom, Foci Wayne and the surround- 
ing area offer some interesting 
activities which are nol located in a 
bar. During an exhausting search 
over miles of cornfields and thou- 
sands of stoplights we. the brain- 
inist of The Communicator, have 
discovered several places where 
being a barfly or a mall nerd does 
not nulier. 

We wanted lo concentrate on 
Fort Wayne, but unfortunately we 
could not completely confine our 
search lo the Fort Hopefully, these 
establishments will benefit from 
your patronage. And once again this 
survey is not scientific nor are these 
in any order, 

•James Dean's Grave-Locaied in 
Fainnounl. which is a short 45 min- 
utes south of Fort Wayne This 
activity is FREE Tours of E&gt;ean's 
house are given regularly. Many 
people have made the pilgrimage to 
this legendary mecca, Il's about 
time you did. 

•Breakfast at The Munchic 
Emporium on Sunday-Their wide 
vahely of omelets are to die for 
The atmosphere of The Muncbie 
Emponum is unique to Fori Wayrje. 
All ages are welcome on Sunday 
morning. A few people bring iheu' 
children in to eat with them 
■Waicb an art film at the Cinema 
Cenler-The films they show are 
some of the best independent films

made The center brings an air .of 
culture to the depraved streets of 
Fod Wayne 

•I'he Fori Wayne Museum of Art- 
Like Dean's grave, this activity is 
free, but donations are 
accepted. (usually a dollar or two) 
Considering the wealth of ariislic 
quality the Museum exhibits a small 
donation is a paltry sum for the 
amount of enlightenment received. 
•Attend IPFW's own PIT produc- 
tions-Many of the plays feature 
some of the university's and Fort 
Wayne's finest talent Directing 
these productions are the best direc- 
tors in Fon Wayne This fall. PIT is 
producing "The Glass Menagene," 
"The Fan tas licks" and "An Evening 
of Fractured Shakespeare" among 
others, 

•Gel loaded at the wineries in 
Michigan- You do have to be 21 for 
this activity, sorry kids Being a 
wine connoisseur is not a require- 
ment though, sometimes it helps m 
staying sober. A tolerance lo wine 
also diminishes the pain of the 



hangover. The wineries are located 
on 169. just over ihe border. 
•Go lo a Wizards, Komets or Fury 
maich-The Wizards are m die play- 
offs this year and Ihe Komeis con- 
tinually contend for the Turner Cup 
The Fury, on the oUier hand, is not 
up to thai level yet. lU standout 
Damon Bailey has recently signed 
with the Fury This is an added 
attraction along with trying lo fig- 
ure out which kids in the stands 
were fathered by Jay Edwards 
'Attend poetry nighl or live band 
night ai the Dash-In Cafe on 
Calhoun Ave Tlie Dash-In is prob- 
ably the quamiest place m the ciiy. 
The cafe offers a wide variety of 
coffees, cappuccinos and import 
beers. The pauonagc is very infor- 1 
mai and easily accessible Entenng 
any conversation is welcomed. 
•The Library-Not the Helmke 
library, but the main Fort Wayne 
library. Yes being at the library can 
be a geeky way to spend your time, 
bul your mind can only expand by 
being there. The library carries 



major newspapers from the larger 
markets which are located on the 
main floor. Their genealogy depan- 
ment is one of the best in the coun- 
try The best tiling the library offers 
is a fonim lo study die loonies who 
frequent the library 

Hopefully at least one of these 
ten places appeals to you. Wc tried 
lo include different activities for 
different personalities But one 
which we left out because it ls com- 
pletely geared for the "of age" 
crowd-River City Sand volleyball, 
billiards, dans and euchre louraa- 
menis are frequently offered.

The music was booming 

■ outside Williams Theatre 
ISunday afternoon when 
iThcater Chair Larry Life 
I announced lhal they were 
Igoing to start the give- 
laways. 

Some people won tee 
I shins from local radio sia- 
llions. Dairy Queen 
I coupons and other goodies. 

The Interim Dean of the 
ISchool of Fine and 
I Performing Arts. David 
iMcCants. came over to 
lenjoy the celebration. He 

■ said be was pleased to see 
I the big turnout and was 

1 to meet some of the 
I freshman students. 

"The Fine and 
IPcrforming Arts disci- 
Iplines have been here since 
1 the beginning of the school 
I in the 60's I think that the 
I fact that they've been here 
I since the beginning shows 
la commitment to academic 
I excellence in those areas," 
\ McCants said. 

"The addition of new 
I facilities has meant acade- 
Imic opportunities to slu- 
Idenls are even greater." 
I McCants added. 

Director Larry L. Life 
I said he thinks this theater 



season should be an o 
ing one. 

"Tent Meeting." direct- 
ed by Amy Paliganoff, is 
the first show done in 
Studio, followed by "Glass I 
Menagerie," directed by | 
Larry Life, in Willian

show is in Studio again I 
with Greg Steiber directing I 
"A Piece of My Heai 
then back to Williams' I 
Theater for "Flea in Her I 
Ear," directed by Marcia| 
Hepps, 

The four shows for Ihe I 
fall arc set; the cast list I 
came out on Monday but I 
the theater could still use I 
people to help out with I 
costumes, sets, and back- 
stage work. You can con- | 
tact the theater office 
219-481-6551. 

Auditions for il

ater a call and maybe they I

TV talk shows: The good, the bad, and Jerry Springer 



by Jaml Tohey 
Fiaturcs Editor 

If visitors from another pUnet 
cJccicled to watch 'IV lo learn about 
humans, what would they Hunk of 
us? 

If Ihey happened lo lune-in lo 
popular talk shows such as "Bickl 
Lake" and "Jenny Jones," ihey 
would probably decide Ihai we 
weren't worth contacting. 

Talk shows aie noi inhcrcnily 
bad, bul it seems the intelligence 
levels of most of them are sinking 
very low 

Many people dismiss talk shows 
aliogcthcr as consolidated garbage. 
But the prognum have the opportu- 
nity to be a forum for slimulaling 
conversation, and even uplifting 
ideas. A few of ihe popular shows 
succeed to some degree in aiming 
for ihe brain Most however, fall far 
shofi. and hit the grnin. 



The producers of "Ricki Lake" 
seem bent upon showmg us, five 
days a week, our species at its 
worst The protoplasmically chal- 
lenged guesLs cannot make a gram- 
matically correct statement, 
but (bey can make fiv 
babies with as many dif- 
ferent parmers. 

Barnyard animals 

Sally Jesse Raphael 
usually has topics such 
■How to Deal With 
Problem Kids." or, "Why Do My 
Kids Dress Like Slobs?" She will 
cry with you but never solve any of 
your problems. 

Would somebody tell me how 
Jenny Jones was given a talk show? 
I'm sure she is as nice as anybody, 
but her voice gets higher and highei 
with every word until the dogs 
whimper. Her topics are mostly 
about sex She reminds me of 
"Love Connection's" Chuck 




Woolery. always asking, "And then 
what h^qipcned? Did you kiss him? 
Did you tike it?" 

MariLou Henner's new show is 
a hodgepodge of exciting news 
fla.shes such as. "fall eye shadow 
looks" followed by "real-life 
lovers of soap opera stars." 
Just about everything you 
never wanted to know. 
Then there is Geraldo, who 
perfected the art of acting like 
he cared when his guests sobbed 
about being swindled and dumped 
on the episode: "When Cupid's a 
Crook ■ 

Channel surfing displays a 
plethora of the talk show genre, 
which makes one assume that this is 
what the public wants. 

Maybe people like to watch 
other people on TV whose lives are 
more messed-up than their own 
Tbe topics catch our allcnlion, and 
besides, maybe the national confes- 



sional will provide some answers 
for the poor souls 

Too bad the guests usually leave 
the show, having poured out their 
deepest secrets, with no real solu- 
tions Tbe producers seem lo want 
to keep the problems fresh and 
unresolved for another roll in the 
muck next month 

Still, we keep watching Perhaps 
for some of us, this is because occa- 
sionally we do find something of 
value from talk shows. We learn 
how to avoid scam artists, what to 
do legally if harassed, why you 
should kick 'em to the curb. 

Oprah Winfrey's show is often 
worthwhile She focuses on how to 
improve the world, raise youi kids, 
and value yourself Her show has 
had a bad reputation for being a 
male-bashing show, probably 
because when her show began, 
women who had really terrible rela- 
tionships first learned lo kick 'em to 



the curb 

Jerry Springer's show is a late- 
night goodie He docs tend to have 
quite a few gender-bend- 
ing shockers such as. "I 
just found out my 
boyfriend is really a girl." 
but Jerry shines bnghtcsi 
when called upon to ver- 
bally tackle a bigot His 
"Final Thoughts" could be 
compiled into a book 
called. "How We Can 
All Get Along " 

And of course, Donahue is good 
with morning coffee. If you have 
slept through Good Morning 
America, you can sdll usually get 
breakfast for your head with Phil. 
though it may be lukewarm from 
time to time. 

Zap that remote with savvy and 
you may find intelligent life forms, 
even on talk shows Recently on 
Donahue, gifted children spoke 



about iheir goals in 
life; the parents 
shared advice on how 
satisfy the curiosity of 
young geniuses 
without pushing 
them Listening 
to likable people 
who arc not pitied 
was refreshing 
So, arc the sensa- 
(ionali7.ed talk 
shows featuring 
low-life forms a repre- 
sentation of what people 
want? The reaching for more and 
more extreme forms of human 
behavior may be a reaction lo satu- 
ration, an attempt to keep up the 
ratings when we have by now seen 
it all. 

But the producers arc underesti- 
mating American viewers if ibey 
continue producing shows in ibis 
vein Or. at least I hope so.

NCAA football preview: 

Championship race wide open 



by Jim Porter 
Sports Editor 

The prognosticatoT has returned 
and Ibis week he looks in(o his 
crystal ball to preview the NCAA 
and the Top 20 fooiball teams from 
(he collegiate level 

This season, much like last, (he 
early favori(e is Bobby Bowden's 
squad at Florida State The 
Seminolcs have finished in the top 
five in (be past eight seasons, an 
NCAA record. This season promis- 
es to be no differenL FSU plays five 
of iLs first seven games of the sea- 
son at home and they have not lost 
to an Atlantic Coast Conference 
(ACC) opponent since joining the 
union. Though the defense lost a 
number of impact players, the 
Seminoles are still blessed with the 
game-breaking skills of Warrick 
Dunn, who may contend for (be 
Heisman trophy at season's end and 
the talents of Orpheus Roye. Look 
for Rorida State to contend for the 
national title if they can get past 
intrastate rivals, Miami and Florida 
as well as ACC opponents Duke 
and Virginia 

In Ihe Big Ten, the undeniable 
favorite has to be Penn Stale, Sure, 
the Nitlany Lions will miss the likes 
of Ki-Jana Carter and Kerry Colhns 
who both moved on to the NFL. but 
Head coach Joe Paterno always 
seems to be able to reload in a time 
of need. K is doubtful whether PSU 
will be able to average 48 points per 
con(est as they did last season. They 
will be able to tally enough points 
to get back to the Rose Bowl and 
possibly play Southern Cal for ihe 
national championship 

At Auburn, the Tigers are com- 
ing off of probation and have one 
of the easiest schedules in the land. 
It is doubtful whether any 
team in the conference will give 
If a L 

hassle this season until the confer- 
ence championship when they are 
likely to face Florida, The Tigers' 
schedule almost hands them nine 
wins with only two difficult games, 
one against Florida and the other 
against Alabama both at home The 
defense lacks experience and will

Southern Cal There is a lot of ath- 
leticism on (he Trojan squad and i( 
all slarts with wide receiver 
Keyshawn Johnson. Johnson ended 
'94 with eigh( 100 yard games and 
looks to be pruned to con(inue that 
trend this year USC is loaded with 
talent on both sides of the ball and 
could possibly be undefeated 
before they travel to South Bend to 
face the Irish on October 21 It could 
be one of the most meaningful 



face Colorado, After that, only 
Oklahoma stands in (he way of 
Nebraska and another undefea(cd 
season So (here you have it. a 
sketch of (he teams who promise (o 
be major contenders for this year's 
mythical national championship. 

Yet another argument for a post- 
season playoff may surface (his 
year. Some talented teams have 
been omiited. (here will cerumly be 
a few upsets and surprises this year, 
that's what makes college football 
so exciting However, as is (be case 
mos( every season ihe cas( of char- 
ac(ers won't waver much at sea- 
son's end when number one is one 
ihc line. Sit back and enjoy (be ride, 
ihcrc are 1 1 weeks before the end of 
this years campaign and 18 weeks 
before New Year's Day and Ibe 
decision of who is number one. 

By the way. for those of you 
who are betting folk, Nonhwcstcm 
has been tabbed a million to one 
sho( to win Ihe Big Ten ihis year- 
It's highly unlikely the Wildcats 
will fmish much higher Ihanl lib in 
the conference. Don't (ell me you 

Eighl conference, the Comhuskers haven't ever tried your luck wilh 

will have little competition until the the lottery either!
