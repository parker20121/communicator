IPFW hosti 
the Harrison Square Project with 
Mayor Graham Richard, Deputy 
Mayor Mark Becker and associ- 
ates of Hardball Capital. 

The meeting was sponsored by 
IPFW College Republicans, the 
American Democracy Project ajid

The discussion opened as Chan- 
cellor Michael Wartell welcomed 
the audience and mentioned that 
a university was the appropriate 
place for debate and discussion. 

Mayor Graham Richard began 
with an overview of downtow 11 reno- 
vation within the recent past, includ- 
ing the Allen County Public Library, 
the Grand Wayne Center and the Fort

was purchased by Hardball Capital,

Wikipedia 
credibility 
under fire 



By Zach Hunsinger 

Wikipedia, the popular "self- 
balancing" website often comes 
under fire because of credibility 




not n 



,this 




louder--an influential editor faked 
his credentials by claiming to have 
a Ph.D. when he did not, a practice 
that is shunned by academia. 

In light of this mishap and subse- 
quent intense debate, the question 
t be posed: Where does Wiki- 
pedia stand in the academic field? 

Is Wikipedia a credible website 
to cite for research? Lynette Fel- 
ber, an English and Linguistics 
professor and Clio editor-in-chief, 
says "no, not to cite." In fact, it is 
difficult to find any faculty in the 
academic field that feels Wikipe- 
dia is acceptable for research- 
One university banned the web- 
site from student use. 

However, students still found a 
way around the firewalls and con- 
tinued using the website. 

Generally, Wikipedia informa- 
tion can be confirmed in a second, 
more credible, source. If students 
can find no other source, and feel 
the information must be in their 
paper, students must cite the web- 
site in their projects. 

James Toole, assistant professor 
of political science, says, "Always 
cite the sources of your informa- 
tion. Using Wikipedia will weak- 
en your paper, but at the least your 
honesty will be respected." 

He further explains that citing 
encyclopedias for research papers

Becker also staled that it the entire 
Harrison Square project were solely 
about baseball, the city would have 
left it as it is now. He said that the 
project is about more than baseball 
"(It \ I about economic development." 
Cost I l &gt;r the tirst stage ol tins project 
is expected to be SI25 million. 

Representatives from Hardball 
Capital and Barry Real Estate (a part- 
ner company to Hardball) discussed 



their hopes for the development ol 
the downtown area and the Harrison 
Square project. 

Hardball chairman Chris Schocn 
is also CEO of "(a) national firm that 
specialize- in urban real estate devel- 
opment," according to the Upstate In- 
diana Business Journal. Jason Freier 
is the CEO of Hardball Capital. 

Schocn described the urban scene 
as chancing from the "Leave it to 
Beaver" lifestyle, where the major- 
ity ol people live in the suburbs, to 
the more modern '.'Friends'' or "Sein-

Freier stressed that the key to Har-

from the simultaneous opening of re-

Women's History Month 
educates, inspires both sexes 



By Zach Hunsinger 

March is Women's 
History Month. The Na- 
tional Women's History 
Project (NWHP), created 
in 1980, petitioned Con- 
gress to create a nation- 
ally recognized women's 
history month. In 1981, 
Congress declared March 
as a month to remember 
women and their achievc-

in the 1840s. the second 
wave started in the 1960s and the 
third wave started in the 1990s. Prior 
to the second wave of the women's 
movement, textbooks often omitted 
or left incomplete women's accom- 
plishments throughout history. 

Advocates of Women's History 
Month hope to educate us while cel- 
ebrating women's achievements. A 
major goal is to bring attention to the 
issues that many women deal with. 
These issues consequently affect ev-

The term women's studies is actu- 
ally misleading. lU-hllooinirigton 
tilled their women's studies program 
equivalent as gender studies. Again. 
this title fails to fully encompass 
what the courses discuss. Women's 
■audic- and gender studies go beyond 
the sex and into diversity. The pro- 
grams involve issues relating to race, 
socio-economic class, sexual orienta- 
tion and gender. 

Many generations of women have 
taken great ■stride lor womankind 
Textbooks now include Harriet Tub- 
man and Eleanor Roosevelt, equality 
issues are still lacking. For example, 
medication is mainly tested on male 
lab rats, yet women and men iv.ponel 
differently to medication. Rates of 
pay are also not equal, with the aver- 
age women earning 79 cents for ev- 
ery dollar a man earns. 

Bom in 1992, the field of women's 
studies is relatively new Before Pur-

due or IU, IPFW offered a bachelor's 
degfec in this field. 

IU-Bloomington followed in 1997 
and Purdue followed in 2002. 

Nationwide, colleges and universi- 
ties offer over 800 women's studies 
bachelor's degree programs and 18 
doctorate programs. 

IPFW's women's studies program 
is not a department, it has no resi- 
dential faculty. The program is a 
collaboration of other departments 
offering courses related to this lield 
of study. 

Fox said "there is no problem of 
retention, unlike other majors." The 
program is relevant to everyone; 
some of us are women, while others 
of us have daughters, wives, sisters 

Fox added that "the media has cre- 
ated a biased view of feminists. We 
are not man-haters; we do not burn 
bras. We arc committed to overcom- 
ing devaluation of women and those

A need for a women's studies 
department on t.impus exists. Tlie

is anchored in women's studies and

March is full of campus 
involving students who stud) 
en's rights, non-traditional students 
and the community at large, The 
women's studies program is hosting 

c students' work'. 
The Center for Women and Return-

Others for mothers who balance work 
with raising children and attending 

"How to Work the System: Single 

Mothers and Community Resources" 
is an event that will explain the many 
resources available lo single mothers 
for assistance. 

The Center for Women and Return- 
ing Adults functions lo help women 
and non-lnidilional students enter 
IPFW and remain at IPFW. Some 
non-traditional students arc intimi- 
dated by the younger students who 
attend college straight from high 
school. 

Robin Newman. CWRA Direc- 
tor and Assistant Dean of Students, 
explains thai many programs are 
already in place to help women and 
non-iraditional students enter and 
continue through their college career 
Workshops are available that teach 
students now lo study, take notes and 
use computers. 

While some non-tradiiional stu- 
dents feel Ihcy lack these skills. New- 
man mentions that "non-traditional 
students have other skills oblained 
(mm having a family or exposure in 
the workplace Unit can transition into 
study and note-taking skills." 

CWRA wotks with the community 
all year by bringing attention to abuse 
and custody battles. Janet Bell will 
present "Topics and Tips in Family

The center directs students to shel- 
ters and other agencies designed lo 
heal economic or menial hardships 
The center also works with the li- 
nuncial aid office to help women

scholarships.

No Spring Break solves laziness 



Pardon the Pun 

By Michelle Yahne 



It's aboui that time again. Wc had 
one good spring day and I saw it with 
my very eyes. I like to call it dwin- par 
dling classroom syndrome... or per- Bre 
haps itVjust-roo-hiec-oulsidc dis- cnti

puts it) as Ihc optional attend: 



loathe me Cancel spring break. Yes. 
you heard me right, cancel Spring 
Break. We don't have a week-long 
break during die tall semester, we 
only gel 2 days off. and the fall se- 
mester goes by SO quickly!! 

I have yet lo reveal die best 

part. If we go .ihe.id .mil -lip Spring

irly, when wc know 



cathcr won t be lesty, 

■■ill also have another 



program. Everyone gels it— teachers, week between finals and the s 



students, even advisors. You know 
what I'm talking about; people take 
days off from responsibilities. The 
had thing is. is that when we get (his 
syndrome too early, it forces us lo 
work harder .it I he end ot the semes 
ter. For some reason, il is very dif- 
ficult for students and faculty lo gel 
back inlo Ihc groove of schoolwork 
the moment Spring Break ends. 
Il seems like il takes us so 
lo get back in the swing of t

However, I would argue that if 
they wailed to publicize a Summer 
Break special, more students would 
appear in it simply because they 
aren't in school. Also, people would 
go on vacation for longer periods of 
time, since classes would be out for 
three entire months.

Arizona green tea energy drink cross examined 



By Said El-Dajani 
Managing Editor 



Further proving that aesthetics 
(rumps practicability is the energy 
drink maiket-a huge, no longer up- 
and-eouiing beverage option dial de- 
fies ihe rules of health. 

I've decided that an analysis of 
an energy drink is necessary, not jusi 
to inform people of the taste and po- 
tential kick, bul bow the drink sur- 
vives amidsi many competitors. 

An energy drink purchase usually 
-.tails when you're in a store during 
an exhausting part of the day. Your 
objective many not be the drink, but 
the eye-catching can is enough for 
you to say, "this can't be loo bad." 
Whether or noi u is. it doesn i matter 



Iznergy drinks already have a reputa- 
tion of tolerable bad flavor. 

Addiction or dedication to a 
brand at this point is irrelevant, so 
I now dedicate my time in allow- 
ing you readers to pick and choose 
from the wide variety you might be 
too alraid too attempt. One can is by 
an already popular brand commonly 
known as "Arizona." 

Everything about this can says 
buy me. The sexy black backdrop ot 
ihe can sends a powerful message to 
the brain. Red. a subordmaic color, 
accentuates ihe can and emphasizes 
the idea of energy. 

Remember, packaging can be 
very persuasive, usually due to exten- 
sive research consisimg of studying 
demographics (hen gearing results 
toward ihe large! market. Since hlack 



is a color lhat connotates power, 
it's more than likely driven toward 
lower-income people. Like dreams, 
targeted products demand our sub- 
conscious to focus on our deepest 
desires. 

In general, the can is well-com- 
posed from a design perspective. 
Its layout has all the qualities of a 
marketable product and credibility 
through brand equity. 

No! only did I buy this green lea 
energy drink because the can looked 
good, I have a previous knowledge of 
a good producl-Arizona. 

With the visual elements in mind, 
let's examine the taste. Beside tear- 
ing the flavor after ihe first gulp, I 
wasn't sure what to think. 

While preserving some of Ihe 
original taste of green tea, the ener- 



gy pan prohahly contributed by the 
1000 mg of laurine. hurt Ihe flavor. 
By far my least favorite drink of all 
lime, Arizona, I believe, failed to 
produce a successful drink. Some 
of the problem is ihe carbonaiion. 
which takes the gassy feeling ot soda 
(or pop) into the herbal department. 

If you still like green lea and be- 
ing awake then this might be a drink 
for you. The flavor is rough, bin what 
energy drink flavor isn't? It has a 
punch to il that wakes you up and 
when it comes down lo it, that's what 
you're looking for. 

Whether or not this drink will 
survive on the shelves is something 1 
unt predict, but it interested, you're 
likely to find them at your nearest 
Walgreens.

Devoted fans make reunion tours worth the effort 



By Aaron Thomas 

At a packed house at the Whis- 
key A Go-Go, Gordon Sumner taka 
Sling I look a drink of water and said. 
"We're gonna come clean.... We're 
actually gonna go on tour." to which 
the crowd roared with excitement. 

The whole world went nuts 

at the idea of The Police go- 
ing on tour. Il was on the front 
page of USA Today, it was on 
the website Punk News, and it 
was met with an unprecedented 
kind of response from the collec- 
tive rock world. It was almost as 
if a reunion tour by a band that 
has built up several generations' 
worth of fans was something 
never done before. 

On Ihe contrary! The Po- 



the underground scene and vvord- 
of-mouth has done to their records. 
This is something wholly different 
to bands like The Rolling Stones and 
Metallic.! who. it seems, just won't 
go away. These are bands that made 
one or .two or five records and then 
disappeared, sometimes into com- 
plete obscurity, but through the vast

Whether you're for or

you could probably thank or 
blame the trend on The Pixies.

can Idol-inspired albums, or some 
oilier random junk with an electronic 
rhythm track and computer-enhanced

is brought on for their looks instead 
of their actual talent. 

There's only one thing this can 
mean: there's a whole arsenal of 
fans-in-hiding who rarely buy new 
albums and do not listen to ihe radio 
or watch MTV, but instead selective- 
ly collect their music one record at a

only lime they create any kind of uni- 
fied voice is when select artists from 
iheir treasured collection perform 
near their hometown, at which time

Underground's "Andy Warhol," one 
of the most influential albums ever 
recorded, has not gone gold ... yet. 

How do I know this? —I am part 
of that arsenal.

Lamb of God tears up Piere's 



8y Hidi Moore and Mike Webb 



Droves of twenty-somethings clad in black 
congregated Thursday night at Piere's, beck- 
oned by Gojira. Machine Head. Trivium and 
Lamb of God's deafening metal lyrics. 

Opening the concert was Gojira, a doom- 
metal band from France. Focusing on mainly 
slow-paced, atmospheric metal, Gojira's origi- 
nality made up for their lack of passion. 

The real show started when the godfathers 
of hardcore metal Machine Head seized the 
stage, working the crowd into a frenzy, starting 
the first mosh pits of the night. 

The contrast in intensity between the two 
opening acts was noticeable; Machine Head in- 
fused the crowd with a pervasive energy that 
never hacked down. 

Trivium played next, and for many they 
were a mixed bag, mostly performing songs off 
of their latest record "The Crusade." However, 



their older songs, which are less influenced by 
Meiallica. received the loudest welcome of 
their set list by far. 

Finally, Lamb of God took the siage. cloaked 
in a haze of green. As the headliners, they had 
the hinge si sei lisi of the nighi, hut no one pres- 
ent complained. 

Rarely does a band sound the same live

Martin. TN - The IPFW baseball 
team is gelling closer to putting it 
all together. The young Mastodons 
dropped a doubleheader today at UT- 
M an in by the scores of 4-1, and 5-2. 

With a roster that features 14 play- 
ers in the freshman and sophomore 
class, IPFW has struggled to find its 
way so far in 2007 and ihe growing 
pams continued today.

UT-Martin got a pair in the sec- 
ond on an RBI double from left field- 
er Blake Turner and a run-seorinj; 
single from second baseman Chad 

The Skyhawks added a single run 
in the 5th inning to take a 4-0 lead. 

IPFW broke through in the top of 
the 6th inning, taking advantage ot 
some sloppy UTM play. After a sin- 
gle from freshman Ryan Beer, sopho- 
more catcher Adam Miller brought 
him home as his grounder to second 
was misplayvd. It would be ihe only 
run for IPFW in Ihe game. 

In the nightcap, ihe 'Dons (2-16) 
jumped oul to a 1 -0 lead in the second 
on an RBI sacrifice fly by sophomore 
left fielder Qucntin Brown, 

IPFW made it 2-0 in the third. Ju-
