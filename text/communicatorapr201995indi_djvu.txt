Campus politician runs for council seat 



By S. Brant Kdley 
Edilor-ln-Chief 
andNolT. Beckley 
News Editor 

IPSGA Director of Communications Jerry 
Richardson threw his hat into the race for 
Warsaw's Second District Cily Council seal 
next November. 

Jerry Richardson is running unopposed in 
the Democratic primary and will face either 
incumbent Republican Gene Brum fie Id or 
Glen Williams in the general elections. 
According to Jerry's campaign manager, 
Cecily Richardson, boih Brumfield and 
Williams are well-known in the Warsaw 
area. She expects the Republican primary lo 
be a tight race. 

Brumfield is serving the remainder of 
Russell Heyde's term on the city council. 
Richardson said Brumfield is experienced 
and well-known by people in the second dis- 
irici. The reasons for Heyde's departure are 
uncertain, according to Richardson. 

"I think [my chances] are good. ..I'm 
going in as an underdog, definitely.'' 
Richardson said. He added he thought his 
ability to make himself familiar lo the people 
of Warsaw's second districi would be a 
determining factor. 

In a press release published on Feb. 6, 
Richardson said he hopes to gain political 
experience in running for and possibly occu- 
pying the second districi seat. 

Richardson said he also hopes to bring a 
"fresh perspective to city politics, emphasiz- 
ing issues such as rcviialization of the com- 
mercial district of the downtown area, 
regaining the 'identity' of the city, and the 
environment." 

Cecily Richardson, who is also Jerry's 
mother, said "The people in Warsaw are anx- 
ious for new ideas and arc interested in 
Jerry's campaign." 

"We are getting a lot of positive feedback 



and people want to see new blood in local 
politics." she added. 

Jerry Richardson said he believes in much 
of what the Libertarian Party stands for. 
"Libertarians are open to social policy that is 
liberal and fiscal policy which is conserva- 
tive and thai fits in very closely with moder- 
ate Democrats," he said. Cecily Richardson 
said running as a Democrat made bctlcr 
political sense lhan on Ihc Libertarian ticket. 
"Jerry's very moderate politically, but he is 
more aligned socially with the Democratic 
Parly," she said. To ihe best of Cecily 
Richardson's knowledge Warsaw does not 
have a Libertarian Party. 

Richardson said he wants to create a 
"technology enterprise zone" lo attract tech- 
nical and bio-tech companies which could be 
productive in the far future. "I would like to 
take a proactive stance instead of a reactive 
stance when ii comes to reviializaiion," Jerry 
said. 

Richardson's other main planks in his 
platform are starting an environmentally 
friendly voluntary curbside recycling pro- 
gram and inhibiting the flow of drugs into 
Warsaw from urban areas. Richardson said 
he believes property crime (burglary or larce- 
ny) is directly related to drug use. 

"If you don't have a drug problem, you 
don' t have a crime problem," he said. 

A registered Democrat, Richardson for- 
mally declared his candidacy on Friday, Feb. 
3. 

Richardson studies political science a( 
IPFW and plans to graduate in May. He 
graduated from Warsaw High School in 
1990. 

Warsaw voiing primaries are on May 2. 
Richardson said he is working on getting 
voters registered and familiarizing himself 
with the local citizens. 

IT elecied, Richardson would receive 
S4,000 per year for his four-year term.

The latest Purduc-indiana 
Theater production is "Romeo and 
Juliet." The famous Shakespeare 
play premiered at the Williams 
Theater last Friday and will con- 
tinue through this weekend. April 
21 and 22 at 8 p.m. 

When first arriving I thought 
this play would be the play of the 
year. I was mistaken. 

The problem with this produc- 
tion was casting, pure and simple. 
The rote of Tybalt was strong and 
well performed. Larry Life gave a 
rather limited, bul strong portrayal 
of Montague. But when it came 
down to what really mattered, for 
instance the roles of Romeo and 
Juliet, one had to question what 
happened.

when Juliet, played by Noclle 
Davis, said the famous line 
"Romeo. O Romeo wherefore an 
ihou, Romeo?" I feel this line 
should come from the depth of her 
soul. Davis just used her 
diaphragm. 

The great highlight about this 
play, however, was the great use of 
set design done by Steven T. 
Sarratore. And the combat choreo- 
grapher Richard Stockton Rand 
and Fight and Dance Captain 
Lynda High really brought ihe 
play alive. 

Director Marcia D. Hcpps did a 
good job of bringing Verona alive 
and directing tliis timeless classic.

"Juliet. O Juliet, wherefore art

This production receives only

From the Editor's desk... 

Picks of the week 



Kara Whiting 
Features Editor 

IIOOK OF THE WEEK: 
"The Stranger" by Albert Camus. 
This short novel is best read in 

French. Bul If you do not know 
French, then 1 still suggest reading 
it anyway because it is easy and 
interesting. 



MOVIE OF THE WEEK: 

"Pulp Fiction" starring John 
Travolta. Although this flick has 
been out for quite some time it is 
still an interesting movie to go and 
see again and again. Because, if you 
are like me, you might need to go 
and see this a couple of times. 
MOVIE TO RENT OF 
THE WEEK: 



"Some Kind of Wonderful" starring 
Eric Slolz. This early eighties flick 
is a great flashback for those of us 
who miss the good 'ol days. 

CDOFTHEWEEK: 
'Tank Girl" soundtrack. This CD is 
an eclectic mix of bands ranging 
from Devo to Ice-T. Listen to it, 
you might find it enjoyable.

XN SEARCH OF... 

BEN ANP JERRYS ICE CREAM 



By Kam Whiling 
Features Editor 

Oh help mc God. This week I 
did the most amazing taste test: 
Den and Jerry's Ice Cream. Lillle 
did I know when I walked into 
that grocery that I would walk out 
with nine pints or this great stuff. 
If you arc into the non-diet thing. 
I suggest you try all of the flavors 
that Den and Jerry offer. You will 
not be sorry, 

Dut alas. I could not do it all, 
because if I did I would not be 
able to fit through a door. So 1 
chose only to lastc the ice cream, 
not the frozen yogcrt or the new 
addition lo the Den and Jerry line, 
Smooth Ice Cream. No, instead I 
lasted all the flavors that have too 
much fat, too many calories and 
arc too rich for my blood. 

The flavors that I chose were as 
follows: New York Super Fudge 
Chunk, Duller Pecan, Chunky 
Monkey, English Toffee Crunch, 
Mint Chocolate Cookie, 
Rainforest Crunch, Cherry 
Garcia. Chocolate Chip Cookie 
Dough and Peanut Butler Cup. 

The rating system for such 
delectable ice cream was very 
difficult 10 come up with. So I 
have decided since all the flavors 
are soooooooo good and rich and 
irrcsliblc, they all are equal!! 
NEW YORK SUPER FUDGE 
CHUNK 

This particular flavor contains 



only the finest ingredients. (What 
did you expect from those guys 
anyway?) For instance, picture 
this: rich, smooth chocolate ice 
cream, with white and dark fudge 
chunks, fudge-coated almonds, 
pecans and walnuts. This is a 
chocolate lover's dream come 
true. But, do not be fooled by 
such awesome lastc: if you con- 
sume even one-half cup of this 
stuff you also take in 290 calories 
and 20 grams of fat. I will say 
this again and again, oh help me 
God. 

BUTTER PECAN 

The ingredients in this one arc 
as rich and plentiful as the New 
York Super Fudge Chunk. Try 
swallowing rich, creamy smooth 
ice cream with HUGE chunks of 
pecans without wanting another 
spoonful. Believe mc, It is diffu- 
cult. And to make it harder, for a 
half of a cup you consume 310 
calories and 26 grams of fat. Oh 
well. I guess 1 will just skip diet- 
ing this week, 

CHUNKY MONKEY 

Ingredients: banana ice cream 
surrounded by fudge chunks and 
walnuts. I am not too sure about 
this flavor. I guess maybe if you 
like bananas, a lot. Again, you 
should not be even remotely 
thinking of dieting when eating 
this stuff because for one serving 
(1/2 cup) you not only get those 
gigantic walnuts but you also get 



280 calories and 19 grams of fat. 
ENGLISH TOFFEE CRUNCH 

This ice cream is fairly simple 
compared to some of the flavors 
that Ben and Jerry offer. Are you 
ready for this? Vanilla Ice Cream 
with chunks of Heath Toffee. God 
help us all!! All 1 can say is 290 
calories and 20 grams of fat later, 
I felt reborn. 

MINT CHOCOLATE 
COOKIE 

I am not that BIG of a mint 
chocolate ice cream fan, but Den 
and Jerry have this way of mak- 
ing every flavor perfect. The 
ingredients arc fairly simple: pep- 
permint ice cream with Oxford 
crcme cookies. Despite the little 
chunks in this flavor, the feeling 
of delight in my lummy suggests 
that this flavor is great. And al 
this point I doubt the 260 calorics 
and 17 grams of fat for one serv- 
ing will make that big of a differ- 
ence. 

RAINFOREST CRUNCH 

If you like big cashews than 
you should like Ihis flavor. This 
flavor is rich and smooth and the 
way life should be (or tasic for 
thai matter). The ingredients are 
as follows: vanilla ice cream with 
cashew-Brazil Nut Butlcrcrunch. 
But, remember those 300 calorics 
and 22 grams of fat? Yeah, 
they're in there!! 

CHERRY GARCIA 

WOW! I can not help but think 



of heaven when I digest this 
amazing ice cream. The cherry 
flavored ice cream surrounded 
with Bing Cherries and lots of 
fudge flakes is a truly unique and 
great lasting ice cream. And 
besides who cares for those 240 
calories and 16 grams of fat, it's 
too late. 

CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE 
DOUGH 

The buck stops here! This fla- 
vor takes the cake. I can not 
describe the ecstasy I felt after 
only one bite. If you love cookie 
dough like I do, than you will fall 
in love with this ice cream just by 
looking al the HUGONTIC 
chunks of cookie dough. Bui, the 
sad news about this ice cream is 
the 280 calories and the 17 grams 
offal. Bui who cares anymore. 
PEANUT BUTTERCUP 

Last, but certainly not least, this 
flavor is a peanut butter lover's 
delight. The chunks of REAL 
peanut butter cups are wildy 
addicting. I love it! I love It! I 
love it! What 1 am trying to say 
here is. I LOVE IT!!! So go 
ahead, sit back and have a serving 
of 340 calorics and 24 grams of 
fat and enjoy!!

Legalizing fireworks 
will bring income here 



If the bill now in ihc Senate 
passes, residents of Indiana over the 
age of 18 may be able 10 buy fire- 
works anytime this summer. 

I in- measure was inserted into a 
bill whieh previously dealt with 
licensing termite inspectors. 

Opponents of the bill say thai 
fireworks pose safety hazards. 

What lawmakers fail 10 com- 
ment on is the current situation in 
Indiana regarding fireworks. 

Al present Indiana residents 
drive to neighboring states to buy 
fireworks, arid then come back to 
Indiana and use them. Residents 
have generally not been deterred by 
laws prohibiting ibis practice. 

The current laws concerning 
fireworks in Indiana take business 
away from this stale, and send it to 
neighboring states. The fireworks 
sale bams which sprout up just over 
the border attest to this. 

Why continue sending Indiana 
money across the border? If this bill 
goes through, residents will be able 
to buy their fireworks right here in 
Indiana, generating income for 
Indiana vendors. 

Those legislators who arc 
dwelling on the issue of safely arc 
missing the point. Indiana residents 
can buy fireworks here, but only 
during the Fourth of July and New 



Years season. If they buy them here 
then they use them here, even if 
they sign a waiver that says they 
won't. They have been using them 
for years, and will continue to use 
them. 

Those that arc concerned about 
safely should realize they will be 
belter able to regulate the use of 
fireworks if they make ihem legal. 
Currently all police can do is tell 
people not to use them. 

Al the moment, the bill's future 
is uncertain. If Senate President Pro 
Tempore Robert Ganon decides the 
measure is related to agriculture, 
the original topic of ihc bill, the bill 
will most likely be sent to cormnii- 
tee. 

If the bill is sent to committee 
who knows when it will resurface, 
maybe never. If the bill docs get 
buried, the issue certainly has not 
died. As long as Indiana residents 
buy and use fireworks it is relevant. 

Lawmakers in the House and 
Senate need to realize this and 
make sure the issue of fireworks is 
considered, whether in this bill or 
another. Until then, Indiana will 
continue to lose revenue to border- 
ing stales and residents will contin- 
ue to use fireworks, illegally and 
unregulated. Is this really what we 



Letters to the Editor 



Professors' outing not vital 



I feel that it is necessary for me 
to respond to Paul Tupper's column 
of April 13, 1995. I realize that 
many have seen fit to respond lo 
Paul's column for a variety of rea- 
sons and my voice will be just one 
more. Out since Paul used my 
name in his column without asking 
my permission, or informing me of 
the context in which he was going 
to use it, 1 feel thai a response is in 
order, 

First, I wish 10 commend Paul 
on his editorial effort to make the 
campus community aware of the 
presence and contributions of the 
gay minoriiy, even if I often dis- 
agree with the manner in with be 
does it. Secondly. I thank him for 
the profuse compliments he paid 
me. However, I must caution him 
that using an individual's name 
without permission can be danger- 
ous and possibly libelous. I am noi 



Divulging sexuality not necessary 



Paul - you've done it again, I 
congratulate your fervor, especially 
in your arguments aboul the much 
needed diversity on this campus, 
but you've made the wrong 
assumption - again . 

Cultural diversity is a very 
important issue, especially at an 
institution of higher learning, but 
has it ever occurred to you that an 
instructor may not feel its appropri- 
ate to ihc atmosphere of his or her 
class to say: This semester we will 
be reviewing the works of William 
Shakespeare, and by the way, I'm 
gay." A person's sexuality is some- 
times a very private subject, it's not 
something that most people carry 
around on their chest like a badge - 
we have 100 many badges already. 

Jusi because there are few 
instructors on campus as open 
aboul their sexuality as Larry Life, 
or as sexually militant as you are, 
doesn'i mean we don't have that 
kind of diversity at IPFW. Some 
instructors do not choose to share 
something thai intimate with their 
students, or they simply feel thai 



their sexuality is just a pan of who 
ihey are - it doesn'i make them 
special or different, and their choice 
may have nothing to do wiih fear of 
losing their job. 

Until people begin 10 understand 
that a person's sexuality is their 
business, to keep private or make 
public as they choose, and that sex- 
uality is a normal part of life, there 
will always be discrimination. I'm 
not sure a person's sexuality meets 
the same needs for diversity as race, 
it is not something that normally 
comes out at a job interview. That 
is NOT to say that an employer has 
the right to terminate someone they 
believe or know to be homosexual, 
bui that is another argument. 

Keep searching for diversity — it 
only serves lo broaden our under- 
standing of people, even ourselves, 
but don't assume just because you 
can't sec ihe kind of diversity that 
you are searching for. thai it's not 
there,

Commentary 



Earth day important to 
students and citizens alike 



- by Robert Squatrita - Editorial Cartoonist 



objecting to his identifying me as 
gay. I am gay and very proud of it. 
I do object to his identifying me as 
the only openly gay faculty mem- 
ber on this campus. 1 most certainly 
am not. I may be the most vocal 
and visible one, but lhat is my per- 
sonal choice. I do not believe that 
my gay colleagues should necessar- 
ily do the same, nor should it be 
implied by an editorial using my 
name that tiiey arc less liian respon- 
sible human beings if they chose 
not 10 announce their sexual orien- 
tation. 

I am afraid that the implications 
of Paul's last column smacks of 
"outing" and I want lo go on record 
as saying lhat I in no way condone 
or encourage such action. 

Sincerely, 

Larry Life 



Earth Day is Sunday. If what I

cation of people's actions then I

libs

deal." That 


Megan 


McArdle 


kind of atti- 
tude doesn't 




do anyone any good. 

The environment is important 
- a lot more important 
than many peopl 
realize. Yes, 
recyclin 
save 
trees, but 
the trees 
aren't 
in too 
much 
danger. 
The 
problem 
is the 
waste we 
generate, 
we continue the 
way we have been 
the United Slates will be 
nolhing but a giant trash heap by 
Ihe year 2000. (Looking around I 
wonder thai ii isn't one already.) 

Recent events concerning the 
Chemical Waste facility should 
help wake people up. 

Why are these citizens con- 
cerned? They do not want a trash 
dump in their backyard. But they 
are perfectly willing to set their 
trash out on their curb every day 
without a care as to where it 
goes. 

This is what Earth Day is all 
about - being aware of how our 
actions affect the environment. 
What we do affects every other 
person on this Earth, some more 
directly lhan others. This is 



something that many people in 
ihe United Stales fail lo realize. 

Before we act we need to con- 
sider how our actions will affcel 
other people. 

Yes, i! is easier to throw your 
batteries in the hash than to recy- 
cle (hem, but whose drinking 
water is that polluting? Just 
because it is not your drinking 
water does not mean ii doesn't 
matter. Of course it matters. 
Everything we do matters. 

Earth Day'is a day lo put 
things into perspective and to 
remind us thai we are responsible 
for our environment. If ihe envi- 
ronment is destroyed then 
eventually we will 
be destroyed 
because we 
depend on 
the Earth 
for our 
liveli- 
hood. I 
think 
some- 
thing 
(his 
important 
deserves 
more than a 
who cares." 
The Biology 
Club is sponsoring sever- 
al speakers and events designed 
lo remind people of (he impor- 
tance of the Earth, and offer 
some ways we can be environ- 
mentally friendly. 

Instead of ignoring this issue 
we need lo embrace it. Thai does 
not mean hug a tree. It means be 
environmentally aware. That 
ranges from joining a watchdog 
organization lo simply recycling 
your newspapers. Every litile bit 
helps. Remember, this Earth is 
the only one we have, we need to 
take care of it.

Homosexually Speaking 

Openness at work important 



Whether you like it or not," 
work is a major part of your life. 
You are there for forty hours a 
week, or more, and you deal 
with these same people on a 
day-io-day basis. With lhai in 
mind, how important is it lhat 
your employer and your co- 
workers know your sexual ori- 
entation? I think it is very 
important. 

Although wc might say we 
make a conscious effort to sepa- 
rate our work from our home 
life, can we really do that? 
When you have a fight with 




want to talk about your relation- 
ship at work, whether that dis- 
cussion is positive or negative. 
But some gay people think that 
this cannot be done because of 
the nature of their relationship. 
To some extent they are right. 

Coming out at work is condi- 
tional. Do so only if the condi- 
tions are right. For instance, I 
sell women's shoes in a better 
department store. Since there 
are some stereotypes that sug- 
gest I. as a gay man, should 
work in retail because of my 
innate fashion sense, it is better 
for me to be out. I literally have 
women lining up and waiting 
for my assistance. Being on 
commission, I benefit from 
being open about myself. 

Being out at work has been 
one of the most satisfying 
aspects about my job. I have 
worked in other atmospheres 
that did not allow me to be so 
open and it caused me great 



stress. 

Now the question I am start 
ing lo ask myself is, "Should I 
be this open once I enter the real 
world?" Well. I'd like to think 
so. Bui I know 1 have lo handle 
it differently. At my current job, 
being gay was almost a require- 
ment. I was able lo be gay from 
the start. But in many other 
jobs, being gay can stifle your 
career. You may not be fired, 
but you may never be promoted 
either. Take caution. 

I have a friend who thinks 
that the best way to handle the 
situation is to get hired, do the 
best job you can, prove you arc 
an asset to the company and 
then, if you feel comfortable, 
come out lo those you tnisl al 
work. I totally agree with ihis. 
Who are wc kidding? In a per- 
fect world, wc could all be out 
24 hours a day, seven days a 
week without any worries aboul 
discrimination. But until every 
company adds sexual orienta- 
tion to their discrimination 
clauses, we cannot all be 
assured that coming out will not 
be harmful to our careers. 

If you are worried that your 
gay life will interfere with your 
work life, ask about discrimina- 
tion when you look for employ- 
ment. "Am I as a homosexual 
protected from discrimination?" 
The companies which are gay 
friendly deserve to have you 
work for them. 

If you arc currently in a job 
thai does not have a sexual ori- 
entation clause, sec how hard it 
would be lo have one added. 
Ask around, you may find that 
you have more people on your 
side than you think. Hopefully 
your employer will listen lo 
your voices and make that 
change.
