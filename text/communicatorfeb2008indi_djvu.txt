Power tfip: 

l^etworkers who rebel agiinsj the nf|achirie 



By SAID EL-DAJANI 

eld^Diarpfwedu 



iBehind the ze- 

rqs and ones, ma- 
trtces and ptogram- 
m^g languages, lies 
a JTomplex and cime 
consuming lifesrj'le 
many Internet users 
have come to know as 
sqpial networking. 

.^omebody . call 
Morpheus; Neo is 
choosing the blue pill 
because maybe the 
matrix we call social 
networking, is too ex- 
hausting of an entity 
tO'keep up with. 

Some argue that 
in the current social 
climate, Web sites 
like Facebook and 
Myspace are becom- 
ing indispensable 
networking tools. 

Others say that it's 
just a waste of time. 

Fed up with a three 
- year addiction to so- 
cial networking, Dan- 
non Schroeder, senior 
Art Education major 
at IPFW, decided to 
make a change. 

"I'm not trying to 
make a statement," 
he said, "I just don't 
see it (Facebook) as a 
positive thing." 

Our Neo for this 
story who a few weeks 
ago quit Facebook- 
the much recognized 
U.S. based social net- 




working site, is try- 
ing (j)o thanks to the 
confusion of friends,) 
to nqj look back at his 
decision. 

Lojig time friend 
and jFacebook user, 
Fabian Louton, 
surpi}ised by what 
seen^d like Schro- 
eder'5 impulsive and 
amb\yalent decision. 

"I^Ip not like he's 
out pf touch," said 
Louton, "but it's a 
matter of time. He'll 
be back." 

Schroeder, who 
was turned off by 
immature content 
displayed and wast- 
ed time, needs the 
break. 

"You know how you 
have something to 
do," said Schroeder. 

"But check your 
Facebook three times 
before you do any- 
thing- well that's 
over." 

According to a 
CNN.com article, giv- 
ing up social networks 
has been a trend dur- 
ing religious observa- 
tions such as Lent. 

Some give up choc- 
olate or coffee, why 
not a social network? 

Maybe the nega- 
tive response 
comes from 
what Om Ma- 
lik of Gigaom. 
com describes 
as Facebook 
bankruptcy. 



"BanwuptcieL _. 
ten cont as a tesult 
of e.ifcess and 'i poor 
iment, al case 
for those who ai^ get- 
ting fed up with'J^ace- 
book." 

"Part of myOhesi- 
tance to join iFace- 
book was because I've 
seen the al! consum- 
lature it has on 
people," says Megan 
Ford, former IPFW 
student. 

Ford, who is tak- 
ing time off school 
to be with her new- 
born, wanted to 
be connected with 
friends and acknowl- 
edges her addictive 
tendency and slight 
narcissism. 

"I think 
I am the 



son onlFacebook i 
am in Seal life said 
Ford. 1 "Ma&gt;be 
hotter Qf thats 
possiblt." 

Wifli the , 
identitlj we I 
try ami bal- 
ance, ftiaybe 
online 1 social 
networking is 
less likS the matrix 
and a little more like 
Spider 6Man. 

UiVcle Ben may 
have bdeo a wise man 
when he said, "With 
great power, comes 
great responsibility."

Got a spring break 
vacation on the brain? 
When minimum 

wage is all thie bacon 
you're bringing home, 
planning ahead for any 
substantial spending is 
essential. 

However much I 
lilce to say I save my 
pennies without even a 
second thought, that's 
a dirty lie. 

If there's a dollar in 
my checking account, I 
will spend it. 



Of course I needed 
that 900-thread count 
sheet set from Macy's 
. . . right? 

In fact, I have an 
account dedicated 
solely to vacations 
and other splurges, 
offered by banks like 
Wachovia. 

Many different 
offers are available, so 
shop around for the 
savings or checking 
accounts that are 
right for you. 

KnowledgeNugget: 
money should never 
EVER just sit in an 
account, and that 
includes checking/ 



savings accounts. yielding moneymaker 

I have a problem with that works for me, 

budgeting. To remedy instead of the other 

"Planning ahead 

for any substantial 

spending Is essential." 



that, I immediately 
transfer money into a 
savings account, which 
forces me to live within 
(and not beyond) my 



The savings account 
is a high interest, high 



way around. 

Here are some idiot- 
proof ways to make 
your minimum wage 
jump through hoops 
for you: 

Shop around for 
the best account rates. 



There are plenty of 
account services that 
will allow your money 
to sit stagnant, waiting 
for you to move it. 

Be proactive and 
surf the Web for better 
options. 

But be aware that 
many of these accounts 
require minimum 

balances, which isn't 
necessarily a bad 
thing. 

Read the fme print. 
Know ahead of time 
what kind of penalties 
are involved if you 
have an emergent need 
for cash that requires 
you to dip below the 



minimum balance. 

Also, take some time 
to learn what works for 
you. 

Knowing your 

spending habits can be 
a priceless investment. 

Like I said, monkey 
see money in account, 
monkey spend money. 

Figure out if you're 
a monkey like me, if 
you can withstand the 
temptation. 

And above all, take 
what you know and use 
it to your advantage. 

The future you will 
be thankful that you're 
so smart now. 



Ex post facto! Disappear! 

Telecom^spying lawsuits vanish in a puff of Senate magic 




By DOUSLAS SCHMIDT 

schmdnOieipfw.edu 



The Senate has 
passed new surveillance 
legislation that, if 
approved by the 
House, would grant 
telecommunications 
companies retroactive 
immunity for their 
involvement in President 
Bush's warrantless 

domestic spying 

program. 

The bill could put an 
end to do/^ns of telecom 
lawsuits before they have 
a chance for a judicial 
ruling. 



Indiana Senators 
Evan Bayh and Richard 
Lugar were among 
those voting in favor 
of the controversial 
legislation. Presidential 
candidates Sen. Barack 
Obama and Sen. Hillary 
Clinton did not vote. 

The bill, S. 2248. is 
an update to the 1976 
Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act. The 
original legislation 

required intelligence 
agents to obtain 
permission from the 
Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Court 

to listen in on 
communications inside 
the United States. 



However, shortly after 
the September 11 attacks. 
President Bush authorized 
a wiretapping program 
that monitored telephone 
calls and emails without 
Else approval: the 
National Security Agency's 
"Terrorist Surveillance 
Program". 

'The program operated 
with the cooperation 
of telecommunications 
companies Verizon 

Communications, Inc., 
AT&amp;T and others. 

This new Senate bill 
would make the telecoms 
immune to any threat of 
lawsuits for their actions 
since the program began. 

Proponents of the 



program, such as Kansas 
Republican Sen. Pat 
Roberts, have argued 
tliat the program is legal. 

It falls under 
the President's 

constitutional autliority 
as Commander-in-Chief 
and the powers granted 
to the executive office 
by the The Authorization 
for Use of Military Force 
Against Terrorists. 

This ivas a joint 
resoludon passed shordy 
after the September U. 
2001 attacks. 

However, it seems 
difficult to understand 
why telecom immunity is 
necessary if the program 
was perfectly legal. 



The American 

Bar Association, law 
professors from Har\'ard, 
The George Washington 
University and Boston 
College and otlier legal 
experts spoke out against 
the program, questioning 
the President's authority 
to engage in warrantless 
surveillance. 

After a lawsuit in 2006 
by the American Civil 
Liberties Union, U.S. 
District Judge An naDiggs 
Taylor ruled the program 
to be unconstitutional. 
However, theSixth Circuit 
Court of Appeals ruled 
that the ACLU had no 
legal standing to sue the 
NSA as the organization 
could not prove that 
jt was the target of 
surveillance, and the 
program continued. 

Also, critics of the 
bill such as MSNBC 
commentator Keith 

Olbermann have called 
the retroactive immunity 
for telecoms in the 
Senate bill an "ex post 
facto" law. 

Article 1 of the U.S. 
Constitution specifically 
prohibits ex post facto 
laws, legislation that 
changes the legality of 
actions after die fact. 

The House version 
of die bill, H.R. 
3373, does not give 
telecommunications 
companies retroactive 
immunity. 

According to the 



Associated Press, 

President Bush strongly 
favors the Senate version 
of the bill. President 
Bush said that federal 
intelligence agencies 
"need the cooperation 
of telecommunication 
companies. If these 
companies are subjected 
to lawsuits that could 
cost them billions of 
dollars... they won't help 
protect America." 

Even if the Senate's 
bill does not pass the 
House, Americans could 
still be protected from 
terrorism. Intelligence 
agents were able to 
provide information 
about terrorist threats 
even before the Terrorist 
Surveillance Program 
began. 

On August 6, 2001, 
President Bush was 
presented with a briefing 
entided "Bin Laden 
determined to strike in 
US." 

The briefing warned 
thaf'BinLadenimpliedin 
U.S. television interviews 
...that his followers would 
follow the example of 
World TVade Center 
bomber Ramzi Yousef 
and 'bring the fighting 
to America.' ... FBI 
information since that 
time indicates patterns 
of suspicious activity in 
this country. consistent 
with preparations for 
hijackings."

at $145 billion. End the virar in Iraq. 

According to an article According to the latest 

in Investor's Business Gallup polls, most

"The federal government could 

provide a stimulus of half a trillion 

dollars. There are a few key ares 

that could be cut to provide it " 



spending under the 
Bush administradon 
has been aroimd 20 
percent of the Gross 
Domestic Product, 

Money consumed 
by the government is 
not available forprivate 
sector investment, 
wliich means fewer 
jobs, lower paychecks 
and smaller savings 
accounts. 

To truly help the 
economy, the federal 
government could 
provide a stimulus of 
half a trillion dollars. 

There are a few key 



that the war was a 
mistake and that the 
government should 
either set a time table 
forremoving the troops 
or withdraw as soon as 
possible. 

Many of the troops 
apparendy agree; 

Federal Election 

Commission reports 
show that antiwar 
candidate Rep. Ron 
Paul has received 
more donations 

from members of the 
military than any other 
candidate. 

Ending the war 



in Iraq would save 
taxpayers roughly$100 
billion a year. 

Cut the remaining 
defense budget by two- 
thirds. The national 
defense budget for 
2008 is $696 billion. 

Not counting the 
$189 billion forthewars 
inlraqandAfghanistan, 
the budget is still $507 
billion. 

According to 

the Stockholm 

International Peace 
Research Institute, 
the nearest non-allied 
competitor to the 
U.S. is China, with an 
annual military budget 
of only $48.7 billion. 

The United Stales 
could cut its budget by 
two-thirds and it would 
still spend $169 billion 
a year, over three times 
as much as China. 

This would save 
aroimd S338 billion a 
year. 

Eliminate the

In 2004, Scaled 
Composites launched 
SpaceShipOne into 
sub-orbit, proving that 
a privately- funded 
aircraft could make a 
successful space flight. 

Private ventures like 
Scaled Composite's 
would be for profit 
and, thus, likely much 
cheaper than the Space 
Shuttie's cost of $1.4 
billion per flight. 

Using 2008 budget 
figures, eliminating 
NASA would save 
around $17 billion a 
year. 

End farm subsidies. 
Contrary to popular 
belief, farm subsidies 



A 2007 report 
by Citizens Against 
Government Waste 
states that "The reality 
is that only a handful of 
wealthyfarmersbenefit 
from a continuation of 
the subsidy system. 
...It is also costiy to 
taxpayers and raises 
prices to consumers. 
...in addition to 
further impoverishing 
farmers in developing 
countries." 

Eliminating farm 
subsidies would save 
around $20 billion a 
year. 

Finally, enact 

legislative reforms to 
cut down on "pork 



"Ending the war in Iraq 
would save taxpayers 
roughly $100 billion per 
year." 



Waste identified $29 
billion in earmarks 
wherein members of 
Congress were abusing 
the legislative process 
to "promote their own 
re-elections andreward 
special interests." 

RestrictingCongress 
members' ability to add 
earmarks to spending 
bills could save $20 
billion to $30 billion a 
year. 

These are just a few 
examples of budget 
cuts and reforms that 
Congress could make 
to put half a trillion 
back in the pockets of 
taxpayers. 

Regardless of which 
programs are cut, the 
important thing is 
that the government 
provides a real 
economic stimulus. 

Simply printing

Mom Always Knows Best 



By JESSIE RUCKMAN 

nj{li)l(l ieipfw.edu 



My mom is an abso- 
lute genius. Whei 
very impressionable, she 
pulled my sister and me 
aside and said "don't buy 
the car until you've taken 
it on a test drive." 



I innocent youth, 
1 never realized she was 
talking about the 
lalion between good sex 
and good relationships. 
It wasn't until much later 
in life did 

that men really are like 
cars. Since I figured that 
riddle out, I tend to apply 
the J. Ruckman theory to 
the dating life. 

And the 



plunge', ] believe she also 
meant 'keep your options 
open and never ever settle 
for less than what you de- 
serve. 

But how do you fig- 
ure out what you di 
and/or want in a partner 
anyivay? When and how 
does the knowledge de- 
velop? 

That's easy; date a va- 
riety of people and enjoy 
the experiences. Here are 
some excellent reasons 
that support this idea: 

Reason #1: Never, 
EVER just dale one person 
at a time. Why? So what 
if you're star struck right 
away, and your compan- 
ion seems to be Mr. Per- 
fect? That romantic 
of perfection fades away, 
leaving you with Hie jaw- 
clicking, butt scratching 



real version, and not the 
haloed darling you fell for 
in the first place. So wait. 
Watch. And find out if 
this person is really what 
you want -genuinely 

-.Reason #2: Play it 
smart and shop around 
for someone who really 
fits you, flaws and all. 
How many people in your 
high school circle or fam- 
ily have ended up with an 
absolute jackass simply 
because they settled too 
quickly? One easy way 
to do that is to keep your 
options open and have 
fun - gelling too serii 
too soon is one surefire 
way to make 'em run, and 
cheat you out of some 
good times. 

Reason #3: Il's not a 
reason really - but hey, we 
are working with a theme 



By LOUISA DAMIELSON 

danllaD}@ipfw.edu 

Some composers 

manage a musical wander 
every so often - Strauss 
and his "Blue Danube", 
Liszt and his "Hungar- 
ian Rhapsody No. 2" and 
Bruch with his "Scot- 
tish Fantasy". But Mozart 
managed to keep the mu- 
sic coming, and kept it 
popular. This is probably 
why orchestras can do 
entire concerts devoted 
10 the master's works - or 
mostly 

In their February 9 
concert, the Fort Wayne 
Philharmonic performed 
"Mosdy Mozart" high- 
lighting some of the com- 
poser's lighter works. They 
also presented a bassoon 
concerto by Von Weber. 

Opening with the so- 
bering tones of the Over- 
ture to Don Giovanni, the 



audience

audience was exposed to 
a glaring red lighl reflect- 
itiH off the scrim behind 
the orchestra. In stark 
contrast were the listen- 
ing heads against the 
dim theater as the music 
climbed up exaggerated 
crescendos and skipped 
through spice atos. 

The next piece was 
the Symphony no. 46 
(officially K. 96 or 11 lb. 



movement was like a Re- 
naissance dance, sel with 
a slower tempo while the 
third movement was like 
a Haydn march. The fi- 
nal movement contained 
a nice jumble of musical 
sections, the different in- 
struments taking turns 
with the melody. 

Then came theVon We- 
ber Concerto for Bassoon 
in F Major (!. 127).Tchiv- 



"The listening heads were 

in stark contrast against 

the dim theater as the 

music climbed." 



due to an error with the 
original printer). Labeled 
the Italian symphony of 
WoKart by conductor Ed- 
vard Tchivzhel, this piece 
opened with quick, laugh- 
ing strings. The second 



zhel noted that Von We- 
ber "( W)as mostly known 
as the Father of Romantic 
German opera," but that 
this concerto "shows the 
bassoon's great abiUty...{it 
has (a) heroic sound, (a) 



very l&gt;Tical, buffo char- 
acter which shows very 
much in the finale. ..(Von 
Weber) treated the in- 
strument like (a voice)." 
Tchivzhel concluded. 

Bassoonist Dennis 
Pick entered the stage 
and played the entire 
work with fine facility. As 
the conductor had noted, 
the music had a uniquely 
lyrical sound, as though 
the bassoon had taken 
the part of an alto or ten- 
or operatic singer. Full of 
trills and twiriing, spin- 
ning runs, the concerto 
finished with a movement 
much like a dance; the 
bassoon seemed to call 
the musical figures for 
the orchestra to follow. At 
the close. Pick received a 
standing ovation. He also 
gave the signal for the 
orchestra to take a bow 
himself. 

Following the inter- 
mission, the last two 



Hein 



pieces of the concert were 
the Divertimento No. 1 in 
e-flat major and the S^tti- 
phony no. 31 in D Major 
("Paris"). Tchivzhel noted 
that "Mozart wrote huge 
amounts of pieces for en- 
tertainment. ..for any kind 
of festivities." This par- 
ticular Divertimento was 
used as part of a wedding. 
Special to this work was 
the melody which par- 
ticularly brought out the 
soul of the string sound in 
the first movement. "You 
canuse this piece for your 
wedding, too," Tchivzhel 
noted at the close. 
Of the final music for the 
evening, Tchivzhel said, 
"It was (a) great success, 
but it was also a tragic 
time for Mozan." Shortly 
after the performance of 
this Paris symphony, Mo- 
zart's mother died. Evi- 
dently, the composer was 
so affected by her passing 
that he was unable to tell 



rn^t

Philharmonic 



his father about it, save to orous chords, delicate 
write that "she is not good, viohn work and a grand 
but nothing fatal." The scale amongst the second 
symphony, however, was violins finished the work, 
a grand success due to the earning Tchiv'zhel two 
'rocket' theme al the be- bows, 
ginning. Listeners to the 
first performance Mozari 
gave in Paris were so 
excited that they 
"started to ap- 
plaud and 



expect 
you to 
do that 

(10- 

night),' 

he said. 

This 
piece had 
rapid, lively 

scaling 

at the start. Vig- 




culture influences IPFW student's new clothing line 



efii of the doubt. 

So began our discus- 
sion of Hein's recent 
venture and endeavour: 
a clothing line to be 
known as Flavoraurus 
Threads- 
Recognizing tlie 
quality behind Ameri- 
can Apparel clothing, 
Hein's friend David Gize 
iniiiated the idea of us- 
ing the brand. 

Once Hein felt the 
soft texture and took 
note of the versatile 



color combinations, the 
vision clicked. 

It was then impor- 
tant for the new de- 
signer to understand 
a target market for his 
clothing line. 

Partnering with Gize, 
a design savvy student 
at lU Bloomington, 
and local musician, 
Jonny Kalt, the trio de- 
cided their brightly col- 
ored threads were to 
be geared towards the 
punk, Warp Tour scene. 



Hein didn't want to 
sit on the idea, so he 
did what most young 
entrepreneurs wouldn't 
have. 

"It's a legitimate 
business," said Hein. 

"I registered with the 
state and federal gov- 
ernment lor tax pur- 
poses." 

It was key for Hein 
to market his new con- 
cept, and followed so by 
strategically doing what 
most college age stu- 



dents abuse: Myspace 
and Facebook. 

By creating a group 
on each social network, 
he sent out bulletins 
and messages that ef- 
fectively gave out infor- 
mation regarding the 
new brand, and most 
recently, a sliirt release 
party. 

The party would 
showcase bands such 
as The Melliod to My 
Medium, The Ready Set, 
DJ Epitaph, and more 



importantly, feature tlie

plications by March 10, 
2008 in order to be con- 
sidered for possible Indi- 
ana aid, as well as Federal 
funding. 

"IFillingoutaFAFSAI 
opens up potential op- 
portunities for financial 
aid they [studentsi may 
not be aware of," associ- 
ate director of financial 



aid Gerald Curd said. 

It is imponant to 
note that the applica- 
tion must be fiJed every 
year, as income levels 
and class standings are 
subject to change an- 
nually. Even if a student 
believes he or she might 
not be eligible for grants, 
or does not want to ac- 
cept a Stafford loan, it Is 
a good rule of thumb to 
file every year. 

According to Curd, 
conunon mistakes stu- 
dents frequently make 
when filling out their 
FAFSA are skipping ques- 
tions, not correctly indi- 
cating who is living in 
the household, and giv- 
ing wrong information 



about tax returns. 

Because the FAFSA 
can be filled out elec- 
tronically, writing errors 
and skipping questions 
have become less fre- 
quent. Other mistakes 
oftentimes go unnoticed, 
as only a third of all stu- 
dents who apply for fi- 
nancial aid are audited by 
the government. Accord- 
ing to Curd, these audits 
are usually random. 

Also keep in mind 
that class standing is 
determined by the num- 
ber of hours completed, 
not the number of years 
you have been attend- 
ing college, which tends 
to cause some confusion 
among students. 




Freshman standing is 
a student with less Uian 
30 hours completed, a 
sophomore standing re- 
quires at least 30 hours 
completed, junior stand- 
ing is at least 60 hours, 
and senior standing is a 
minimum of 90 hours. 
An academic advisor can 
update a student of their 
class standing if neces- 
sary. 

it is best to file an ap- 
plication online at www. 
FAFSA.ed.gov for effi- 
ciency and accuracy, or 
if you need to make cor- 
rections. The application 
process is free, and if a 
website asks you to pay a 
fee, you are on the wrong 
page.

Is IPFW safe from a 
campus shooting? 

Recent acts of violence at univerities evoke 
anxiety, concern about campus safety 



By KATY ANDERSON 

Aiide)mOiaipriv.«lu 



If college life was not 
daunting enough, re- 
cent campus shootings 
seen in the news within 
the past year, most no- 
tably the Northern Illi- 
nois University and the 
Virginia Tech tragedies, 
can now intensify a stu- 
dent, parent, and fac- 
ulty members anxiety 
towards their peers and 
environment. 

Perhaps the most dis- 
turbing aspects of cam- 
pus shootings are how 
imexpectedly and in- 
explicably they occur. 
Last week, Stephen Ka- 
zmierczak shot 22 people 
at Northern Illinois Uni- 
versity', ultimately killing 
five smdenis as well as 
himself- 

Before Kazmierczak 
entered that crowded 
lecture hall and began 
firing, the former student 
of NIU had been highly 
esteemed by many of his 
professors, having even 
won a Dean's award. 

Another infamous 
event occurred last April 
at Virginia Tech Universi- 
ty. Most sttidenis had re- 
garded a student named 
Seung-Hui Cho as a quiet 
but also disturbed stu- 
dent. 

Unlike Kazmierczak, 
Cho had alarmed his 
peers and professors pri- 
or to the massacre, and 
had received warnings 
from campus police for 
stalking and harassing 
other students accord- 



ing to the Washington 
Post. Despite the scru- 
tiny of his professors, 
psychiatrists, and fellow 
students, Cho was still 
able to single-handedly 
kill 32 students and fac- 
ulty members as well as 
himself. 

Though these tragic 
events are seemingly un- 
predictable and difficult 
to avert, smdents can 
still inform themselves 
about the precautions 
that should be taken in 
the event that such a 
confrontation should oc- 
cur. 

"They [campus shoot- 
ings) can happen any- 
where," IPFW Lieutenant 
Barry Markin said, "The 
best thing [for students 
and faculty] to do is to 
just stay calm." 

The Campus Annual 
Security Report provides 
general guidelines and 
poUcies that are to be 
followed if there is an 
armed subject or active 
shooter silDation on the 
campus. 

If a shooter is not in- 
side the building, sm- 
dents and faculty should 
proceed to a room that 
can be locked. Once 
reaching the room, turn 
off the lights and call 911 
to inform the dispatchers 
what is happening and 
where you are located. 

The report also advis- 
es that individuals locked 
in the room should not 
respond to any outside 
voices unless they know 
for certain that the com- 
mands are being issued 
by a police officer. 

The same instructions 
apply if the shooter is in 
the building, but if the 



room cannot be locked, 
one should determine 
whether or not there is a 
safe way to exit the build- 
ing. If one does decide to 
Qee, they need to have a 
plan or route in mind, re- 
frain from carrying any- 
thing, move quickly, and 
keep their hands visible. 
The report also insuiicts 
that those fleeing should 
not attempt to remove 
wounded victims, but in- 
stead, notify authorities 
of the victims' location 
as soon as possible. 

Forcibly attacking the 
perpetrator should be 
the last resort if one Is 
directly confronted with 
a shooter and the situa- 
tion has been exhausted 
of any other resolution. 

Like many universities 
across the coimtry, IPFW 
Is also in the process of 
developing systems that 
use text messages, phone 
calls, and email to notifj' 
students and faculty if 
there is an emergency 
situation. This system is 
to be tested sometime in 
the future, according to 
Markin. 

Although the campus 
seems small in size, the 
IPFW Police Department 
is staffed twenty-four 
hours a day, seven days 
a week, and their per- 
sonnel consists of fifteen 
police officers, two safety 
officers, and five clerk/ 
dispatchers. 

Each year, a publica- 
tion of the Campus An- 
nual Security Report is 
available online and can 
be viewed at http:/ /www.

Video Games Live combiner 
retro theatre experience 
with contemporary themes 



By SANA SZEWCZYK 

SlfwiyOieipFw.edu 



Last Friday dckets 
were available in the An- 
thropology department 
for a sold out show at the 
Embassy Theater called 
"Video Games Live." 
IPFW was one of 
the main sponsors of 
this show. Because the 
show was viewed at the 
Embassy, many used the 
night as an opportunity 
to look and feel fabu- 
lous. Many girls used the 
night of the show to buy 
new dresses and wear 
high heel sparkly shoes. 

The show did not start 
until 6:00 p.m. but the 
streets and parking lots 
were filled with parked 
cars hours before the 
showstaned. Astreamof 
people filled the streets 



ofdowntown FortWayne 
as they walked toward 
the beaming lights of the 
Embassy Theater. 

The corridors, stairs 
and lobby were full of 
people of different ages. 
The Embassy that night 
looked like a castle from 
a fairytale. The atmo- 
sphere felt like a ^ry 
tale especially after my 
daughter lost her shoe 
four different times on 
the stairs and every time 
Prince Charming came 
up to me and asked, "Ex- 
cuse me, did you lose this 
shoe?" handing me her 
sparkly red slipper. 

The Video Games 
Live show was a com- 
bination of over fifty 
video game clips pro- 
jected on a screen In the 
background. Music was 
played by the FortWayne 
Philharmonic Sympho- 
ny Orchestra and was 



conducted by lack Wall, 
a choir, and a specially 
designed synchronized 
light show. 

Each segment was 
unique ranging from dra- 
matic and moving scenes 
from "Halo" and "God of 
War," to footage from 
World War II, to Disney 
movies we all love. 

A couple audience 
members got to play an 
interactive game on the 
stage against each oth- 
er, with one of the par- 
ticipants losing all of his 
lives. 

The performance left 
audience members feel- 
ing as though they were 
inside a video game, 
especially when snow 
started to fall from the 
ceiling. 

The show was about 
two and a half hours long 
with two encore pieces, 
though it went by fast.

IPFW. ranked lldi bounced back

Sports Center. 

The Mastodons topped the Pirates 
by the scores of 30-27, 30-20. and 30- 
28. 

Park shortened up their bench for 
this one, only playing seven players 
in the matcfi, trying to keep their 
best players on the floor against the 
Mastodons. 

The Pirates started out quickly in 
the opening game, holding the lead a 
lead at 26-24. 

[PFW called time out to regroup, 
and they did, winning six of the final 
seven points, the last on a kill by senior 
outside hitter CJ. Macias to take game 
one. 30-27. 

The 'Dons had an easier time of it 
in the second game as senior outside 
hitter Brock Ullrich put down one of 
his 10 kills to give IPFW an, 18-11 lead. 

Freshman middle Oliver Kook and 
senior opposite fason Vhost combined 
on a block to seal game two, giving the 
Dons a, 2-0 lead. 

IPFW held the lead in the final game 
for all but one point, improving to 6-4 
on the season with tlie sweep. 

Park lost for the first time after 
winning their first 11 matches. Henry 



Uribe led the Pirates with 13 kills. 

Macias also put down 13 balls for 
the Mastodons. Ullrich was the only 
other "Don in double-digit kills. 

IPFW was stout on the block, out 
blocking the Pirates, 18,5 to 5.5. Senior 
setter Graydon Ainsworth recorded five 
solo blocks and three block assists. He 
also dished out 41 assists. 

The Lewis Flyers handed visiting No. 
1 1 IPFW a, 3- 1 setback in MfVA play on 
Friday night at the Neil Carey Arena, 

The Flyers pulled the upset by the 
scores of 30-19, 28-30, 32-30. and 30- 
20.

totaling 19.5 blocks in the match. Junior 
middle Alex Vigansky led the way with 
a solo block and nine block assists.

kills. Macias and Ullrich each chipped

competitive team," Gemon noted. 

The team opens the season on February 29 with 
four games at Georgia Stale. Former IPFW assistant 
coach Blaine McFerron is the pitching coach at Georgia 
State, which helped get the series scheduled according 
to Gemon. 

From tliere, the team travels to Bradenlon, Florida 
for their annual visit to the IMG Academy. They play 
nine games in Florida before their first game at home, 
against Defiance, on March 18. 

Much to Gernon's pleasure, the team has 25 games 
at home, including hosting the conference favorite 
Oral Roberts for a weekend to end the season. Among 
marquee games this year for IPFW are visits to Indiana 
and Michigan, as well as a home game against Notre 
Dame ai Memorial Stadium. 

"I don't want to call it friendly, it's just normal now," 
said Gemon of the schedule. He also noted that hosting 
the ten-time defending conference tournament 
champions is a nice boost, especially when not much 
is expected from his team in the Summit League. 

They were picked to finish last in the Summit 
League in preseason voting. 

"In eighth place, we can! do anything ivrong." 

Not to say that Gemon is not focused on doing 
things right. Among his team's lliree main objecdves 
are making the conference toumamenl (only four 
of the eight teams do so) and \vinning that same 
tournament. But Gemon is also very focused and 
proud of his team's academic awareness. 

His team had the best GPA in the athletic 
department last semester with a 3.2 and senior pitcher 
Cole Uebelhor has a 3.9 GPA. Uebelhor is also the 
president of IPFW's Student Athlete Leadership Team. 
Uebelhor will also help with the other tivo goals. In 
2007. he recorded big wins over Iowa, Rhode Island 
and Bowling Green State. 

While Gemon is sull focused on taking one game 
at a dme, he has seen the big picture and he Is ready 



"I've prided myself on having good s 
With the right things falling into the right places, 
this could be one of the best of all. 

Mastodons stand strong, 
derail Grizzlies again 

IPFW overcame a six point half time deficit with 
some red-hot second half shooting to top Oakland, 
7I-6B at the O'Rena on Saturday night. 

The Mastodons won for just the fourth time when 
trailing at the half this year. It was their second win 
over Oakland this season. 

Oakland dominated this one early, taking a 10 
point, 23-13 lead, on a triple from junior guard Erik 
Kangas. A triple from freshman forward Will Hudson 
made it 30-19 with just 3:25 left in the opening half. 

IPFW junior forward David Carson dropped in a 
triple of his o\vn, and the Mastodons cut the OU lead 
to just six, 32-26 at the break. 

In the second half, Carson began to score at will. 
The Oakland University transfer scored IPFW's first 
seven points of the second half, cutting the Golden 
Grizzlies' lead to four at, 37-33. 

Then, senior forward DeWitt Scon began to dial 
it up fi-om behind the arc. Scott drained a three-ball 
to give the 'Dons their first lead, 41-40 at the 13:51 
mark. 

Senior forward laraun Burrows got a pair of 
buckets inside, one was part of a three-point play 
making it. 51-47. 

Oakland made one final push at the 'Dons as 
sophomore guard lohnathon lones' lay up pulled the 
Golden Grizzlies to within one at, 62-61. 

But, Scott put the final nail in the coffin with his 
final triple of the night with just :47 left. Carson led 
the Mastodons with a career-high 18 points. He also 
pulled down five boards in the contest. 

Burrows put together a 17 point night, and Scott's 
four triples figured Into his 13 point evening. 

OU junior Derick Nelson surpassed the 1,000 
point total in his career with a team-high 18 points.
