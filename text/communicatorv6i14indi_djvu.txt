New academic structure 

With nearly everything here being reorganized, replaced, or simply abolished, 
it seems logical enough thai academic re-structuring be at the front of things. The 
past few weeks saw two major steps taken toward this end.^

OPINION 



November 14. 

The departments were broken down i 
was dropped by the trustees because it ' 



to two schools. (The name "college" 
n-Purdue.) One is called the School of 
Arts and Sciences, very similar (for confusion's sake) to the I.U. Division of Arts 
and Sciences, and the other is the School of engineering and Technology. 

The local faculty WOSalSO given independence from the Purdue faculty in West 
Lafayette. Fort Wayne decisions c 
West Lafayette. 

v system is nice and all, but given the present : 



Changing society creative challenge 



e made by Fort Wayne faculty rather than In 



a new chancellor 
and unification, the structure is almost out of date already. 

The overwhelming desire on campus is for a single unified structure fur all 
academic departments Thechancdlnr has indicated he will hire a single dean of 
(acuities who will operate within a unified administrative structure. Faculty 
groups have been calling for unification for better than a year. 

The Task Force on Academic struct ure has shown itself to be in tune with this 
feeling. Its proposed structure, released November 20, would integrate all I.U. and 
Purdue departments into ;i single structure of nine centers. Each center would be 
composed of related departments, with at least one I.U. and one Purdue 
department in each center. The (ask force's intent was to speed up unification by 
doing this. 

The center concept is a new and untried one. The proposal takes this into 
account by requiring reevflluation of the concept during its first three years. At 
that point in time (he structure would be made permanent or changed. 

The proposal will receive opposition because of its newness, and this opposition 
Should be given careful consideration Others will oppose the questionable 
placement of Specific departments, notably economics and biology. In certain 
centers, but the task force has also made provision for amending Us placemen! 
decisions. 

All in all, the proposal should fare well because of its flexibility and Its 
temporary trial nature But whether i( is accepted or rejected, we hope that its 
giant step for unification is not lost. 

Good judgment 

' After witnessing years ol inaction and inter-school buck-passing on the part of 
IPFW administrators, it is encouraging to see even a small example of positive 
leadership born the new administration When Chancellor Donald Schwartz was 
liilormed recently that the early lee payment schedule could create a financial 
hardship loi many sludenls, he acted quickly and decisively to ease the problem 

Now certainly Hits lone incident did not have such far reaching significance in 
itself, had the chancellor not acted on the Student Senate request lor acted less 
quickh &gt; most students would have met I he original payment deadlines oneway or 
another Hut in this case there was no reason lor any students to experience an 
undue hardship The original deadlines were set up to insure that all processing ol 
advance registrai inns would he completed before the university's proposed holiday 
shutdown The shutdown had been planned as an energy-saving measure, but 
officials had since determined that such a move was not practical. 

Realizing this, Schwartz made the necessary arrangements with the bursar's 
office to extend the payment deadlines. He didn't spend days on the phone trying to 
get approval from Bloomington and West Lafayette and he didn't form a 
committee to study the matter. He knew the circumstances, got the facta, and 
acted, thereby averting a possible financial crisis for some students. 

We hope that Chancellor Schwartz's response to this problem 1b representative 
of the way he plans to deal with similar difficulties In the future. Although The 
Communicator has never been known to shy away from criticism of university 
administrators when warranted, neither are we above acknowledging competency 
and good judgment when they occur in high places.

WHAT SORT OF PERSON 
READS THE COMMUNICATOR? 

A woman who appreciates the power of persuasion when dealing with philosophical

corruption and sexism. Fact: 74.9 per cent of all Wonder Women read The Communi-

lucrative market for only 25 cents with a Communicator classified ($1.00 for anyon e
