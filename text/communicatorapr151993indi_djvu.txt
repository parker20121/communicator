Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne 
Winner of the 1993 ICPA Division II Advertising of the Year Award 



April IS, 1993 



Purdue's Beering holds three meetings at IPFW 



ByFelklaHeechlnE, 
Editor In Chief 
Purdue University Prcsidcni Slcvcn 
Bccring and vice picsidenls Robert 
Ringlc and Joseph Bcnncii alicndci^ 
ihrec meclings on Monday ai \PF*f. 
Stud en I leaders nl tended an in vil a lion- 
only mecling during ihc first hour; fac- 
ulty senate had a standing room only 
meeting the second hour with Bccring; 
and an open forum for faculty to ad- 
dress concerns and problems during 
Iho third hour. 



Purdue policy, and a SSOmfund to The 



Com 



c that 



ilbc V 



policy dictates that the business 
ager of IPFW cannot write checks over 
S25 without going to West Lafayette 
for approval. Her refund check came 
directly from West Lafayette, not 
IPFW, 

Beering evaded answers on every 
point. 

"Wc are not trying to make lU pro- 
fessors' tenure and promotion a Pur- 



I Purdue for tenure and promotion 
had a "typo". 

The "typo" that said ihcy would be 
"Purdue" dependent for tenure and 
promotion, should have read "Indi- 

iculiy senate 



During the student meeting, most of due decision," said Bccring. 



iho student leaders were reluctant to 
Mk questions and appeared to be unJn- 
formed about the global issues con- 
cerning IPFW and Purdue, such as fis- 
cil autonomy, budget problems, and 
the future status of LU, faculty. In- 
stead, questions about ventilation in 
the Tine arts building, childcare, and 
other local matters let Beering dcUcci 
heat from the other issues, 

"IPFW has all the fiscal autonomy it 
needs. It has almost complete tiscal au- 
tonomy." Beering told students. 

Beering denied trying to microman- 
Bgc the IPFW campus. When The 
Communicator's representative named 
three specific instances of microman- 
agcmcnl, Bccring denies knowledge of 
tUl three. 

The three specifics named were Pur- 
due's denial of decorative clocks in 
IPFW student lounges because they 
don't conform to the PU system; for- 
bidding the history and political sci- 
ence depanmcni to install new donated 
caipcting in a special room because of 



That contradicts a document sent to 
IPFW two weeks ago, that was cleared 
through Purdue University aiiomcys 
before being forwarded to this campus. 

"The new Management Agreement 
will be renewable In 1998. Wc did not 
want to moke it non- re new able," Bccr- 
ing told students. 

This contradicts what he has said in 
public meetings 
last few weeks. 

"I can't believe he thinks we're that 
dumb." said one student senator that 
did not want to be identified. 

"He avoided answering any ques- 
tions directly," said another senator. 

"At least Bccring is making an cffon 
to finally recognize students on this 
campus, although he was evasive," 
.said Rajat Sun, student body president. 

In the faculty senate meeting. Beer- 
ing said Bill Frederick, faculty senate 
presiding officer, announce that the 
document that would have been in- 
cluded in the new Management Agree- 
ment to make lU professors dependent 



Members of ihi 
laughed. 

Robert Jeskc, assistant professor of 
anthropology, read a strong statement 
in opposition to Purdue taking over 
tenure and promotion of lU faculty. 

"Even though we know that bccau.sc 
of the "type," this no longer applies, I 
still want to read it, bccau.w what wc 
received was in black and white," 
Jeskc stated to the faculty senate. 

During the open forum, questions di- 
rected at Beering were heated. 

Julius Smulkstys, associate professor 

of political .science, predicted that if 

Beering had his way, in a few years. 

lU will be missing at the Fort Wayne 

the press in the campus. 

Michael Downs had the roc 
ing when he told President 
"Dr. Beering has been to sec us four 
times in the last month and Dr. Ringle 
has been here twice and this is proof 
that eating an apple a day doesn't 
work." 

After the meetings, Steve Hollander, 
assistant professor of English and lin- 
guistics, said, "The good news is that 
Beering is backtracking partially on 
how much he wants to control the lU 
faculty and backtracking on his plan 
for a perpetual agreement in the new 
Management Agreement." 

"In five years, maybe he (Beering) 



n laugh- 



i be here, or he will be more 111 
b!c," concluded Hollander. 

Art Finco, speaker for the Purdue 
faculty at IPFW said, "Frankly, I was 
disappointed by the questions asked 
(by the faculty) that lel President Bccr- 
ing off the hook." 

"We should have asked questions 
about the IPFW Management Agree- 
ment proposal written by a faculty 
committee with IPFW administration's 
input," said Finco. "We should have 
asked President Beering to address the 
diKumeni, to obtain his rationale for 
disagreeing with all or pan of it." 

Chancellor Joanne Lantz told the 
faculty that it was her idea to make the 
lU faculty Purdue employees. She ad- 
mitted that President Beering thought 
of the idea almost ten years ago, but 
thai she thinks the retirement benefits 
for lU faculty hired since 1989 is too 
tmcqual. 

"lU faculty receive 20 percent less 
retirement benefits than PU faculty," 
said Lantz. "That is unfair." 

Indiana University faculty seem 
unimpressed. 

One anonymous lU professor said, 
"Ucnetits vary, l^or a while Purdue's 
will be better; then lU's will be better. 
It aU evens out in the end." 

Summing up the meetings with Beer- 
ing, Dipak Chowdhury, professor of 
GeoScienccs and faculty senate mem- 
ber said, "I don't know eitactly what 
he (Beering) said, I wish he had spo- 
ken exactly on the new Management 
Agreement and then allowed us to ask 
questions. I'm disappointed." 




Purdue University President Beering defended and evaded questions 
from the faculty during the open forum Monday. More photos and

University police advise, warn students 



By Krislie Schlundt, 
Staff Writer 

Lorcn DenHartog. IPFW Chief of 
University Police, tells IPFW students 
about the three on-going safely and 
security concerns for campus po- 
lice: 

I) motorists who fail to yield the right 
of way to pedestrians. 2) motorists 
who illegally pass to the left of south- 
bound traffic delayed at the automatic 
signal at the intersection of West 
Campus Drive and Coliseum Boule- 
vard, and 3) paid-parking pcnnit hold- 
ers who continue to park their cars in 
metered parking zones. 

DenHartog reminds all students and 
faculty that the university police 
"can't bo everywhere at once. We 
aecd your help." DenHartog empha- 
sizes, "This is your campus. Any- 
thing you sec, rcpon il. If something 
happens to you, report it to us." 

DenHartog corrunenLs on Stephanie 
Kahrhoff 's Iciicr (The Communicator. 



3/25 issue) regard- 
ing a careless driver 
who Kahrhoff 

claimed nearly hit 
her and another 
pedestrian as they 
walked toward a

"That student ad-

serious problem on 
this campus."

Director wins 
two awards 

By Jo Ann Stelnforth 
Staff Writer 

Two 1993 Cenificaic of Merit Ad- 
vertising Awards have been awarded 
to IPFW by Admissions Marketing 
Report, the national newspaper of ad- 
missions marketing. Creator of these 
ads is Judy M. Clinton, executive di- 
rector of University Relations. 

The ad series, "Where Experts 
Teach." which spotlighted Ann Marie 
LcBlanc, associate professor of Fine 
Arts, won in the category of Maga- 
zine/Single in the "Welcome to Fort 
Wa)Tic Magazine," 

IPFW also won in the category of 
Magazine/Series for an ad placed in 
the Fort Wayne Philharmonic pro- 
grams. These ads illustrated the schol- 
arly and teaching excellence of IPFW 
faculty. The ads appeared in local 
newspapers and magazines. 

'The concept for these ads devel- 
oped over a period of lime. I felt the 
need to do more to highlight the ex- 
ceptional quality of our faculty and 
their programs," stated Clinton. 

She created the ads, wrote the copy 
and was assisted by the graphic art 
and photographic departmenis of 
the News Bureau and Publications 
as well as the Learning Resource 
Center. This year 1,400 entries 
were submitted. 

Faculty members that have been, or 
will be featured in the ads include: 
Lowell W. Beineke. mathematical sci- 
ences; Mary Helen Thuenie, English 
and linguistics; Arm Marie LcBlanc, 
fine arts; Louis Cantor, history. Linda 
L. Graham, nursing; C. James Owen, 
public and environmental a/fairs; 
Muhammad H. Rashid, engineering; 
Thomas S, Laverghetta, electrical en- 
gineering technology; Kathleen M. 
Rassuli, management and marketing; 
and James O. Fartow, geoscienccs. 



Finally, DenHartog says that paid- 
parking permit holders continue to 
park their cars in the metered zones, 
which arc parking areas reserved for 
campus visitors. And to those who 
remove their paid-parking tags from 
their rcar-vicw mirrors when parking 
at a meter, DenHartog says that the 
imiversity police may catch you, 
neverihelcss, 

"We check all the license plates, re- 
gardless , , - when we have lime." 
The fine for parking in the wrong area 
of the IPFW campus is SIO.OO, which 
is quintuple last year's fine, but illegal 
parking continues to occur regularly. 

"What is a visitor supposed to do if 
all the meter parking areas are full? 
That person will probably park in a 
paid-parking area and get a ticket for 
illegal parking." DenHartog smiles, 
shakes his head, and adds, "What a 
way to welcome visitors to your 
campus." 



Forensics team attends tneet 



Uy Michael Bass 
Staff writer 

The IPFW Forensics team, com- 
posed of six Students, travelled to 
Bloomsburg Slate University, in 
Btoomsburg Pennsylvania for the 
National Forensics Association's Na- 
tional Individual Events Tournament 
on Wednesday. The team will stay 
and compete for five days. 

On Monday, Apr, 19 the team will 
return to IPFW. Coach Keith Murphy 
left early to give the team some prac- 
tice lime before the events begin. 

Events range from three categories; 
Public Address which includes topics 
such as Informative and Persuasive 
speaking; Limited Prep events which 
includes Extemporaneous and Im- 
promptu speaking; and Oral Inieipre- 
taiion which includes poetry and dra- 
matic duo. The IPFW team can com- 
pete in all nine competitive events. 

Jerry Fligcr, a communications ma- 
jor, qualified in all nine events at the 
toumameni. 

Last year Fliger advanced to the 
quarter-finals before being climi- 



Thc rest of ihc team is made up of 
smdenis who are in their first year in 
forensics. 

Angie Neilands. a freshman, quali- 
fied at the Ohio Slate tournament in 
two events; persuasive speaking and 
prose. She qualified for the tourna- 
ment by taking fifth and sixth, re- 
spectively. 

"I spent a lot of hours in the li- 
braiy," said Neilands, "It takes a lot 
of dedication, and you have to be 
willing to give up a lot of time." 

Others who qualified for the tour- 
nament were; Carolyn Pio is compet- 
ing in four events; Teresa Woods 
qualified for three events; Krislie 
Smith and Todd Wakiel both quali- 
fied in one event. 

Although the tournament marks the 
end of the year, both Murphy and 
Assistant coach Gina Kostoff are ea- 
ger 10 hear from more students inter- 
ested in joining the Forensics team. 

"You don't have to be a Communi- 
cations major to take part." said

Campus needs spirit 



Commuier campuses arc so con- 
venicni: we drive in, go lo Qlasn. 
drive out, go home or go lo work. 
Maybe wc decide lo siay and study 
awhile ai the library, have lunch ai 
[he cafeteria, or watch some T.V. in 
one or the lounges. 

This routine goes on for two, 
four, or more years ai IPFW. 
Though wc are the fifih largest uni- 
vcrsily in Indiana, our world is re- 
ally quite limited and siTmli. After a 
time, college life here doesn't real- 
ly seem lo be what we had hoped 
for. 

However, students who attend re- 
gional campuses arc serious, hard- 
working folks who have decided to 
flitcnd the dormless. spartan-like 
colleges mainly for economic rea- 
sons. Expensive residential hous- 
ing, available at main campuses, 
doesn't fn our budgets. 

Others are unable lo leave our 
families — children, spouses.cic. — 
for a great length of lime, IPPiV 
fits the needs of these Fori Wayne 
arcarcsidcnis quite well. 

For all the convenience and the 
minimum costs, something is lack- 
ing at our regional campus: school 
spirii. 

IPFW offers a great variety of ex- 
cellent programs, such as sports 
events, lectures, theatrical perfor- 
mances, and concerts. But, do 
many of us attend? 

Members of student govemmeni 
are hard-working individuals who 
very ably represent and defend the 
student body. But often ihey must 
ask themselves, where is student 
panicipation? ' 

ru fans have their Hoosicn; Pur- 
due people their Boilermakers. 
Though we at IPFW are cither In- 
diana University or Purdue stu- 
dents, wc do not enacily feel like 



we are one of ihcm. Bui. then, we 
should not have to depend on 
schools several hundred miles 
away to be objects of our 
allegiance. 

Actually, we do have an imagina- 
tive and unique mascot. We have 
the Mastodon, a true native to this 
northern Indiana area whose re- 
mains are displayed in Keltlcr hall. 
(No IPFW student should graduate 
without seeing it!) 

lU has "Hoosicr Hysteria." We, a 
group of students have discovered, 
an exhibit "Mastodon Madness." 
Concerned about the lack of school 
spirit, these enthusiastic folks have 
decided to organize events around 
this theme to include all of the stu- 
dents, to promote a sense of unity 
at IPFW. 

On Friday, April 16. the United 
Campus Organization will cele- 
brate "Mastadon Madness" by 
sponsoring an open co-ed volley- 
ball tournament, a hog roast, and a 
dance to bring students together 
and acquaint us with the possibility 
of become a more cohesive, in- 
volved IPFW family. The student 
body has the chance to truly be- 
come one body. 

No one will be excluded; all arc 
welcome, regardless of interest in 
sports, or field of study. 

Wc have seen how student in- 
volvement at the April 5 peace 
march made an impression on both 
Purdue president Steven Beering 
and the local press. They have seen 
thai there are ipdccd people, stu- 
dents as well as faculty, who will 
defend the welfare of IPF\V. 

"Mastodon Madness:" let's find 
out what its all about and pick up 
the spirii and pride of becoming a 
future IPFW graduate. 




You didn't 

hear it 

from me, 

but... 



By F.L. Douse 
Copy Editor 

You didn't hear it from me, but... 
I heard that Chancellor Joanne B. 
Laniz is the only person who decides 
the allocation of the student tees be- 
tween the student govemmeni and 
adilcdc center. 

Now, I ain't one to lalk but we all 
know the reports of the euiTx:nt divi- 
sion of 50/50 split of snjdcnl fees is 
going to change to 60/40 in favor of 
ihe athletic center. From talking to 
students, I can ice that ihcy arc not in 
support of this little arrangement In 
other words, studcnU arc piucd off. 

The solution: The only thing I can 
think of is to file a complaint directly 
to the chancellor, herself. By the 
way. here's her phone number, 481- 
6103. 

Now, let's talk about the advisors 
on campus. It's been brought lo my 
attention that some of the counselors 
arc signing some minority students 
into classes which require prerequi- 
sites and they do not have ihem. 
These students end up dropping out 
of the classes without getting a re- 
fund because they missed the dead- 
line nymg to stay in a class they are 
not ready to take. 

The solution: You. the advisors, 
need to take a hide bit more lime out 
and make sure that each and every 
student is getting the required aiien- 
liem ihey need in furthering their edu- 
cation here ai IPFW (1 personally 
haven't had a problem wiih the advi- 
sors here smce I switched (rom Edu- 
cation u) Arts and Sciences.) 

A student would like a SPEA secre- 
tary to moke an attitude adJusHneDt 
for being totally unprofessional in 
helping her She would also like lo 
applaud C,S Sicinhaus for being so 
kind. 

It you didn't hwr about it earlier 
this •*,ttk. you'rr going to hc*r about 
it nowl A house cleaiving took place 
in our siudcni govenunent. Several 
student senators uete sent Impcach- 
meni leiiers (reminds you of the 
Maris Snyder daysl) because of iheir 
lack of attendance. Instead of gelling 
kicked out, several siudeni senators 
resigned not al!o\king Iniemal Affairs 
to get rid of Ui em. 

It was also rcponcd that the sena- 
tors could be absent from meetings 
because of school and its extra bag- 




gage. However, I guess the chairmen 
of this commiliec feel different about 
homework now. My question is why 
was it acceptable for one of ihc chair- 
men of the Iniemal Aftoirs Commit- 
tee 10 be allowed to miss meetings 
for work? Double standard? I 
don't know. 1 ain't one to lalk. 

Did you know thai several Punluc 
administrators are very appalled with 
die way Purdue University is treating 
this campus. And the reason why 
they have noi come forth with their 
complaints is because ot the iron-fist- 
ed approach Purdue has over ihem. 
this ain't Russial You see, it is Presi- 
dent Beering who decides who stays 
on the payroll or not. So, if you want 
to get paid, you keep your mouth 
shuL 

The editorial staff would like to 
give a standing ovation to Professor 
jeske. his subcomniiliec, and Profes- 
sor Smulkstys (for his courage) in 
preparing a formal public reply lo 
President Beering and his aiiempi to 
push IPFW faculty into becoming 
Purdue slaves. 

According to my source at the 
meeting, the idea of turning lU facul- 
ty into Purdue faculty was jusi a lypo 
( sounds like a lie to me!) I diinlc Raj 
said it correctly. "If Beering makes 
this kind of lypo. dian maybe we bet- 
ter be the ones managing Purdue's 
budget!" 

President Beering, believe it or noi 
., .some Purdue faculty hove ex- 
pressed a desire to become !U em- 
ployees. Why? because diey feel ihai 
lU profs get more respect from their 
academic afTdiation than the PU af- 
filiated profs, I gucsi ihe 20t more 
in retirement benefits don't mean as 
much as getting some respect from 
some Purdue faculty, 

A female student in Dental Educa- 
tion would like for all of the non- 
handicapped students to know that 
she is lick and tired of you using the 
automatic door openers to enter and 
exit out of buildings. What, are you 
saving energy to work out in the ath- 
letic center- You go. girlfriend! 

Well, I guess it's time to wrap 
things up. Just remember, if diere is 
any news or reports going around, re- 
member, you didn't hear it from me! 




Letters to the editor 

History (department shouM keep Kyrou 



To the Editor: 

A huge travesty of justice is about to 
take place here at IPFW. An act so 
evil and devious, even the best horror 
novels would pale by comparison, A 
verdict that has been sent down from 
die highest command within the His- 
tory department that not only effects 
one man but you the student as well. 
What is this Evil about to befall 
IPFW?? Simply, die decision NOT to 
hire Alex Kvro\i backm 

Alex Kyrou is everything good a 
professor should be!! He has a style of 
teaching that not only leads to ex- 
treme understanding of Ancient cul- 
tures, such as the Ottomans and the 
Byzantines, but he makes learning 
fun. Ata.lime when most professors 
are monotone. Alex (literally) baiks. 
He is the type of professor that when 
we the students get to grade die teach- 
ers, you have nodiing but the highest 
regards for him. Many times you want 



lo see whal he is leaching next semes- 
ter so you can have him again. Alex 
Kyrou SHOULD gel the job! ! ! 

I know of whai I speak. Fall semes- 
ter three years ago, on a Monday at 
10:00 a man walked into my H106 
class introduced himself as Professor 
Snead and proclaimed he was teach- 
ing CThemistry 101. Wc looked at our 
pink slips wondering where our H106 
class really was and then, right before 
our eyes. Professor Snead turned into 
Alex Kyrou! 

This was my first class at IPFW and 
it was also Alex's, Since then I have 
been in EVERY new class Alex has 
taught. Plus he and I have become 
very good friends.. Yes, friends with a 
!cachi;r. That is one of the okccHent 
qualities Alex Kyrou has, a quality the.- 
6 tu dents of IPFW should not have to 
be without!! Do You Hear Me Dr. 
Blumenshine!!!! 

Another outstanding quality Alex 



has, that most professors only dream 
about, is his ability to positively influ- 
ence his students. 1 was a business 
major until I had experienced a se- 
mester in Alex's classroom. He 
caused me to understand that it is his 
love for history that gives him the sai- 
isfacuon in his job. Therefore, always 
enjoying his classes and seeing his 
compassion for teaching, I completely 
changed my major to Hi story /Educa- 
tion Ijecausc of Alex Kyrou. Did you 
hear that you people in power? Isn't 
this a goal of educaiors? To instill in 
students your passion for teaching. 
Alex Kyrou is a GREAT teacher!!! 

How can a professor, a man who 
loves his job, be rejected for a posi- 
tion thai is suited lo'a T for him? Alex 
has invented two classes here at IPFW . 
that have never been taught here be- 
fore. Bodi classes, as with ail of his 
classes, are filled each semester. Alex 
is always one of the most regarded 



teachers on campus by the students 
view point and from his peers. Alex 

just completed his Doctoral DiKsena- 
lion and has five articles in pfint in 
just three years of leaching. Docs this 
sound like a man who should not be 
kept on faculty at IPFW? Did \ men- 
tion he is an IPFW alumnus? '^es, he 
went here for God's sake. Have you 
people ever heard of promoting from 
within? How more within can you 
get? Alex Kyrou is the ONLy man 
for the job!!! 

Please help keep Alex on staff here 
at IPFW, Call the History Dcpi. at 
481-6686 and protest the hiring, of 
(the. other, guy who docs NOT deserve 
to be on,|hc same page as Alex). It is 
your education and your Money!! 
KEEP KYROU!!!

IPFW Student 



Students, faculty circulate protest petition 



Addressed to: 
Dr. Joanne B. Laniz, 

Chancellor of IPFW 
Dr. David A. McCants. Vice 

Chancellor for Academic Affairs 
Dr. Marian K. Zimmerraan, 

Dean of Students 
Dr.DavidJ.COK. 

Dean of Ans and Sciences 
Dr. Gary B. Blumenshine. 

Chairperson of History Depart. 
We the undenigncd IPFW students 
hereby protest the History Depart- 
ment's recent faculty hiring decision 
which, if left uncorrected, will lead to 
the loss of an outstanding teaching. 
Professor Alex Kyrou. We believe the 
potendal loss of Professor Kyrou as a 
member of die History faculty repre- 



sents an ill-considered and unjusdfied 
decision, an outrage which will have 
negative consequences for History 
student morale and enrollment. 

This protest is therefore being 
lodged because we believe the Uni- 
versity has ignored basic snident in- 
terests in this matter; because we feel 
that we have no meaningful voice 
whatsoever in the process of faculty 
evaluation; and because the History 
Department has acted contrary to our 
expressed recommendations regard- 
ing the retention of Professor Kyrou. 

Although we do not presume to di- 
rectly affect the University's deci- 
sions regarding the hiring or dis- 
missal of faculty, we do, however, se- 
riously believe that if our opinions re- 



garding such decisions are solicited 
ihey should not be ignored entirely as 
Ihey blatantly were in this case. 
Moreover, despite the University's 
official assertions of commiimeni to 
leaching excellence and student con- 
cerns, the History Depanmeni's deci- 
sion clearly demonsuatcs a total dis- 
regard for both student interests and 
the value of leaching in the selection 
of faculty. We do not believe that any 
oUicr faculty candidate possesses the 
kind of incomparable devotion to 
teaching and sincere concern for stu- 
dents that Professor Kyrou has con- 
sistently demonstrated. Furthemiore, 
we doubt ihat ^y other faculty candi- 
date possesses the same teaching 
qualirications as Professor Kyrou, 



and wc therefore strongly objpct to 
the History Deparmient's decision to 
replace him with another person. 

If in fact, as it claims, the Universi- 
ty's primary mission is to educate in 
an atmosphere of enlightened critical 
thought and stimulate high academic 
standards wherein the interests and 
development of students are para- 
mount, then its students should not be 
denied ihe benefit of a teacher who 
best embodies these precepts. We 
therefore pctiiion the University lo 
reaffirm its commitment to its own 
principles, and accordingly compel 
Ihe History Department to change its 
decision in diis matter. 



Sharon finally finishes 



By Scott Kellenberger 

Sharon was doing it again, she was 
the kind of person who loved the end 
of a book, but had a difficult lime 
mustering the energy to read page 
one. And when .she was fmishcd, she 
was glad she had read it. Her 5lh 
grade teacher had written on her re- 
port card thai she was "mule-like." 
"She docs extremely well once she 
gels staned," he had writien, "but gct- 
UDg her going is a problem." 

That was 15 years ago. Her friends 
and family had been dealing with 
Sharon's mule-like tendencies all of 
her life, hoping that they would di- 
minish with age. Now she was 25 
years old and ready to graduate from 
college, but she was still having diffi- 
culty "geiung staned." 

When Sharon was a little girl, her 
mother literally had to drag her out of 
bed 10 get her ready for school. Dur- 
ing her childhood, when her parents 
told her that she had to spend Sunday 
afternoon over at the Fiechenberger's 
house (or any number of their friends 
who Sharon didn't know), Sharon 
would grumble and complain — even 
ay. After being firmly belted into the 
back seat, she would sctde down. By 
the lime they were ready to come 
home, she didn't want to leave: she 
was having so much fim. 

Now, in her adult life, things were 
pretiy much the same. Although she 
loved to work at die Fimess Firm, she 
didn't have the power lo get started. 
Her best friend. Marcy, would have to 



plead with her before she would final- 
ly agree lo go, even though Sharon 
thoroughly enjoyed working out, 
Sharon sufTcred from [he plague of 
resting inenia! 

The fact that she had made it 
through high schtjol and college was 
a phenomenon that all those who 
knew her had a hard time explaining. 
How she had ever read a textbook, 
much less written a research paper, no 
one knew. And now it was time for 
graduation. 

"Are you going to commence- 
ment?" people would ask. 

Marcy wanted her to go so dial she 
would have someone to talk to during 
the ceremony. Sharon's mom wanted 
her to go for many reasons, but whai 
she usually said was, "I warn to see 
you get dial degree I paid for." 

"1 really don'i warn to," she would 
reply in her typical mule-like fashion. 

In spite of what she said, it seemed 
to Sharon that commencement w^ a 
fitting ceremony, a final rite of pas- 
sage into the real world, a culmina- 
tion of so much youth, a closing 
chapter in her academic autobiogra- 
phy, a tangible end to so many years 
of thinking and writing and studying 
and cramming. 

"What do you think. Dad?" she 
asked. 

"Sure, I think you should go." he 
said with a curious smile. "After all, 
cotnmenccmeni is for sharin' glory."

Another protest 
Lecturer merits post 



To the Editor: 

In last week's edition of The Com- 
municator, a letter from Doris Dermy 
described her "dismay" concerning 
the decision of die History Depart- 
ment in not retaining I&gt;r. Alcxandros 
Kyrou. Ms. Dermy eloquenUy relat- 
ed the tremendous sense of loss and 
saiiness that is now common in die 
second floor of the Classroom Med- 
ical Building. While only her name 
appeared at the close of the letter, 
her words expressed die sentimenis 
of nearly all the students I know who 
have studied under Dr. Kyrou. The 
decision certainly doesn't reflect die 
sentiments of the students enrolled 
die History Depanmcnt. so whose 
sentiments are reflected by such a 
decision? 

What does diis hiring decision say 
about the value of an IPFW degree? 
Dr. Kyrou is an alumnus of IPFW, 
having gone on to the Bloomington 
campus to complete his Masters and 
Doctoral Degrees. He returned to 
IPFW. spent two years developing 
an Eastern European program thai is 
"ncredibly popular, and yet. he 
wasn't retained? 

Dr. Kyrou is being replaced by a 
professor who has never taught at 
IPFW, and who relatively few here 
know much abouL I don't imend to 
be derisive of Kyrou's mysiery re- 



placement, but I do iniend to discov- 
er why the History Department has 
canceled the American History 
classes that were scheduled to be 
taught by Kyrou's replacement. Is it 
possible that he isn't qualified to 
teach the lower level American His- 
tory courses? Tliese courses are re- 
quired by various departments and 
schools throughout the IPFW cam- 
pus, yet next semester there will be 
one less professor qualified to teach 
them. Does Kyrou's replacement 
have the qualiflcauons and experi- 
ence to teach Ottoman or Byzantine 
History? Approximately how much 
sense does any of this make? Ap- 
proximately none, as far as any of 
the faculty and students I have 
discussed the matter with can 
deiramine. 

A mistake has been made in no 
taining Dr. Kyrou. He is an asset to 
the Department of History. I could 
reiterate Doris Denny's letter, and 
describe die uwnendous abilities of 
Dr. Kyrou, but that has been done. 
What must be done now is to get die 
answers to the questions I have 
raised in dus letter, and to correct die 
mistake diat has been made in not 
making Dr. Kyrou a permanent pan 
of die IPFW faculty.

Child care report not adequate 



By Dcbra Beck 
Staff Writer 

The long awaited repon on ihe child 
care needs aJ ihe IPFW campus was 
released in mid-Maich with tilile no- 
llce and for good reason — it said 
nolhing. 

The responsibiiiiy of (he task force, 
as siaicd in ihcir own report, was lo 
make rccommendaiions for child 
caic. insicad of making any recom- 
mendaUons on child care ihcy simply 
resiaicd facis [hai were previously 
known and discussed. ac^K)mpli^ng 
liule. 

Mr. Phil Davich's siadstics of .6% 
of DTW's siudcm body using ihe fa- 
cility were accuraic, I'm sure, Siaiis- 
llcs need always to be qucsiioned. 
The real truth of those smiistics is thai 
IPFW's proponion of openings ai rhe 
day care center were full. We had uti- 
lised every space wc had been allot- 
ted and even taken over some of 
Parkview's space. With that in nund, 
Ihis siaiisiic also fails to mention the 
hundreds of children of IPFW stu- 
dents and faculty who were on wait- 
ing lists to enter ihc facility. These 
facts alone seem 10 scream of a need 
for quality child care for reluming 
and continuing adult students. 

The only recommendation the task 
force came up with were ways to 
spend the money on reserve from stu- 
dent govcmmcnl. It didn't take many 
meetings to come up with that idea. 
Their responsibility was to make rec- 
ommendations for child care, not 10 
hire someone using students' monies 
10 do what they were supposed 10 do. 

I was one of the people who attend- 
ed the spirited and sparsely attended 
seminars put on by Dr. Borelti. From 
those seminars 1 have come to the 
conclusion that the IPFW adminisua- 
lion has as much concern for the ad- 
ministration claims Purdue has for 
Ihcir needs. Perhaps, it is a lesson 
they learned loo well. 

The task force came to Ihc conclu- 
sion, from their survey, that students 
have been able to find alternative 
care. They came to thai conclusion 
after placing flyers, on campus, and 
gciting a very poor response. 

Anyone with any logic can see that 
was a poor method of finding any in- 
formation. How many women (or 
men for that mailer) do you sec drag- 
ging a six-month old baby to class? It 
would go without saying that if you 
are on campus, and you have chil- 
dren, some one is caring for them; 
Ihcy aren't with you. 

Why did the task force not send let- 
ters to studenLi who wctc using Edu- 
care and also those on the waiting list 
lo sec how their needs were being 
met? That information is and was 
available. 

Still the silent needs of the women 
or men who might return to school 
but need child care to accomplish 
their goals, were never even men- 
tioned, and were never meant to be. 
This campus has more students than 
ii can acconunodaie. There is no in-

Amoco silver has less calories 



By Nathan Somers, 
Sla IT Writer 

Last week, i outlined ihe secrets of 

immonaJity. If you trussed it, you'll 
have to make do with the meager 78 
years allotted to you. However, all 
the temporal engineering in the 
world won't protect you from fatal 
accidents. It is vital, especially with 
immortality within our grasp, to 
heed the warning labels around us. 

Many years ago, before the inven- 
tion of color, there were no warning 
labels on consumer products. Peo- 
ple were always putting their 
tongues in electrical sockets, low- 
ing aerosol cans in fires, and mixing 
paint in their cocktails. The Three 
Stooges films chronicle this sad pe- 
riod of history. Later, after World 
War n. consumers demanded warn- 
ing labels. Thousands of people 
who would have died from eating 
Dippy-Do instead survived to create 
millions of babies. These babies 
grew up to become baby boomers, 
who in turn, produced millions of 
people like me. 1 belong to the gen- 
eration ihat can't find Canada on a 
globe. 



The reason people are so stupid to- 
day is because die barriers of namral 
selection were lifted. With the idiot 
filter gone, millions of babies were 
bom. Now, we the grandchildren of 
ihc stooges, are taking for granted 
the very warning labels which al- 
lowed our existence. I and my love- 
ly assistant, Emily "Emu" Bender. 
have researched some common 
products to find which arc and arc 
NOT safe to drink. 

Lei's Stan with gasoline. If you've 
ever stopped to read the warnings on 
gas pumps, you would know that 
gas can be harmful of fatal if swal- 
lowed. I know, at $1.03 a gallon, 
regular unleaded is cheaper than 
Faygo. Bui if you're still gassing up 
your thermos every morning, it's 
lime to cut the pipeline. To ease ihc 
transition from gasoline to carbonat- 
ed beverages, try drinking Loisa Di- 
et Rooi Beer for a week. It has the 
same heady aroma of Amoco Silver, 
but with haif the calorics. 

Minway Wood Finish is also not to 
be guzzled. Its label siaics, "Keep 
away from children. Contains min- 
eral spirits." Kids just wouldn't 
know how to handle an angry miner- 



al spiriu especially after it had been 
trapped in a wood finish can for six 
years. Fimo Modeling Goop is also 
dangerous. It warns. "Not a toy. Do 
not swallow." Apparcnily, real toys 
arc edible. Ms. Bender also noted 
thai Fimo cats through Styrofoam. 

If you're like mc. and you drive a 
Ford Escort, ihen you enjoy lots of 
quality time with your owner's man- 
ual during engine stalls. I learned. 
in the nick of time, thai baitcry acid 
docs not make a refreshing bever- 
age. Ms. Bender was disappointed 
to learn that her curling iron was noi 
intended to be used while sleeping. 
It's noi surprising that a lot of peo- 
ple give up on warning labels after 
ihcy learn aboul sacrifices such as 
these. 

It's not all bad news, though. For 
example, it's pcrfccily safe to lick a 
Chia Pet. Some other producis 
which do not warn against consump- 
tion arc Murphy's Oil Soap. Turtle 
Wax. Ivory Shampoo, and Wendy's 
Frosiies. Warning or not. I would 
siil! avoid all contaci with Ftosucs. 
In case of accidental contaci, wash 
skin thoroughly with soap and sec a 
doctor.

Kebalia dances at IPFW 



By Nkh/I R. RoRcrs 
Chler Reporter 

Picture ihis: a 29 member dance 
iroupc. called Kebalia. in colorful 
nco-iraditional cosiumcs. performing 
dances from [radiiional West African 
tribal celebrations. 

If you were among those who did 
not attend the April 10 performance 
by the National Dance Troupe from 
Sierra Leone at the aihleiic cenier, 
then all you can do is picture it. 

Foriunaiely. The Communicator was 
there. 

Kebalia, on Ihcit third visit to the 
U.S.. presented a two hour program 
with African linim^, dancers, singers, 
lifcsizcd charciers and motivating 
music. The dances represented as- 
pects of life in Siena Leone, includ- 
ing good harvest, life's milestones, 
the onset of womanhood and the duly 
of calling the spirits to meet. 

The ariLSis were selected from all 
the tribal groups in Sierra Leone, 



which provided a variety of dance 
forms. 

To sec this type of culture in person, 
as opposed to the TV version, is com- 
parable to sniffing the new sccni of 
detergent from the TV screen and 
wearing the clothes ii was washed 
in. ..no comparison. There is no ex- 
ception to the real thing. 

Being there was inclusive and ryth- 
mic. The beat of the drums made the 
audicnc* shake lo the music. 

The climax came when a rainbow- 
colored peacock strutted onsUge in 
rhyihm to the music. The lifc-siicd 
bird danced, laid an egg, hatched it 
and produced a baby bird. 

This production, celebrating the 152 
anniversary of the Amnisiad Revolt, 
was co-sponsored by the African 
Conncciiori, an organi7.aiion bridging 
the U.S. with Africa, and the Black 
Collegian Caucus of IPFW, a snidcni 
organization focused on exploring the 
rich heritage and culture of African 
Americans.

Clinic plans music concert 



IPFW's annual Music Therapy Clin- 
ic Concert will be friday, April 23, at 
7 p.m. in Nctf Recital Hall. Admis- 
sion is free. 

"It's an opponuniiy for our sludcni 
music therapists and clicnts--eilhcr 
those we've worked within our clinic, 
or those we've served at community 
ngcncics--to share what they've 
learned." said Linda M. Wright, di- 
rectory of Music Therapy. 

Clients may share favorite songs or 
ones that Ihcy wrote themselves. 
Some will demonstrate how music 
has helped them improve math or 
speech skills or to reinforce socially 
acceptable behaviors. Music is also 



used as a stimulus to alleviate dcprc; 
sion, Wright said. 

The concert teaches music therapy 
students to put on a production in 
which people with special needs arc 
invoIv«]. 

Added Wright: "Our students are 
gratified because more people Icam 
about what they do and the services 
wc provide." Student clinic directors 
arc Dawn Rogers and Dcnise 
Schwalxrrow.

door, Donations enable the clinic to 
continue to provide its services to the

Slowly, one by one the actors begin 
to show up and prepare themselves 
for rehearsal. However, diis rehearsal 
will be one that they had never in 
mind. 

The set is Oiat of PIT iself. There is 
nothing new about it. Nothing has 
been changed. When you walk into 
the theatre, you feel so comfortable as 
if you're ai home with the music 
playing. The lune of the Muppet 
Show opener was a great effect into 
bnngmg one's childhood memories 
back. At least for those of us who 
grew with Kermit and Miss Piggy. 

Sii Characters in Search of Author 
by Luigi Pirandello, is a play about 
six characters who are searching for 
an author to put their torrid family 
history on stage with them starring as 
themselves. 

The play is filled with several 
scenes of humor especially the play- 
ful verba! interchanges between the 
director and his fundamentals siudeni. 
The most hilarious scene was when 
she lold Larry he was not allowed to 
smoke in the theatre. He replies with 
his own sign-language being the mid- 
dle finger. 

Sarah RcLman pulls off an energetic 



and electrifying performance as the 
daughter in the play. As soon as she 
walks onto the stage, one can see her 
sexual magnetism in the slick bbck 
outfit. One of the most seductive 
scenes is the dance scene at the begin- 
ning of the play between her and die 
leading actor. 

As the siory unfolds wc Icam of hei 
sexual history (working as a prosiiiuic 
in a seamstress shop) and sec her full 
rage of hate for her brother and mixed 
feelings for her mother. 

The mother played by Orcnc Col- 
cord, seemed restrained in all of her 
dialogue. 1 felt she could have put 
more emotion in her lines as she did 
in her excellent facial features where 
she displayed several emotions rang- 



ing from depression to fear, especially 
when she has her incestuous sexual 
realtioiuhip with her son during the 
symbolic and awesome lusl-filled 
dance scene when a character is creat- 
ed. 

The brother is one of the most 
hideous and gruesome characters I 
have ever seen. The actor Tits the 
role. The first time I saw him on stage 
I thought he was just going to be the 
regular static character who says his 
lines the same way each lime. How- 
ever, he shows us this character's 
strong and weak points throughout his 
performance, ending it with a lear- 
jcrldng monolguc at the end.

Environmental geology option 

Department designs new program at IPFW 



B&gt; SgmiR.Rogtn 
Chief Beporttr 

The Geology Dcparimcni has ex- 
panded its bachelor's degree in geolo- 
gy lo include axi option of a B.S. in En- 
vironmcnlal Geology. 

■'It's not a new degree, It's an option 
[o an existing geology degree," said 
Dr. Jack Simderman. chair of the de- 
partment of Geological Sciences and 
■isisiing ptofcssof of Geology. He 
added. "We've had a great number of 
iiudenis get into geology because of 
the inlcicst in thecnvironmcni; mainly 
an iniercst in studying the environment 
and maintaining the environment 

The environmental geology option 
will help sludenls prepare to work as 
professional geologists in areas includ- 
ing walcr supply, waste management, 
geological hazards and engineering ge- 
ology. 

The Geology Department contains 
only five faculty members: Prof. Ar- 
gasi, Prof. Chowdhury, Prof. Farlow. 
Prof. Isiorho and Prof. Sundcrman 
who hove worked since 1991 to orga- 
nize this option, 

■'The option had to be approved by 
the School of Arts and Sciences, the 
Curriculum Committee, Ihc Faculty 
Senate and the vice chancellor." Pro- 
fessor Argflsl explained. "The option is 
a response to a societal need." 

All faculty membere were involved 
in the planning of the option and each 
professor will be teaching various 
courses for Uic option. Courses for the 



Environmental Geology option in- 
clude: environmental and urban geolo- 
gy, geochemistry, geomorphology. 

geophysics and principles of hydrogc- 
ology. 

The Geology Department appears 
confident with the option for IPFW 
students. 

"I'm excited about the whole thing," 
assistant professor of geology, 
Solomon Isiorho commented. "Every- 
thing we (geologists) do is lied to the 
cnvironmenl...the environmental field 
will continue to grow for at least the 
ncm 10 ycar3 and its good for students 
to go into it." 

Professor Argasi explained. "(It's) a 
new emphasis, people are seeking a fu- 
ture in the environment, h's a big area 
for geologists. There's an enormous 
demand for people in this area. Look ai 
the growth in slock market environ- 
ment mediation. In Indiana, there arc 
ihe environmental consulting firms." 

Farlow said. "It's a good idea, sign 
up." 

The deparimcnl emphasized thai 
they'd like to see students get ma.sicre 
in Environmental Geology and work in 
the profession. 

Dr. Isiorho said thai he'd like lo sec 
studenLs, "Solve world problems, get 
into politics to enforce environmental 
policy and go to classrooms to spread 
awareness to ihe young ones." 

"As long as we have human beings 
living, we will have 
problems," Isiorho concluded. 




The GeoSclences faculty are pleased with Ihe new environmental geology option available for students al 
IPFW, From lefl lo right are jack Sunderman, chair of GeoSclences, professor James Farlow, assistant pro- 
fessor Solomon Isiorho. assodale professor Scolt Arga.st, and professor Dipak Chowdhury. Sunderman and

All night stand inspires 
writer to share woes 



By NrozJ Rogers 
Chief Reporter 

II p.m.: I suddenly notice ihc suck- 
iag. liicn hissing noises; il sounds 
strangely like a television whose last 
ctmnnci has gone off the air. 

Occasionally the phone or phones 
ring and everyone looks at each o^cr 
10 see who's going lo go for it. Not 
me lonighil I wonder if they fake at 
[dking phone messages here like I do 
at home. "Sure I'll wriie it down, go 
ahead!" 

12:23 a.m.: I'm lired so I decide to 
lake a turn on tlic Wheel of M.AX. 
NuiriUonl Where the odds suck but 
when you're lired, everything looks 
so good! 

■Did I say thai? 

With "The Wheel" you get to hunt 
for your food while improving your 
eye-hand coordination. The wheel 
must stop ai my selection.. the wheel 



must Slop at my selection... 

12:-)3 a.m.: Ah. finally round 
brownish crackers, square yellowish 
cheese, round fuchiaish meat and a 
shot of your second favorite- second. 
because my first choice was out- par- 
tially carbonated drink; you know, the 
kind that scrapes your ihioai as it 
goes down. 

When is the last lime you saw 
someone clean that machine anyway? 

1:57 a.m.: Now I'm starting to 
wonder, if I t(x&gt;k a roll of sand-leipa- 
per would anyone miss it? 

2:00 ajn.: Now is the time for the 
men to be separated from the sheep, 
for the "wo" to be separated from the 
"men", the passing from the failing 
and the homeless from the homefull. 

People have siaricd vacating like 
tenants in Jeffrey Dahlmcr's building. 

3:07 a.m.: There's no noise. Yea, 
the janitor came and went. He swept 
around me. I thought he spK}kc to me 



but when I tried to respond, he siancd 
talking again and walking away. 

4:25 a.m.: OK. what in the hell am 
I doing here? 

Is my homework that imponant? 

Was that a noise I just heard? 

Do those "blue light special" poles 
really work? 

5:11 a.m.: Considering the time ii 
takcsforsecuriiy loget to your car on 
a why-aren'i-you-home-in-bed win- 
ter's day in frceparkingland when 
your keys are in your car and you 
aren't, how long would it lake for 
them to get to you if you pushed a lit- 
tle square blue button? 

Sometime in the am: I've just real- 
ized thai ( really didn't get a lot done 
but most importantly, I made it 
through. 

The sun's coming up. 

It's going 10 be a good day- for

Lecture, landscapes to entertain 



By Jo Ann Sleinforlh 
SlalT Writer 

■Mark your calendars for Thursday, 
April 20 as the Odyssey Lecture Se- 
ries concludes with Sarah Adams, 
granddaughter of the lale photograph- 
er, Ansel Adams, giving a lecture 
and slide presentation at 7:30 pjn. in 
Neff Recital Hall. 

'Adams has entitled her lecture, 
''American EanJi: Tlic Ptiotographs of 
Ansel Adams" and will be offering a 
olose up perspective on the life of her 
famous grandfadier 

She is the Director of Fme An Pho- 
tography for the Ansel Adams Gal- 
leries in Yosemite National Park and 
Fresno. California. The gallery is the 
oldest fumily-owncd and operated 
business in the National Park system. 

■Her aedits include a B.A. in an his- 
tory from New York University, 



guesi-siudem in Hannover, Gcnnany, 
and lecluring to the University Jour- 
nalism faculty in Moscow, Russia. 

Adams' extensive training in fine an 
photography and management style 
has enabled her to become the logical 
successor in the family business. 

The primary focus of her presenta- 
tion will be on the photographer's 
landscapes. She will also talk about 
his life and development as a photog- 
rapher. 

"The greatest thing I gained from 
Ansel's photographs; how he ex- 
pressed his vision, was the emotional 
experience gained from seeing these 
landscapes, " said Adams. 

What used to be taken for granted, 
now hangs on the walls of her house 
where she spends most of her lime. 
The first image of her grandfather's 
work she remembers is of the Snake 
River in the Teton Mountain Range. 



Adams said. "I think his work is 
beautiful and am pleased lo share his 
ideas and interpret his views on his 
pictures." 

There arc two million annual visi- 
lors 10 the gallery each year, which is 
located in the Yosemite Village Mall. 

In addition to selling Ansel Adams' 
original prints, the gallery and muse- 
um contain a gift siore, which sells 
olher items besides photographs. 
There arc hand crafted items from the 
Southwest; Indian pottery, jewelry 
and regional crafts related to nature. 

She encourages questions and intcr- 
aciion with the audience on the im- 
pact of these photographic images. 

This lecture is presented by the Fort 
Wayne Faculty Senate and the Indi- 
ana-Purdue Student Government As- 
sociation and is free and open to the 
public.

Sarah when she hits on the director is 
die most classic line of ihe play. 
; Michell docs a good job playing the 
director's goffer at the beginning of 
the play. Yet, when watching how he 
acts and speaks toward Larry, one can 
sense the underlying hostility he has 
toward him. 

The director becomes somewhat 
self indulged toward the end, not the 
actor, but, the character as the author 
of the play. When he forces the peo- 
ple to continue to tell their story, the 
play reaches its peak as the brother 
discloses the tragic truth about

Lung Association gives 
incentives to not smoke 



By Jo Ann Slelnfonli 
Staff Writer 

The American Lung Association, in 
cooperation with golf courses 
throughout the state, is offering its 
ninth aruiual Golf Privilege Card. 

For a S35 donation golfers will be 
helping in the Ajnerican Lung Asso- 
ciation's fight against lung disease. 
and will be cndllcd lo a complimenta- 
ry round of golf at each course that 
panieipaics in the program. There are 
130 courses panicipaiing this year, 

Carol Vinncdge, Special Events Co- 
ordinator of the American Lung As- 
sociation, indicated there are 25 
courses within one hour of Fori 
Wayne, These include a few such as 
Deer Track, Crooked Lake and Nor- 
wood Golf Courses. 

Proceeds from ihc golf card will en- 
able the Lung Association to sponsor 
smoking and tobacco education activ- 
ities. "The biggest population of new 
smokers are in the elementary 
through middle schools and ihai is 
where we promote our Tobacco Edu- 
cation Series. Teens who arc caught 
arc encouraged to quit. " Vinncdge 
said. 

Health Fairs are also set up in the 
schools to target that segment of the 
population. The golf card provides 
additional education such as cessation 
clinics, asthma education programs 
for children and support groups for 
lung disease patients. 

"Golf courses that panicipatc in this 



program rccogtuic they are suppon- 
ing a wonhy cause." added Vuinedgc, 

An estimated 45,8 million Ameri- 
cans currently smoke and 1993 siaiis- 
tics provided by the association indi- 
cate that 1.3 million people stop 
smoking each year, representing few- 
er than 10 percent of those who try to 
quit. 

Last year's golf card reached 1.000 
participants locally and will be hon- 
ored from May I through October 31. 
1993. The card is valued ai Sl.OOO In

Volleydons continue streak 



By Jo Ann Stelnforth 
Starr Writer 

IPFW Volleydons arc now consid- 
ered ihc "Bcsi of ihe Resi" aficr a 
grueling ihrcc-houi vicKwy over arch- 
rival Ball Siaic Saturday night, 

"With 12 wins in a row, this means 
ihcy are the bcsi in all but the West- 
ern Conrercncc," according lo 
Robert A. Barrett, NCAA Faculty 
RepreKniaiivc, 

Felipe Ralai racked up 33 kills with 
Lloy Ball scoring 106 assists. 

The 'Dons won three out of five 



matches 14-16, 17-15. 16-15, 8-15. 
15-12. In Monday's News Sentinel, 
Amie Bail recapped the game and the 
outstanding play of Chad Blaichley. 
Blatchtcy came off the bench in game 
five to help bring the team to victory. 
Ball is looking for a way to capture 
this spirit though the entire game. He 
doesn't think the team played hard 
enough for all the games. 

"The focus for this week is to finish 
the regular season as #1. The team 
knows what they have to do to get to 
the Final Four," said Barren. 

The 'Dons will sec MIVA action in 



Ball Sute the weekend of April 23 
and 24. 

"Ball State plays well in their own 
arena and will be hard to bcai," added 
Bantti. 

If Ball Stale has defeated Ohio State 
Wednesday night, it will make the 
■Don's task easier. All IPFW needs 
to do for the first seed in the MIVA 
loumamcni will be lo defeat Ohio 
Slate at OSU Saturday- If Ohio State 
wins, IPFW will have to take them in 
three games. 

The final four will be held May 7 
and 8 at UCLA.

Softball team keeps winning 



By Quentin Speigel 
StalT Writer 

The IPFW women's soHball team 
has learned a lesson every team in 
the conference would like to learn: 
how to win, game after game. 

Tlie team's record now stands 17-2. 
5-0 in conference play. 

The first loss of ihc season came 
from Wmona State College of Min- 
nesota, with the second loss occur- 
ring last week against Saint Francis 
on a questionable roll. That loss 
ended their thirteen game winning 
streak. 

The doublchcadcr against Saint 
Francis was a disappointing split for 
ihe 'Dons since the team outplayed 
their opponent in both games. 



The first game ihc 'Dons outscorcd 
thcij opponents 8-3. ouihitting them 
8-5. 

In the second game, the team ouihit 
Saint Francis 5-2, but lost 2-1, com- 
mitting three errors. 

IPFW stands on top of the confer- 
ence standings with a win percentage 
of -941. 

Ashland, Lewis and Indianapolis 
possessed the same conference 
record of 5-0, but have more than six 
losses each out of conference. 

This week the Lady 'Dons will be 
tested by having to play all three of 
ihcsc conference teams. 

The Great Lakes Valley Conference 
Softball statistics reveal thai IPFW 
is serious in its pursuit of a 
championship. 



The team's batting average is .307. 
sttond in the conference. 

Dawn Freeman ranks second in the 
conference in bailing average at 
.469, 

Angic Quiekery leads IPFWs 
pitching staff wiih 29 strikeouts in 
nine games. 

"We could l&gt;e a better leam than 
whai we should." commented Coach 
Dale VanHouien on his team's suc- 
cess. 

VonHoutcn also explained that his 
team started their games slow, play- 
ing at ihcir opponents level before 
taking control of their game. 

The team may start the games 
slowly, but their record shows a 
quick and effective stan to a poten- 
tial championship season.
