lotso.ooo per year. The only other cost 
will be providing the space for the 
system, he said. 

Worthley said IPFW Is presently in 
the process of selecting equipment for 
the program, and that academic units 
could begin in the fall semester of IMS 
He added, however, this would depend 
on the development of faculty training 
and course majerials. 

The new system will be incorporated 
into the departments of manufac- 
turing, electrical engineering 
technology, industrial technology, 
engineering and possibly computer 
technology. Worthley said Training in 
the system wuH be offered through 
standard universi ly courses- 

The addition of CAD-CAM to the 



already, existing 'AUTOTROLi 
system on campus, Carnaghi said, will 
mean an overall improvement and 
upgrading of computer resources 
Worthley said CAD systems are dif- 
ferent enough, though, that those 
trained on AUTOTROL would require 
additional training. 

The selection of IPFW for housing 
Ihe CAD-CAM institute will be Of- 
ficialry made during the START beard 
of directors meeting March 77. Wor- 
thley said. The system Itself win be 
housed in NeffB4l 

An institute open house Is planned 
for early July. Worthley said, to 
acquaint students and businesses with 
CAD-CAM economic potentials. 

The potential for other projects al 
IPFW could also be significant 
Worthley said the effort of START Is 
now on CAD-CAM.
