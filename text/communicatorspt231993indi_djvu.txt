IPFW alumni board member 
runs for state office next fall 



By Felicia Beechiog, 
Editor in chief 

Fori Wayne naiivt and IPFW 
alumnus John Okcson (B.A. '86), 
hopes to have his name on Ihe ballot 
in the siatcwidc elections next fall. 
As a (irsi step, last Thursday Okc- 
son filed a campaign commiliec 
statcmcnl with Ihe state election 
board. 

Okeson, also a graduate of lUPUI 
law school (J.D.'89). is running for 
Ihe Republican nomination for Ihe 
slalc Clerk of Ihe Supreme Court. 

On this campus, he scrve.s on the 
IPFW Join! Alumni Board as a 
member-at-large and also on Ihe 
Royal 'Dons board. . 

"John serves on ihe lU side of Ihe 
IPFW Joint Alumni Board," said 
Sally Uchlman, secretary for Alum- 
ni Affairs. "We are very pleased to 
have him on the board." 

When asked about his experiences 
al IPFW, Okeson remembers his 
college days wilh a smile. 

"Those were some of the besi 




days," said Okeson. "T coached ju- 
nior high sports while in college. 
The education I received (as a polit- 
ical science major] at IPFW has 
served me well," he added. 

As proof, Okeson explained that 
he was accepted al several law 
schools after graduation. 

"My first choice was lUPUl. be- 
cause I knew that I wanted to stay in 
Indiana," said Okeson. 

That was Ihe first school that ac- 
cepted him and he happily went 



there. His wife, Ellen, also gradu.it- 
ed from lUPUI in occupational thtt- 
apy, but she spent the first two ycJis 
of Ihe program as an undergraduate 
al IPf^'s prc-occupalional therapy 
program. 

John Okeson presently works for 
Ihe Fort Wayne law office of BakL-r 
and Daniels. If elected to the four 
year term, his duties as clerk of ihu 
Supreme Court, would return him 1o 
Ihe Indianapolis area. 

He would be in charge of ihe man- 
agement of all filings for Ihe Indiana 
Supreme Courl, the Court of Ap- 
peals, and Ihe Tax Court. In addi- 
tion, the stale clerk of courts is 
keeper of the rolls of the attorneys 
in Indiana and maintains records un 
each one. 

The slate clerk of the Supreme 
Court is one of a group of eight 
statewide elected officials thai in- 
cludes Ihe superinlendeni of public 
instruction, allomey general, gover- 
nor, lieutenant governor, secretary 
of state, stale auditor, and stale ircLi- 



Police release upcoming news 



By Krislie SchlundU 
Staff Wri&lt;er 

University Police Public Relations 
Officer David Reinbold and Securi- 
ty Officer Sonja Tompkins anlici- 
pale "a much bigger year" for this 
year's Alcohol-Safety Awareness 
Week. Events are scheduled from 
Monday, October 18 through Friday, 
October 22 and arc open to Ihe en- 
tire community of Fort Wayne and 
surrounding areas. 

The Student Activities Board 
plans lo kick off events on Monday. 
October 18 wilh a mockiail party in 
the lower level of Kettler Hall. A 
schedule of the week's events will 
be available there. 

Among Ihe many interesting 
demonstrations planned for Ihe 
week, a mock accident involving a 
"drunk" driver will occur in a park- 
ing lot al Ihe Gates Sports Center on 
T\iesday, October 19. 

"It is very realistic," said Rein- 
bold. "They will demonstrate Ihe 
jaws of life, and the Samaritan heli- 
copter will be there, loo -- everyone 
will be there," Reinbold explained. 

On Thursday, October 21. a mock 
trial will settle the mailer of Ihe 




mock accident. An actual judge, ju- 
ry, and prosecuting and defense at- 
torneys will demonstrate the legal 
aftermath of a drunk driving ucci- 
dent. 

On Wednesday, October 20, the 
Fort Wayne Police DcparlmenI 
(F.W.P.D.) will host a demonstration 
of narcotic searches, attacks -■ and 
even friendship — involving the dc- 
parlmcnl's K-9 officers. 

To mention jusl a few more of Ihe 
many events scheduled for Ihe 



week: the F.W.P.D. Emergency Ser- 
vice Team will be repelling off the 
parking garage for S hours one day^ 
Quorum-Per.sonal Attack Alarms 
will demonstrate its wares; John 
Moreno of the F.W.PD. will show 
off his Chevy 2 drag racer (which 
looks like a squad car); and Vince 
and Larry. Ihe crash-test dummies, 
will be on hand to entertain as well 
as educate. 

Raiher Ihan the lectures and 
movies on safely awareness thai 
were scheduled last year, a tent will 
be set up on the mall thai stretches 
from the Helmke Library lo Gales 
Sports Center beside the river. Area 
sponsors plan to man booths that 
will feature tabletop and model dis- 
plays. 

The formal of the event has 
changed this year because the uni- 
versity police recognize that "after 
silting in class all day, the last thing 
a student wants to do is sit through 
another lecture," said Reinbold. 

"And, we promise ihat the pictures 
of fatal accidents will not be 'strate- 
gically' placed in front of the cafe- 
teria this year. Oh, did we ever hear 
about that!" laughed Reinbold and 
Tompkins. 



Senators vote against free period change 



By Felicia Becching, 
Editor in chief 

Sludeni senate met on Monday lo 
discuss several campus issues. Fac- 
ulty senate sent a suggestion lo 
change the free period for activities 
and meetings from the current Mon- 
days at noon lo 3-4:15 p.m. on the 
same day. 

"Thai's not a good lime," said 
Senalor Kevin Allen, 

The feeling of Ihe rest of the sena- 
lors was in agreement wilh Allen's 
commenis. Others thought that since 
the free period works well now, 
there is no point in changing it. An- 
other senalor said Ihat the noontime 
free period is easily accessible to 
both morning and afternoon slu- 
denls. 

In other business, the senate dis- 
cussed publishing a new student di- 
rectory in a bound formal and the 
campus calendar in a calendar for- 
mal. 

In new business, student senate 
passed a bill to provide funding for 



a gift 10 the new child care referral 
center in the Center for Women and 
Returning Adults. 

"Many mothers bring their small 
children into Ihe center, ll's a small 
area," said Rajal Suri. sludcnl body 
president. 

He and Vice President of Finance 
Michael Hcil recommended donat- 
ing S60 for a play center complele 
with a desk, toys, and drawing and 
coloring supplies. 

The bill passed the senate unani- 
mously. 

In other new business, the senate 
decided that the investigative pow- 
ers of the Internal Affairs committee 
needs lo be reviewed in lighl of the 
situation last week with Elbert Web- 
ster's election lo judicial courl and 
consequential removal. 

Writlcn by Internal Affairs co- 
chair Maik King, his bill suggested 
lo make Internal Affairs the prose- 
cuting body for impeachment pro- 
ceedings and be able to review any 
and all financial records, expense 
records, budgets, time cards, and at- 



tendance for SAB, senate, or execu- 
tive branch meeiings. 

Heii said that Ihe SAB budgei 
Ihrough Greg Calien's office is not 
available to IPSGA members. 

Marian Zimmerman, Dean of Stu- 
dents, also said that sludeni confi- 
dcnliality would be violated if some 
financial records, such as lime 
cards, were made available lo ihe 
Inlernal Affairs commillee. 

King himself said thai although he 
wrote Ihc bill, he recommended ihai 
Ihe bill be struck down and thai 
amendmenis be made to the IPSGA 
Constitution instead. 

Five sludeni senators voted against 
Ihe bill and one senator abstained. 

The senators did approve a bill for 
Internal Affairs that requires two 
chairs as a safeguard for possible in- 
vestigations of wrongdoing and that 
a chair cannot be removed while be- 
ing investigated unless I wo- thirds of 
the voting senators approve it. If ap- 
proved, then Ihe chair will be tem- 
porarily suspended from the posi- 
tion of Inlcrn.il Affairs chair.

year. September 17 Ihrough Octo- 
ber 18, is set aside lo lake a closer 
look al the unique and diverse His- 
panic cultures, many of which arc 
represented at IPFW. 

Hispanic Heritage Month offers a 
variety of interesting and educa- 
tional events in which people of all 
ethnic backgrounds can learn and 
enjoy. 

The aclivilies, sponsored by the 
Office of Mullicultural Services 
and, specifically Hispanos Unidos 
(Hispanics United), are intended lo 
educate not only students, but fac- 
ulty members and Ihe IPFW com- 
munity. 

Included in Ihe activtiics is an art 
exhibit of artifacts from Hispanic 



cultures. The exhibit will be in 
Walb Memorial Union throughout 
Ihe month of September, along with 
documentaries and films. 

Hispanic Heritage Month features

IPFW professors. Dr. Richard 
Johnson, Dr. William Klemme and 
Dr. Linda Fox. 

Refreshments and books will be

ticipate in Ihe literature studies. 

Another exciting event are the 
dances that will be performed by 
Pascual Olivera and Angela del 
Mora in Neff Recilal Hall on Satur- 
day, September 25 al 7:30 p.m. 
These dances will range from clas- 
sical and folk to llamenco. Tickets 
can be purchased from Multicultur-

A portion of Ihe money from ihe 
dance-a-lhon will go for Amigos dc 



los Hispanos Student Scholarships. 
The remainder of the money will

ence in Chicago, in October.

ning to go, but anyone interested

many events offered. 

"1 hope that the activities can 
bring a variely of audiences, in- 
cluding students, as well as faculty, 
staff, and the entire community {to

of Mullicultural Services. 

"Its a greai way lo inleraci. I hope 
thai everyone is able lo discover

Teen parents helped by grant 



By Jo Ann Sleinforth, 
Features Editor 

Mark Queen, computer support 
staff specialist for Transitional 
Studies received a S650 grant this 
summer lo serve as a mentor and lo 
leach computer skills lo teen par- 
ents. 

Indiana Consortium for Volunteer 
Service awarded Ihe granl lo 
Queen. About one year ago, he be- 
came aware of the Indiana Consor- 
tium when he read about the grant 
money available from an article in 
The Communicator. 

He contacted Gregory L. Callcn, 
director, student aclivilies, William 
G. Frederick, associate professor in 
Ihc computer science department 
and Mary Ball BranI, student em- 
ployment coordinator, all affiliated 
wilh the consortium. 

Wilh the information obtained by 
them, he was able lo outline his 
grant proposal. The process look 
about a year 

As a microcomputer support spe- 
cialist, his job is lo show people 
how lo get in and out of computers. 
Lab lime is usually reserved in ad- 
vance, with the exception of a two 
hour block on Wednesday and Fri- 
days Queen was looking for a way 
to nil up this space. 

"There were several groups that 
could benefit from this granl, the 
hard part was deciding which one 
to pick," .said Queen. 

Michael F. O'Hear, director of 
Transiiional Studies, knew Juanila 
Mendehall, a teacher al South Side 
High School and heads the Young 
Parents Enrichment Program 
(YPEP).. which was the program 
that was chosen. 

The criteria was that all teen par- 
ents (or soon to be teen parents) 
had lo be from Ihe Fort Wayne 
Community School system. 

About thirty students started the 
program, bul an average of 18 usu- 



ally showed up. The program slart- 
ed on July 21, lasting about five 
weeks. There were two groups of 
fiflcen each in the Wednesday and 
Friday classes. 

"Our goal was to assist the stu- 
dents and keep them in school," 
said Queen. "They generally don't 
have good time management 
skills," he added. 




He associated himself wilh these 
young parents because he was a 
teen age parent at sixteen. He quit 
school in the 70s to raise a family. 

"The YPEP program helps teens 
to overcome the stigma of being a 
parent between the ages of 13 to 
18. 

"Most jobs available lo ihem ate 
low-paying, dead-end jobs," said 
Queen. 

The program this summer was 
geared towards writing a resume 
and using a word processor. 

By the end of the session, a teen 
parent had a generic resume focus- 
ing on their skills and abilities and 
each will be able to update it as 
lime goes on. 

While on the IPFW campus, 
YPEP supplied child care, food and 
snacks so Ihe parenLs could concen- 
trate on Iheir word processing 



Queen does not consider himself 
an educator, but a mentor. For Ihe 
leaching aspect, he relied on the 
help of Greg Anderson, Develop- 
mental Skills Specialist; Joni 
Davis, a graduate student in math; 
and Jim Eng, a computer science 
major. 

This team of IPFW students along 
with Anderson had worked in Tra- 
ditional Studies previously as tutors 
and were able lo establish a good 
rapporl with the teens through 
small group interaction and by get- 
ling to know each one individually. 
The leaching ratio was 3-1, 

The program helped expose the 
teens to college life al IPFW and 
also to show them that there could 
be a future, things could work oul. 

Queen feels the program was a 
definite success. He has one parenl 
starting at IPFW in the Fall and one 
parenl registering in the Spring. 

Another parenl got a job using the 
interviewing skills she learned. 
This he measures as his biggest 
success slory. 

Al Ihe end of the course, each 
teenager received a cerlificale of 
completion on resume writing and 
word processing. 

"There was no grades or tests, Ihc 
focus was to learn somelhing, but 
also have fun over Ihe summer," 
said Queen. 

Tliis program came in under bud- 
get, and wilh Ihe money remaining 
he is looking into possibililies of 
working with another teen cenier, 
Ihe Cooper Teen Center. The pro- 
gram is nol finalized as yet, but it 
will have some connection with 
computer training. 

The nexl teen workshop will be 
held sometime in Spring of 1994 
when access to the labs are more 
available. 

"My ultimate goal is to build a 
community service lab, but right 
now we having a spacing prob- 
lem," said Queen,

change them in ourselves.

You didn't hear it from me, but... 




By F. Lane Douse, 
Managing Editor 

Yoti didn't hear it from me, but have 
you ever thought about how many op- 
portunities come in and out of our 
lives. We lake some. Wc skip some. 
Have you ever ihought about how 
many opportunities we have missed 
or given up on? 

1 was jtist thinking about how I 
moved out of my house. I took Ihis 
opporlunily to experience what being 
independent is all aboul. 

It's not that bad. 

Really. 

Okay, I can lell you thai single life is 
lerrible. You come home lo an empty 
apartment every night wiih no one 
ihere, I have lo cook my own meals. 
Do my laundry. Scrub the floors! 

Once in a while 1 would like lo 
come home and find a meal already 
cooked. I guess all of these actions 
would require some type of a relation- 
ship with another person. 

Well, in this lifetime, several oppor- 
tunities are going to come along 
where I will have to decide If I should 
get involved in a relationship at all. 
And 1 wonder which fork of the road I 
will take. 

Will I establish a relationship or 
not? If so, it will get my underwear 
clean, just kidding. 

Accepting and turning down oppor- 
lunities reminds me of this irip I took 
lo Detroit when I was in high school. 
Lei mclcll you about it. 

1 remember, il was a dark, cold night 
with thunderstorm clouds filling the 
sky, wrong story, jusI joking (smile). 

No, I do remember my school had to 

Letter to the Editor 



meet at Northrop 
High School lo caich 
our passenger bus to 
Detroit. I Fcmemt&gt;er 
my DEC A coordina- 
tor telling us lo be 
there by twelve or 
"We're leaving with- 
out you!" 

She was fifteen 
minutes late. 

Needless lo say, the 
bus pulled up late al- 
so. As I stepped onto 
the bus. I heard 
someone yell, 

"Ftcd!" 

I looked up and it was an old friend 
of mine from middle school, named 
Peggy. We were the besl of friends 
back then and could she gossip. She 
wasn'l better than me, but she was 
close. 

Anyway. I walked to ihe back and 
sat with her and some of her female 
friends. I call Ihem the ama^ons be- 
cause Ihey were. Every one of them 
kept trying lo gel lo know me. Now, If 
they were beautiful knockouts sure, 
hut, they weren't even my type. 

I evenlually moved up a couple 
seats in front of Ihcm because 1 was 
tired of the harassment. As 1 was 
walking one said. "Fred, come sit in 
tbe back with us." 

"To what? Gel mauled? I don't think 



Take it from me, they didn't like Ihal 
onebil. 

We arrived to Detroit hours later. We 
were slaying al the Westin which has 




about 70 floors and a 
mall on the main 
level. Big time hotel, 
andIwasonlhe31st 
floor. Talk aboul be- 
ing scared. 

My roommate 
Adam and I were sit- 
ting around, when he 
asked me if I had 
ever tried dip or 
chewing tobacco. 
(Background: Adam 
and 1 never gel along 
with each other until 
our senior year in 
high school. Why? I don't know. I 
guess because wc just really didn't 
want to gel lo know other people. You 
know how freshman high school stu- 
dents are. Anyway, we're friends now 
and that's all that matters.) Adam 
hands me this small Utile package 
aboul Ihe size of a noodle. It was like 
spearmint or something, I just remem- 
ber the mint flavor. Hell, that stuff 
gave me a little buzz and all. 

That was some nasty stuff there. To 
this day, I will never dip again. I don't 
know what guys gel out of it. It's so 
sick and disgusting, spitting tobacco 
juice every where, I can hear some 
jock saying, well, I guess he's not a 
real man. 

Spitting tobacco does noi qualify 
anyone to be a man. 

To make a long story shorl, we raei 
up with these Canadian girls in a 
workshop about self-esleem. And 
Ihey had no problem with their seff- 
esleem. 



The coordinaior of the workshop al- 
lowed one of the girls to stand up and 
tell aboul all of the things she likes lo 
do. In turn, the coordinator had us 
give positive reinforcemenl. Her 
friend yells. "She's a slut!" 

And I'm thinking, what does she 
need enemies for when she has 
friencLs Uke that. 

Now, you're probably wondering, 
where docs the opportunity come inio 
play? 

Adam and 1 went lo the mixer that 
was held near the end of Ihe tight. I 
was in the dance being assaulted by 
Ihe two Amazons as Ihey tried to 
sandwich me on a fasl song. 1 tell you, 
ihaCsnot fun at all. 

After Ihe dance is over, 1 walk over 
lo Adam so we can leave when the 
Canadian gals walk back by. And she 
says to us, "I'm going lo blow you . . . 
a kiss!" 

Talk about gelling someones hopes 
up. 

1 lell you, I just look back at thai and 
think to myself, now, if we wanted to 
be dogs about the whole situation, we 
could have taken them up on their of- 
fer. However, wee just blew it off as 
if it was nolhing. 

But 1 still wonder why we didn't 
lake them up on their offer. 

Maybe we were scared because of 
their straight forwardness? 

Maybe we were just too smart lo fall 
for their trap because we knew Ihcy 
were a bit slutty from the way they 
presented themselves? 

Maybe we were jusI loo smart?

Letter to the Editor 



Student shocked at prof's actions 



Dear Editor. 

I have a problem concerning the 
unprofessional conduct of a depart- 
ment head. A week and a half ago, I 
had to miss a class due to illness. 

The next day of class, I contacted 
this department head, who happens 
to be my professor, to gel the main 
points of the lecture. He then in- 
forms me, and I quote. "Ii is not my 
responsibility to recreate the lecture 
for you." He went on to say, "Un- 
less times have changed, the process 
you would follow would be tq ge( 
the notes from a classmate." Of 
e also was no lack of sar- 



casm in his voice. 

At this point out of frustration, 1 
discontinued the encounter, 1 sal 
thinking later that, true, it wasn't his 
responsibility to come to me. How- 
r, 1 look the responsibility in my 
hands by going to him and asking 
for the main points of the lecture. 

As an education major, I 
en a poor example of what an edu- 
cator should be. 1 have always held 
the ideas that professors arc there to 
help the students in whatever capac- 
ity is needed. 

Docs this attribute change when a 
professor takes the responsibility of 
a department head? 



If so, 1 know I will not aspire to 
gain that position in my career.

Thriller 

provides 

action 

By Jenniftr Murray 
Slaff Writer 

What comes lo mind when you 
think of a Clini Eastwood movie? 
Action packed violence? A loner 
cowboy? Maybe unethical cops that 
tote .44 caliber handguns? 

Whatever it is that comes to mind, 
you can be sure that it's backed by 
lots of slecly-eyed, unspoken atti- 
tude. Right? Well, not so in East- 
wood's new movie. 

Those who are looking for another 
invincible "Go ahead, make my day" 
character, won't find one in East- 
wood's new movie, "In the Line of 
Fire," 

What you will find, however, is a 
rather likeable, finally believable 
character who finds himself facing 

Movie Review 

off against a very ptojiciently clever 
opponent. 

Eastwood pays an aged secret ser- 
vice agent, Frank Horrigan, who's 
engaged in a game of cat and mouse 
with a professional a.ssa&amp;sin hell bent 
on taking out the president. 

The assassin (John Malkovich) ob- 
sessed with including Frank in his 
game, leads him on with taunts of 
his failure to protect President John 
F. Kennedy. 

He also makes reference lo Frank's 
age. Frank's sensitivity surrounding 
his age adds a new angle lo the 
"Clint Eastwood hero." He loses the 
hard edge, yet it becomes easier lo 
relate to this new character. 

Despite a softening of the "macho 
image", he still remains the compe- 
tent "good guy," and he still "gels" 
the girl. The girl, Lilly Raines (Rene 
Russo) is his co-worker who initially 
dismisses him as a suitor. 

However, since Eastwood was ac- 
tually allowed a ccrtian amount of 
chaim in this movie, she eventually 
warms up to his endearing dea- 
monor. 

John Malkovich plays Opposite 
Easlwood and gives an incredible 
performance as Mitch Leary, a one- 
time government operative \ 
beirayed-by-the-service. He seems 
to keep one step ahead of Frank 
Horringan. trailing him along with 
intimate phone calls. 

Directed by Wolfgang Peterson and 
with an excellent cast, "En the Line 
of Fire" is a suspense thriller that 
will keep you charged till the end 
and is surely, in my opinion, a one of 
a kind Clint Eastwood movie.

New sport gains popularity 



[ly Thom Duwson 
Slaff Writer 

Imagine being 45 pounds heavier and 
three to four times wider than your current 
waist size. The forces of nature no longer 
seem to work ihe same as they have before. 

Finding yourself stumbling and careening 
about a large circular mat 14 feet across, 
your feet are no longer taking the steps you 
wanted them lo lake. Jeering, expectant 
faces all around add to the fact thai main- 
taining balance will become an all new 
milestone in your life. 

Not only do you have lo contend with a 
new found sense of gravity, but there is also 
another presence on the mat. One that is 
just as clumsy, as big, and as heavy as you 
are. One that wants to squash the daylights 
out of you. 

It is nol a battle of patience — only a few 
seconds — to see who loses whose footing 
first in order to execute the coup de grace, 
the moment all those leering faces have 
been wailing for, the belly llop finale. 

This is not a bouncer approaching after 
you have had one loo many drinks, nor is it 
a potential mother-in-law after you've told 
het how bad her cooking really is. It is a 
new fad thai has swept into Fort Wayne 
called Sumo Suit Wrestling. 



On weeknjghLs at a few local bars around 
the city, combatants from the crowd volun- 
teer to crawl into a 45 pound foam rubber 
body suit that simulates the experience of 
being one of these fleshy juggernauts. 

After being hoisted upright like some me- 
dieval knight onto his horse just before the 
jousi, the referees strap on the token protec- 
tive helmet, replete with black ponytail, 
and finally padded hand mitts. 

The hopeful gargantuans square off in the 
circular ring until one of ihem can either 
force the other to the ground, or until one 
of Ihe two loses balance. The latter is most 
often the case. Then the triumphant belly 
flop,.,a maneuver unrelated to actual sumo 
wrestling but made popular by American 
wrestling leagues, can be done. The victor 
ultimately is the contestant that can manage 
lo slay on his or her feet long enough to 
win two out of ihree of these matches. 

Inspired by a similar Californian 
wrestling act, Dennis Gasparovic and An- 
thony Davis founded their company Totally 
Fun. and brought the wrestling act lo Fort 
Wayne, 

The activity had proven to be a popular 
pasttimc in California and judging from the 
increasing numbers of onlookers and par- 
ticipants, the activity appears to be gaining 
popularity as well.

Rock musical log: week two 



By Marks. Snyder 
GuesI Wriler 

DAY 7 

When the casi arrives on Ihc re- 
hearsal slage. friendly, if somewhat 
l«s celebraloty grcellngs lake place. 
Slress can be fell in [he iheater. Sens- 
ing this, Diicciot Life — being ihe con- 
summate professional that he is — 
takes a few moments at the start of re- 
hearsal lo rally the cast. He relates to 
us similar experiences of Ihe casi in 
Ihc original Broadway production of 
HA]R (which he worked on), compli- 
mcnls \is, but reminds us Ihat wc musi 
continue lo work hard and enhibil pro- 
fessional discipline as we have far to 

go- 
Spirits buoyed by Director Life's 
words, Ihe cast asked if we mi^l add 
Sundays to our already strenuous re- 
hiarsal schedule. This is the first lime 
I have ever witnessed or heard of any 
cast member asking a Director to add 
weekend rehearsals. Il is an indication 
of. not only the dedication and profes- 
sionalism of this cast, but further 
proof of how very special this play is 
lo everyone. 
DAY 8 

A relaxed and playful cast takes Ihc 
stage to begin warming-up before re- 
hearsal begins. Already "pot bellies" 
and "love handles" are beginning to 
disappear. Even the ubiquitous ciga- 
rette (the performing arts having be- 
come one of Ihe last holdouts against 
the polilically correct "anii-smoking" 
zealolory) is being seen less and less. 

Each rehearsal begins with approJti- 
malely live minutes of sirelching exer- 
cises and light calisthenics, followed 
by vocal warm-ups and concluding 
with diction exercises. And, to think 
that some people pay good money for 
an exercise class.. .nexl time save our 
money and auditions for a musical di- 
rected by Larry L. Life, 
DAY 9 

Tonight is a "music rehearsal." It is 
time to finish learning the remaining 



songs in the last act. Fourteen songs to 
go and wc have committed the entire 
score lo memory. Palience-of-the-year 
award must go lo our music director. 
Cathy Ford. She has, in a brief few 
weeks, successfully taken actors — 
some who could not read music — and 
turned them into singers. 
PAY 10 

The stage is beginning to resemble 
whal it will look like in performance 
as il begins to fill up with props, slage 
dressing, and other scenic elements. 
We have also now seen Ihe designs for 
Ihc costumes we will be wearing, 
speaking of which: imagine designing, 
making Ihe patterns, and then sewing 
from scratch clothing for over 40 casi 
members. 

That is the job of our costumer, Pro- 
fessor Cr^ig Humphrey and his co-de- 
signer Orene Colcord, These two indi- 
viduals along wilh Ihc help of our two 
part-time assislanis, will have de- 
signed and buill full wardrobes for 
over 40 individuals. 

Think of Ihat the next time you gripe 
about having lo sew on a button! 
Meanwhile, our property masler Jon 
Michell and his assistant Sarah Snyder 
are busy designing, building, or 
procuring the props that will be need- 
ed for the show. 

Among other things they have had 
Ihe responsibilities of rolling over 400 
"joints" lo be used at props. Hmmm...I 
wonder where they learned how. 

Besides Ihe props people, musicians, 
music direclor, costume designers, 
slilchers, we also have our slage man- 
ager Marty Kerchival lo thank as well 
as all of Ihe nameless and faceless 



technicians Ihal will operate Ihc sound 
and lighling, paint and build scenery, 
and on and on and on. These are truly 
the un-sung and often overlooked he- 
roes of a Ihcairical production. 
DAY 11 

Midweek and we arc all still stand- 
ing! With each day the muscles be- 
come less sore and more toned. More 
musical numbers to stage and block. 
The show is quickly begiiuiing to lake 
shape as a cohesive whole. 

While Ihere is no slacking oft, casi 
members are again becoming more re- 
laxed and playful as most of the songs 
have been learned. 

We have seemingly and successfully 
learned how to "orgy" — again, certain 
cast members seemed lo need no in- 
slruction — and lonight must learn 
(well at leas! some casi members) how 
to carry placards and march in protest. 

The chani "Hell no, we won't go" is 
lost on some of the younger members 
of the cast who have no recollection of 
Ihe draft. 

In order lo motivate the necessary 
anger thai must accompany Ihis chant, 
I suggested lo one casi member lo 
Ihink of a trip to the Bursars Office or, 
better still, Ihe Financial Aid Office. 
Now. Ihey are properly angry! 
D AY , 13 

Tonight's rehearsal begins with a 
discussion of the 60s. These discus- 
sions make me feel so very old — espe- 
cially being called on to explain who 
flmolhy Leary is and what he repre- 
sented. "Tune-in, lurn-on. and drop- 
out"? Many in Ihe cast have no clue. 



Artistic 
funding 

By Jo Ann Steinforlh 
Features Editor 

The deadline of October 1 is fast 
approaching for arlisis, individuals 
or organizations iniereslcd in being 
funded by the Indiana Arts Corrmiis- 
sion under the Begrant Program. 

The Arts United/IAC Rcgranting 
Program's philosophy is to provide 
fund.s to educational in.stiiuiions, for 
the creation and developmeni of 
programs that further the under- 
standing of the arts in Ihe education- 
al process, 

'"The regrant program receives 
monies from the Indiana Arts Com- 
mission and in lum, gives directly to 
individual ari projects", said Caria 
Nunoz, director of Arts United of 
Greater Fort Wayne. They adminis- 
ter the program. 

S500 grants are available to not- 
for-profit organizations or individual 
artists in Allen, Dekalb. L.agrange, 
Noble and Whitley counties. 

IPFW has been Ihe recipient of 
this program in Ihe pasl. In 1992, 
Ihe school of fine and performing 
arts received SI. 250 for mailing 
costs for their publication, 'The Art 

In 1989, the art department re- 
ceived $500 for Ihe now defunct 
Forte Festival. 

Criteria for evaluation are as fol- 
lows: Artistic quality of the project, 
education outreach and development 
polenllal of the project, importance 
of the project to. the organization or 
individual applying, and ability of 
the applicant to carry oul the pro-

Oakland Invitational 

Volleydons start season slow 



Aaron N. Thompson 
Sports E(]ilor 

On Friday, September 10, Ihe 

Women's Volleyball learn travelled 
to Rochester. Ml to participate in 
Ihc Oakland Inviiaiional. The Vol- 
leydons enlered this tournament 
with a 1-3 record and saw a chance 
foi improvement. 

The first opponent for Ihc Volley- 
dons was Ihe learn from Hillsdale. 
IPFW won Ihree out of four games 
againsi them with Ihc final line be- 
ng 15-8. 11-15, 15-8,15-11. 

Heather Te.igatden was the star of 
the game as she had a career high 
26 kills out of 52 altcmpls. Senior 
captain Jill Lyon had 43 assists, and 
Julie Parroi also had a career high 
in kills with 13. Amy Scheumann 
also contributed in the victory with 
6 kills and 7 assists. 

As a team, the Volleydons had 60 
kills on 146 attempts with 19 errors 
giving Ihe a ,240 percentage for the 
four games. They also had 51 as- 
sists, 9 service aces and 46 digs. 

In the second game, Ihe Volley- 
dons ran into a little bit more trou- 
ble with the host team. Oakland. 
Their record fell to 2-5 as they lost 
in three games, 15-10. 15-12, 15- 
10. 

Once again, the learn was led by 
Heather Teagarden with 16 kills out 
of 42 atiempls, Jill Lyon also led in

non Smith contributed with 5 kills.

ing them a percentage of .180.

sists. Heather Teagarden had trou- 
ble with the defense of Lewis as
