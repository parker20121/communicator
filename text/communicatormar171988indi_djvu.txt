Report reveals 
unclear mission 



By DAVID N. BENSON 
News Editor 

IPFW suffers from a lack of 
direction and serious disagreement 
about where it should be going, 
according to a report commissioned 
by Ihe Greater Fort Wayne Chamber 
of Commerce and Fort Wayne Future, 
The report was conducted by a 
Coopers &amp; Lybrand task force, headed 
by Suzanne H. Woolsey, Woolsey holds 
a Ph,D. in clinical and social 
psychology from Harvard. 

The report, released Feb. 22, says 
IPFW is still evolving, and disa- 
greement exists as to what type of 
institution it should be. Chancellor 
Tom Wallace views IPFW as an urban 
university. lU views IPFW as an 
integral pari of the lU system. Many- 
in the community have no experience 
with IPFW and view the university as 
either second-rate or as a feeder 
school for the main lU and Purdue 
campuses. 

But the report found that IPFW is 
neither second-rate nor a feeder 
campus. According to the report. 94 
percent of IPFW's 10,000 students are 
working toward a degree. Fewer than 
200 students transfer to Bloomington. 
and fewer than 100 transfer to West 
Lafayette, the report said. The report 
also said the practice of transferring 
credits from IPFW to either lU or 



Purdue is very limited. 

The report said IPFW's inability to 
agree on a central mission drained 
enthusiasm for accomplishing any 
mission. Potential donors are 
reluctant to give money because they 
are unsure how their funds will be 
used, the report said. Also, a clear 
mission would determine campus ex- 
pansion. Different facilities would be 
needed for dormitories than for ex- 
panding either the liberal arts or 
engineering programs. 

The report also found that people 
who have attended IPFW are satisfied 
with the quality of education received. 
Businesses recruiting general -business 
talent found general satisfaction and 
enthusiasm in IPFW graduates. 

Nonetheless, the report found dis- 
satisfaction with the quality of IPFW's 
engineering programs. Area corporate 
CEOs viewed IPFWs engineering 
programs as lacking depth, compared 
to Purdue programs. As a result, 
recruiters expressed reluctance to 
hire IPFW graduates to fill their 
companies' more challenging 
positions, the report said. 

Lack of opportunity for an advanced 
engineering degree hurts local 
businesses in their effort to attract 
quality engineers from outside the 
greater Fort Wayne area, the report 
said. 



Senate tables proposal 
to purchase computers 



By MICHAEL DAVIES 
Staff Wrfter 

At the March 2 meeting, the student 
senate held a ten-minute closed door 
discussion, which began at 9 p,m. 
Even though the senate meetings 
normally start at this time. Phil 
Downs, vice president, stated, "It's 
just a group of people gathering for a 
discussion." When the meeting 
started, the senate voted to accept 
Gina Jones as temporary clerk, and to 
table the computer bill. 

After the acceptance of temporary 
clerk was registered, Gina Jones, 
former editor of The Communicator, 
stated to President Kurt Gregory, "I 
know who does the hiring and firing 
around here," When asked how she 
felt about being accepted on a 
temporary basis, she responded, 
"They Ithe senate) shouldn't hire me

offices. The bill was proposed because 
student senators found it increasingly 
difficult to use the school's computers 
because of the increase in the number 
of students using them for homework. 

Issuing dissent on the bill was 
senator Elizabeth Schiueter, who 
stated, "This bill has already been 
introduced and defeated in appropri- 
ations, and only one committee 
member voted for it," She added, "I 
think this is a bogus way to spend 
students' money; if we i senate 
memtjers) can't even go downstairs to 
use a computer then that's pretty 
bad." 

Senator Tim Smith voiced his 
agreement with Schlueter's 
comments. However, senator Carol 
Hildebrand responded. "I think 
something needs to be done to make 
the bookkeeping more convenient; 
paper wrinkles, but discs save," 

Schiueter responded, "If there is no

According to Franke, image is 
important. The perception the sur- 
rounding community has of a uni- 
versity can be very important to what 
the future holds for the campus. An 
advertising push that started more 
than a year ago reflects the direction 



and new situations easily, 

IPFW is now offering over 130 
degree-programs, and a recent ad 
staled, "We learn not for school but 
for hfe," 

"We want to avoid the 'Get a 
degree, and you'll get more money'

"First of all we want to be thought 
of as unique— not a clone of Purdue or 
Indiana and not inferior," commented 
Franke, All of the advertising stresses 
the fact that IPFW is "The 
University" of northeast Indiana. 

Twenty years ago IPFW was a one- 
building institution with less than 1500 
students. Since then it has grown to 
six buildings, with plans for

Evening engineering program 
offers Bachelor of Science 



By SYLVIA LOWDEN 
Staff Writer 

One result of the push on campus 
towards better meeting the needs of 
the evening student is the new evening 
engineering program, scheduled to 
officially begin next fall. It has been 
serving students unofficially for the 
last four years, but now the plan will 
more clearly put course requirements 
into a long-range sequence so students 
will know what lo expect. 

The evening program will cover the 
bachelor of science in engineering 
with either electrical or mechanical 
engineering options. "All departments 
have cooperated," said Kenneth R, 
Johnson, associate professor of 
engineering, who developed the 
eight-year plan. 

The part-lime student population of 
IPFW has increased steadily over the 
years, and this new evening engineer- 



ing program may be a good alterna- 
tive to juggling day and evening 
classes with a full-time job. 

Several different classes have been 
added, and theie has been some 
redistribution of hours in design areas, 
especially in the electrical-engineering 
option. A student taking two classes 
per semester has the potential for 
completing a degree in eight years. 
Students who have already completed 
some of the degree requirements can 
possibly graduate sooner. 

The new program is a response to 
many community requests from 
companies such as Magnavox, ITT 
and even the Greater Fort Wayne 
Chamber of Commerce. Johnson 
commented that with enough demand 
the evening program could become 
entirely separate from the daytime 
engineering program.

Coopers &amp; Lybrand: 
Credible image necessary 



Will someone please make up our 
minds about what the Coopers and 
Lvbrand report really says? 

The News-Sentinel says that the 
report claims Purdue President 
Steven Beering. lU President 
Thomas Ehrlich and IPFW 
Chancellor Thomas Wallace can't 
agree on what IPFW's purpose 
really is. But the News-Sentinel 
goes'on to report that Beering dis- 
agrees; he is reported as saying 
that the three statements equate to, 
"We consider that campus an in- 
tegral part of the lU and Purdue 
systems, with a distinct urban 
mission." 

Beering goes out of his way to 
jjrove the report inaccurate by 
stating that he did not say IPFW is 
a "feeder campus." 

The report never claimed he did. 
The report said thai the uninvolved 
Fort Wayne public saw IPFW as a 
"feeder campus." 

"Mayor Paul Helmke said the 
outsiders' point of view is one of 
the strengths of the report," says 
the News-Sentinel. 

The "outsiders'" view demon- 
strates a need for IPFW's image to 
change The report shows hope. It 
shows a place lo build from, not a 
place to stand atop and point out 



past discrepancies. 

The Indiana Economic Devel- 
opment Council's plan for Fort 
Wayne (and IPFW) to become a 
"center of excellence" may sound 
like a party-line, but at least it's a 
start. 

Whether or not a few credits 
transfer back to a parent university 
is not a concern to the 97% of the 
students who DO NOT transfer to a 
main campus. Less emphasis, 
therefore, should be placed on this 
issue. 

The report found that the "people 
who have attended IPFW report 
general satisfaction with the ed- 
ucation they receive at IPFW." 
This is not surprising, Many stu- 
dents attending this university 
currently are proud of the school- 
ing they are getting. Unfortunately 
it can be hard to be proud of the 
university itself when, as the report 
found, "fPFW is viewed as a 'sec- 
ond class' institution." 

The public image of IPFW needs 
to be improved. It may be a dif- 
ficult task, but it is what IPFW 
needs the most— public credibility 
Local graduates need to seek local 
employment. Ad campaigns need to 
be drawn up. This university needs 
an image. It needs a good image. 



Constitution flawed, laws bent 



... iQUK l^l^sm Mt YMP. SKouLD JoV

At the last student senate meet- 
ing. Kurt Gregory, student body 
president, appointed Gina Jones as 
clerk of the student senate. With 
that accomplishment. Gregory 
could rest easy from his two-montn 
search to fill Inat post, 

There's only one problem: under 
the present constitution, the clerk 
is required to be enrolled in six 
credit hours, Jones has only three 
and is thus constitutionally in- 
eligible to be clerk. 

The Jones incident is only a fore- 
taste of what is to come. This is the 
time of year when the student body 
president is supposed to submit the 
names of five candidates to fill 
election board positions. Gregory 
appears lo have difficulty doing 
this. 

A small portion of the blame 
must fall on Gregory, A larger 
portion can be blamed on the ap- 
athy of IPFW students. Most of the 
blame falls on the document that 
has, by its very design, allowed 
such fiascos to occur: the present 
senale constitution effective, or in- 
effective, since 1982. 

When Gregory was asked why it 
took so long to find a clerk, he 
responded, with a good deal of 
truth, that anyone who wanted to 
be clerk could just as easily be- 
come a senator, a post with more 
prestige. 

Under the constitution, the re- 
quirements for senator and clerk 
are the same: maintain a C aver- 
age and be enrolled in at least six 
ciedit hours, A good idea might be 
to raise the standard so that a 
senator must have nine credits and 
a 2.5 grade point average. Then 
there would be a pool of people 
with GPAs between 2.0 and 2.5 who 
could be a clerk or an election 
board member. Still better would 
be for IPFW students to get in- 
volved, but that cannot be con- 
stitutionally mandated. 

The constitution also calls for 



posts that have not been filled in 
years. 

The senate should abandon the 
provisional court. This organization 
has never been called into session, 
as far as anyone knows. Nor is it 
exactly clear what purpose the or- 
ganization should serve. 

The constitution makes only 
vague references to "judicial mat- 
ters," one of which might be im- 
fieachment. However, the constitu- 
ion decrees that the internal af- 
fairs committee must investigate 
the charges and the senate itself 
serves as the deliberative body; 
this arrangement makes the court 
unnecessary. Why not make this 
the procedure for all judicial mat- 
ters and disband the useless body? 

A more obvious white elephant is 
the senate executive committee. 
The membership of the committee 
is unclear. The constitution savs in 
one place that the committee 
chairs are members; other sections 
suggest that the members are ap- 
pointed by the president. 

The membership of the senate 
executive committee isn't the most 
disturbing question; what is so 
worrisome is the committee's 
function. The writers of the con- 
stitution intended it to handle 
emergency measures that could not 
wait until the next senate meeting. 
This is fine on the surface, but it 
also creates the opportunity for 
secret meetings to be held behind 
closed doors. 

A better solution would be to 
simply call emergency senate 
meetings. Each senator already 
has a mailbox. Requiring the sen- 
ators to check their mailboxes 
every day would make it possible 
to call an emergency meeting on a 
24-hour's notice. An intelligent 
deliberated decision by the entire 
senate is bound to be more rea- 
sonable and democratic than one 
hastily arrived at by a fraction of 
the student body's representatives. 




— Letter 



Compare-and-contrast is not the 

purpose of the Women's Studies programs 



By NATALIE ALCOX 
Managing Editor 

There has been some question 
lately about the importance of a 
women's studies' program on a 
university campus. Some people 
have even referred to women's 
studies as the new "academic 
ghetto." 

Commentary 

Critics who fault a women's 
studies' program hold several 
preconceived notions: women's 
studies encourage women to think 
of themselves as different from 
men. they encourage separatist i- 
deas and they aren't "true" 
classes. 

Fortunately these negative at- 
titudes are not seriously damaeine 
IPFWs Women's Studies' 
program. 

Tliere is no truth to the allegation 
women's studies propagate the no- 
tion women are different from 
men. Women's studies are not 
compare-and-contrast exercises 
Classes are not based on whether 
men or women are right or wrong' 



they are based on reality. 

True, men are different in some 
ways. Classes, however, do not 
focus on these differences. 

Women's studies' classes also do 
not encourage anyone to "sepa- 
rate" or break away from the 
mainstream of society. Students 
studying women in psychology, 
women in history and women in 
american politics do not claim that 
women were the only ones who 
contributed to these areas; they 
merely examine women's often 
overlooked contributions in these 
areas. 

Women's studies' classes are 
taught by professors; tests are 
given and grades are received, as 
in any other classes. Women's 
studies' courses are not in a 
"ghetto" but are part of a highly- 
specialized field. 

Women, of course, are not the 
only ones who may take women's 
studies' courses. Men who have not 
been exposed to the contributions 
women have made politically so- 
cially, psychologically and histori- 
cally should consider taking one or 
more women's studies' courses 



To Ihe Kdllor 

The only thing "contorted 
and distorted" about 
Purdue Indiana Theatre's 
recent production of "A- 
luminum Paradise" by Joel 
K Murray was the review 
published in "The Commu- 
nicator." I hesitate to in- 
clude "irresponsible" in the 
list because Uie reviewer. 
however misguided, at least 
attempted lo come to terms 
with the play, 

"Aluminum Paradise." 1 
concur, is not an easy, 
pleasant, pretty diversion, 
it requires its audience to 
struggle with nol only (he 
words and actions per- 
formed on the stage but 
also to struggle to come to 
terms with their own 
myths, self delusions and 
expectations. 

"Aluminum Paradise " 
forces us to explore how we 
view the dream and the 
reality of family life, the 
per\'asiveness of TV-speak 
(not unlike the Newspeak in 
Onvell's "1984"! and TV 
images as icons and stereo- 
types of modem life, and 
the conventions of conven- 
tional (and so very, very 
safe) theatre. 

How often has each of us 
wished we could edit our 
lives lo cut out the bad 
parts, the messy parts, the 
hurtful parts to present a 
pristine, polished, and per- 
fect vision of who and what 
we are lo ourselves and to 
others? I think the answer 
IS very often, whether we 
are willing lo acknowledge 
it or not 

Editing real life to fit the 
fantasies of reel life be- 
comes one of Ihe driving 
forces Iwhind the l&gt;ehavior 
of Jake, the main charac- 
ter, portrayed with great 
power by Michael Bowman. 
At the top of the play, Jake 
comes across as a comic 
buffoon, albeit a strange 
and violent one, not unlike 
the "wacky next-door 
neighbor" character often 
referred to in the play and a 
staple of TV situation- 
comedies. 

But litUe by tilUe. or to 
employ Murray's television 
metaphor, frame by frame 
and take by take, Jake is 
revealed to us as a complex 
man of insight and sen- 
sitivity, one who is tor- 



mented (not unlike 
Sisyphus, who was con- 
demned by Zeus to push a 
rock up a steep hill for 
eternity, thus never reach- 
ing his goal) by frustration 
and bitter disappointment. 

By poking and prodding 
his real/reel families (as 
well as Ihe audience), even 
torturing them physically 
and emotionally. Jake (and 
Murray) deliberately break 
the most basic contract be- 
tween play/performer and 
audience /viewer: the will- 
ing suspension of disbelief. 

When we walk into a 
theatre, we subconsciously 
tell ourselves that we will 
pretend that what we are 
experiencing is real. We 
will willingly forget that 
there is that invisible 
"fourth wall" shielding us 
from the action on stage, 

Murray and set designer 
Steven T Sarratorre 
cleverly distort the imag- 
ined "reality" we expect 
from a play and its setting 
They take away that shield 
of safety and force the play 
to take place on an im- 
portant level, inside our 
minds. 

As for the violence, in- 
deed it is disturbing, and I 
suspect it was intended lo 
be thus. Excessive? Per- 
haps. Effective? For the 
most pari, yes And can vi- 
olence be comical? Yes, 
watch an old Abbott and 
Costello or Laurel and _ 
Hardy movie for uninten- 
tionally-comic violence. 
Again, view these "come- 
dies" after suspending your 
willing suspension of 
disbelief. 

As a sop to your reviewer, 
I should note that "A- 
luminum Paradise" had to 
buzz around inside my head 
for a good 24 hours before I 
could begin to come to 
terms with it, "Aluminum 
Paradise" is difficult and 
challenging; it should not 
be summarily dismissed 
because it has these qual- 
ities. Instead, PIT should be 
congratulated and en- 
couraged to continue spot- 
lighting the works of new 
playwrights, and Murray 
should be handed a well- 
sharpened pencil to get 
right to work on his next 
play.

"In my opinion. IPFW is 
much cheaper for most 
students. The social at- 
mosphere also differs, 
however." 



Since only 
three percent 
of the IPFW 
student body 
transfers to lU 
or Purdue 
each year, 
why do you 
think students 
stay here to 
obtain their 
degree?

Andy Piazza. 

'The win at St. Joe

The following Saturday 
Bellarmine avenged a two-

'Dons. 

"They (Bellarmine) 
played very well. It was 
their final home game and 
senior night, and they had 
us (IPFWi down by 20 at 



the half,'" said Piazza 

"We rallied twice in the 
second half to tie the score, 
but in the end the worst

next possession and they 
iBellarminei followed with 
another score to win by

"It was a courageous 
effort but we came up just a 
little bit short," said 
Piazza. 'Bellarmine had

Four Mastodons were in 
double figures for the game. 
Again, Ivy was the leading

Disabled Student Services 

Group inspirational, lacks funds 



By KIM SCHOGilAM 
Slaff Wrilcr 

The word Inspirationnl 
precisely describes the 
special lype of assistance 
offered to tiandicapped 
students at IPFW The 
Disiibled Student Services, 
formed in 1976. is presently 
located in WaJb Memorial 
Union Barbara Johnson, 
who coordinates and directs 
this deparlmenl, has earned 
a master's degree In special 
education Her 2'^ years of 
service in this deparlment 
offers her great satisfaction 
in helping students with 
various disabilities. Types 
of aid available include tu- 
toring, career and personal 
counseling, academic ad- 
vising and assistance spe- 
cifically structured for the 
handicap. Over mo sludenLs 
are enrolled in this 
program 

Welcome lo the resource 
center, a special place 
where the students gather 
lo share, meet and socialize 
with one another Many 
times a student can be 
helped to discover problems 
they may not even know 
they have The center en- 
courages the students' 
strength and enables them 
to build power and in- 
dependence within Ihom- 
selves. Counseling inspires 
students who may have 
problems with school- 
related learning habits. 

Many nttraclive features 
located lu the resource cen- 
ter Include Apple II and 
IBM computer terminals, 
three eleclrie typewriters, o 
Visual Tek machine to en- 
large prinlod material, two 
talking calculators with 
voice capability, a Perkins' 
Brailler and many period- 
icals for the students to en- 
joy. All of these skillful re- 
sources are located in a 
sound-proof room that as- 
sists the student needing to 
tape record, study or work 
alone without interference, 

IE there were one problem 
concerning the Disabled 
Student Services, it would 



be the source of money. The 
department began with a 
federal grant. Occasionally 
donations are earned by 
bakc-and ronsl-sales. along 
with other fund-raisers to 
help the deparlment buy 
new equipment and neces- 
sities. One year the Muddy 
River Hun, held in Fort 
Wayne, sponsored the dis- 
abled students at IPFW to 
help them with scholarship 
money. Very little money, 
though, is given to the ser- 
vice by the university, 

Three different issues 
were brought up by 
Johnson, including counsel- 
ing, evacuation and parking 
lor the disabled student, Of 
the three, one Issue in par- 
ticular was elat&gt;orated on 
more thoroughly. According 
lo Johnson, IPFW lacks 
sufficient counseling for the 
studenLs. Of the counselors 
available, most also work at 
Park Center One alter- 
native suggested by 
Johnson implies that more 
psychology and education 
majors could volunteer lo 
help out in this area. Dis- 
abled Student Services Is 
always looking for readers 
and any extra help, if any- 
one is Interested. 

Two programs that many 
disabled students are in- 
\'olved in are Go-Ball and 
DASBL 

Co-Ball is a very chal- 
lenging game played while 
the students are blind- 
folded, creating o very ex- 
citing match of skillful 
playing and teamwork. In 
every respect, it helps the 
students fc-el good about 
themselves 

DASEL stands for Dis- 
abled Students EKcelling in 
Leadership. This program 
is made up of Ki members, 
consisting of students and 
professors, who talk about 
feelings and share different 
problems among the group. 
This is a unique way for the 
students and profe^ors to 
communicate freely and 
openly with one another 

Johnson is a very caring 
and enthusiastic person who

Dirty dance contest held 



By RICItAIlDK, JOHNSON 
Fcaturi-s Editor 

"Downtown." a nightclub 
on Columbia Street, was 
packed Saturday night. 
Twenty people, ten women 
and ten men with numbers 
pinned to the backs of their 
shirts, made their way to- 
ward the newly-remodeled 
club's bi-lcvel dance floor 
for a chance in the 
spotlight 

March 5 marked Sandy 
Irish Productions' first 
"Dirty Dancing" contest 
and parly The purpose of 
the contest was to introduce 
tlie public to what Sandy 
Irish claims to be the first 
"Dirty Dancing" classes 
ever offered Irish is the 
daughter of Barbara 
Buhlman, associate profes- 
sor of math at IPFW 

Scheduled lo take place at 
D p.m. the contest was 
postponed to allow more 
couples lo enter, and the 
dance exhibition scheduled 
to take place after the con- 
test ended was held before 
the nervous contestants 
took the floor. The main 
event finally got underway 
about 9;45 pm 

The contest was con- 
ducted in heats and was 
judged by Leslie Speann 
and Terry Sweery. with the 



final two couples being 
judged by audience re- 
sponse. Tlie winners were 
Lori Kneppcr and Mark 
Fransen, seasoned dance 
partners. The second place 
couple was made up of 
Marlayne Hircel and 
Michael Williams, a man 
Hircel met only five min- 
utes l}efore the competition. 

When asked if she had 
expected more than ten 
couples to participate, Irish 
replied, "You have to walk 
before you run " Irish went 
on to say that if too many 
people had entered the 
competition, they may have 
become unwieldy, and that 
would defeat the purpose of 
the contest. She also ex- 
pressed a feeling that such 
a contest "feeds on itself" 
and becomes more popular 
with each subsequent 
contest. 

Despite the initial dis- 
interest in the contest, Irish 
expects her classes, which 
will be conducted in the 
club before it opens for 
business on Saturday 
nights, lo be filled to 
capacity. 

Top contestants could go 
on lo become teachers at 
the newly-founded dance 
school. Irish says she hopes 
to hold another contest in 
the near future.

Polanski's 'Frantic' not frantic 



Action! Adventure! In- 
trigue! Roman Polanski 
tries, but (ails, to include 
these in his new film, 

"Frantic." 



Review 



In ihis film Harrison Ford 
plays a doctor at a con- 
ference/vacation in Paris 
His luggage is shuffled in 
the airport, and he and his 
wife pick up the wrong 
suitcase When his wife 
subsequently disappears. 



he suspects it has some- 
thing lo do with the suit- 
case. The "plot" leading 
up to this point lends no 
logical rationale for this 
suspicion. 

So goes the rest of the 
movie Each action-aftcr- 
predictableaction seems 
lo occur only because it 
was decreed by the script 
and not by any logical 
train of thought. 

The franticness of the 
good doctor does not pro- 
duce enough energy to 
carry it through its longer- 
than-average length. The 
interaction of Ford and 



newcomer Emanuclle 
Seigner. the g'rl whose 
suitcase he accidentally 
copped, adds some 
energy, but it quickly 
dissipates. 

Harrison Ford, star of 
such greats as "Star 
Wars" and "Raiders of 
the Lost Ark," puts forth a 
good effort and makes his 
character real. Unfortu- 
nately the other charac- 
ters are very two- 
dimensional and lend no 
support to his role. 

Polanski. whose past 
films include "Tess" and 



"Rosemary's Baby," fails 
lo live up lo his film- 
making legend and directs 
a film with almost as little 
presence as his last dog, 
"Pirates!" He creates a 
Hitchcock environment 
but fills it with action that 
would make the master 
roll over in his grave. 

Ford does his best with 
what he has been given, 
but even Indiana Jones 
could not save this script.

dead body. Pigeons re- 
producing.) '2 Star out of
