Editor's note: 

This special edition of 
the I-PU Communicator 
has baen published to in- 
form the students ■ 
of Indlana-Purdui; Uni- 
versity of the recent Mus- 
ter Plan of the Indiana 
Commission for Higher 
Education We have prin- 
ted the unedited text of 
Volume IlChapterl, Sum- 
mary of Recommenda- 
tions, and portions of Vol- 
ume II Chapter 5, Aca- 
demic Mission State- 
ments, rel3v:i,ir to I-PU, 
In addition we hjiv-; prin- 
ted the tables of contents 
for both volumes of the 
plan. Complete copies 
of the plan may he stu- 
died In any of the dean's 
offices. 



In developing this planthe 
Commission sought to 
serve the following object- 
ives: 

1. To pre serve a nd 
strengthen the high quality 
of educational opportunities 
provided through the in- 
structloal, research, and 
public service functions 
performed by the state sys- 
tem of postsecondary edu- 
cation; 

2. To assure the availa- 
bility of a wide range of 
educational programs re- 
sponsive to the diverse 
needs of individuals of dis- 
parate Interests, back- 
grounds, and qualifications 
as well as to the needs of 
a rapidly changing society; 

3. To promote the person- 
al welfare of the citizens of 
Indiana and to ensure the 
continued growth and pro- 
gress of the state; 

4. To recognize the val- 
uable educational contribu- 
tions made by the Independ- 
ent postsecondary in- 
stitutions located through- 
out the state. 

In order to fulfill these ob- 
jectives, the Commission 
recommends that: 

1. Each of the state in- 
stitutions of postsecondary 
education prepare a de- 
tailed long range plan for 
each of its campuses and 
extension centers which 
will detail how the policy 
recommendations set fonh 
In the state plan will -be 



Implemented. These plans 
should be submitted for 
commfsslon review and in- 
corporation Into the state- 
wide plan on or before 
November 1, 1973. 

2. No state Institution 
of higher education receiv- 
ing state funds and as de- 
fined in Senate Enrolled 
Act No. 2, 1971 Indiana 
General Assembly, and as 
consistent with court Inter- 
pretations of civil rights 
legislation, should engage 
in any program, contract, 
or other activity with any 
Individual, organization, 
or Institution, which In any 
way discriminates against 
students, potential stu- 
dents, or any other Individ- 
ual or group with respect 
to race, color, sex, age or 
religion. Specifically, no 
state institution of higher 
education that contracts to, 
or accep:s funds with which 
to, provide educational 
services for any or- 
ganization shojldvest con- 
trol of admissions outside 
the institution's ad- 
ministration nor should 
such institutions engage In 
any program which re- 
quires that either students 
or Instructional personnel 
hold membership In any 
professional or trade group 
or organization. Excluded 
from these provisions are 
programs which are con- 
tracted with organizations . 
for their employees or 
members in which the full 
cost of Instruction isborne 
by the organization. 

3. Every effort should 
be made to effect 
economies in the operation 
of the state Institutions of 
higher education, both pub- 
lic and independent, 
through cooperative 
actions. Potential 
economies may exist in 
expanded use of the Indiana 
higher education telecom- 
munication system, 
coordinated academic 
calendars, shared use of 
libraries, computers and 
other resources, and con- 
tractual agreements for in- 
structional programs. 

4. Academically, every 
Indiana citizen may have 
access .tg the system at 

■ Ebe entry level, in either 



the occupational or general 
arts and sciences program 
categories. Continued en- 
rollment in these pro- 
grams should depend upon 
specified standards of per- 
formance. Access at the 
baccalaureate and graduate 
levels may be restricted 
in terms of resources and 
professional needs. 

5. Special programs 
designed to meet the needs 
of individuals with diverse 
educational qualifications. 
Interests and background 
should be provided by the 
state system to ac- 
commodate students such 
as those from lower socio- 
economic groups, minority 
groups, and older adults. 

6. Geographically, a stu- 
dent should be able to pur- 
sue at least the first two 

years of baccalaureate 
curriculum with each 
economic planning region 
of the state where 
economically justifiable. 
Occupational programs, 
through the associate de- 
gree level, shouW be con- 
sistent with the manpower 
requirements of local com- 
munities and the occupa- 
tional Interests of local 
students. Additional oc- 
cupational programs, based 
on national and statewide 
rather than regional man- 
power needs, should be 
provided at specified 
campuses where consistent 
with Institutional mission 
assignments. 

7. The state system 
search for new and innova- 
tive ways to provide post- 
secondary educational op- 
portunities for [he citizens 
of Indiana. Alternative ave- 
nues should be opened by 
which students can earn 
degrees or complete a 
major portion of the post- 
secondary work outside the 
traditional framework of 
the classroom. For 
example, the college level 
examination program, ed- 
ucational television 
facilities, "independent 
study and tutorials are 
several ways by. which ex- 
ternal degree programs 
may be developed.

8, Because some in- 
structional programs, es- 
pecially In the occupational 
and professional program 
categories, are the ex- 
clusive mission of one In- 
stitutional subsystem 
special arrangements will 
be necessary to ensure 
geographic access to such 
programs. 

9. Financial access 
should be improved through 
such programs as scholar- 
ships, grants, loans, and 
work opportunities and an 
expanded state scholarship 
program. 

10-A. The state scholar- 
ship commission ad- 
minister the state scholar- 
ship program consistent 
with policies established by 
the commission for higher 
education of the state of 
Indiana, 

lO-B, The total amount 
of funds recommended 
should be determined ac- 
cording to a formula de- 
veloped In cooperation with 
the commission for higher 
education. 

10-C. potential students 
eligible for state scholar- 
ship funds not be limited 
to recent high school grad- 
uates, veterans, and the 
traditional "college" pop- 
ulation, but rather include 
all citizens of the state. 

lO-D. The criterion for 
distribution of state 
scholarship funds be the 
financial need of the ap- 
plicant, providing that the 
applicant is accepted by or 
eligible to continue in the 
Indiana institution of higher 
education of his choice. 
Honorary awards, with no 
financial stipend attached 
and based solely upon 
scholastic achievement, 
should be continued. 

10-E, The magnitude of 
each applicant's financial 
need be determined based 
upon the tultfon/fee cost 
of attending the Indiana in- 
stitution of his choice. 

11. Special ef f on s be made 
to encourage individuals 
from those segments of 
society which traditionally 
have not pursued postsec- 
ondary education to take 
advantage ofpostsecondary 
educational opportunities 
provided by the state sys- 
tem. 

12. Future planning for 
instructional programs In 
Indiana postsecondary edu- 
cation In the occupational, 
arts and sciences, and pro- 
fessional program cate- 
gories embody a balance 
of the humanist, market 
place, and manpower re- 
quirements views. 

13. Academic and career 
advising sho^ld become a 
more recognized part of the 
Instructional function. 

14. New programs which 
are uniquely designed to 
respond to community and 
individual needs, which can 
reasonably be supported by 
available resources, and 
which are consistent with 



Institutional missions 
should be conceived and 
proposed to the com- 
mission for consideration. 

15-A. Postsecondary oc- 
cupatlonal programs 
should be made available 
through a dynamic and 
flexible delivery system, 
capable of adapting its ed- 
ucational offerings to meet 
the changing technological 
needs of the state. Such a 
delivery system does not 
necessarily require that a 
single Institution or agency 
be charged with sole re- 
sponsibility for occupa- 
tional programs. Rather, 
integration and coor- 
dination of all future efforts 
In postsecondary oc- 
cupational education are 
mandated for effective and 
efficient delivery of such 
.programs. Consideration 
for provision of occupa- 
tional programs through 
contractual agreements 
with other institutions, 
proprietary schools, busi- 
nesses and other organi- 
zations should be Included 
as an integral part of such 
a delivery system. 

15-B. Occupational edu- 
cation programs designed 
to produce marketable 
skills through the 

proficiency, certificate, 
and associate degree levels 
should be the particular 
mission of Indiana voca- 
tional technical college. 
Other public .institutions 
may also participate in the 
offering of these programs, 
primarily at the associate 
degree level. In fields of 
special competency. Be- 
cause of Its long history 
of programs activity in oc- 
cupational education, Vin- 
cennes University should 
continue Its current offer- 
ings. Ball State Univer- 
sity, Indiana State Univer- 
sity, Indiana University and 
Purdue University should 
continue to offer such as- 
sociate degree occupation- 
al programs on their 
several campuses as are 
consistent with their pro- 
fessional program mis- 
sion or as may be desir- 
able in the interests of 
contunued availability of 
diverse occupational edu- 
cation offerings to stu- 
dents. The public sector 
institutions should jointly 
review all occupational 
program offerings 
throughout the state and 
submit to the commission 
not later than March 1, 
1973. A recommendation 
for the desirable rangeand 
geographical availability of 
such programs on a coor- 
dinated, efficient basis. 
Wherever possible, such 
by the public institutions, 

15-C. Indiana Vocational 
Technical College should 
plan to offer some pro- 
grams which satisfy broad 
geographic demands and 
limited manpower needs In 
a limited number of loca- 
tions; for example, the 
Northern, Central, and 
Southern sections of the 
state are possible loca- 
tions. Satellite training 
centers, operated directly 
or through contractual ar- 



rangements with other in- 
stitutions, should offer 
regionally - oriented pro- 
grams. Maximum utiliza- 
tion should be made of all 
existing Institutional 
facilities and instructional 
resources. In some in- 
stance. It may be desir- 
able to have the general 
arts and sciences compon- 
ents of IVTC programs 
provided by other 
Institutions through 
contractual arrangements. 

15-D. A centrally admin- 
istered Indiana Vocational 
Technical College Program 
authority should becreated 
which will function as a 
funding agency for occupa- 
tional programs on a pro- 
ject basis. This program 
authority will allow flexi- 
bility in program offerings 
and their goegraphic loca- 
tion, and should be separ- 
ately funded by the General 
Assembly. Instructional 
programs may be contract- 
ed with both Independent and 
and public Institutions of 
higher education as well as 
proprietary institutions, 
businesses, and other or- 
ganizations. 

16, Indiana Vocational 
Technical College, in coop- 
eration with the Commiss- 
ion and other Institutions 
and agencies, establish a 
comprehensive and contin- 
uing mechanism to acquire, 
analyze, and report data and 
materials related to the es- 
tablishment of and need for 
occupational programs and 
training to meet the man- 
power and societal needs of 
the state. These data and 
materials must be an inte- 
gral part of the overall 
planning and evaluation of 
the occupational program 
category In Indiana. Ad- 
visory committees should 
be appointed to advise the 
Commission of the need for 
establishment or continua- 
tion of specific occupation- 
al programs In various re- 
gions of the state and to the 
Institution or campus which 
should be assigned respon- 
sibility for such programs, 
said advisory comm'.ttees 
to be individually concern- 
ed with: 

(a) Mechanical and engin- 
eering technologies 

(b) Data processing tech- 
nologies 

(c) Health services and 
paramedic technologies 

(d) Business technologies 

(e) Natural science tech- 
nologies 

(f) Public service techno- 
logies 

Members of these Advisory 
Committees should be 
drawn from business, in- 
dustry, labor, education, 
related professional fields 
and relevant governmental 
agencies. The focus of these 
Advisory Committees 
should Include the occupa- 
tional interests of students 
as well as manpower re- 
quirements. 

17. Students in all occupa- 
tional programs, both ter- 
minal and non-terminal, 
should be encouraged but 
not required to Include a 
general arcs and sciences 
component In their program 



of study. Special relation- 
ships should be developed 
Institutions, public and In- 
dependent, which have a 
general arts and sciences 
capability and those which 
do not. 

18. Aselected range of 
general arts and sciences 
baccaluareate level pro- 
grams be madeavailableat 
the regional campuses 
. (Communiversity) of the 
state.

the ma8ter!s degree level 
in the general arts and 
sciences program category 
generally be confined to the 
Universities Type I and Un- 
iversities Type n. 

19-B. New programs at 
Che intermediate degree le- 
vel in the general arts and 
sciences program category 
generally be confined tothe 
Universities Type I and Un- 
iversities Type n, 

19-C. New doctoral de- 
gree level programs In the 
general arts and sciences. 
If any, generally be con- 
fined to the Universities 
Type I in the public sector 
of the state system, 

20. New baccalaureate 
degree level professional 
programs should not be de- 
veloped on the regional 
(Communiversity) cam- 
puses except as consistent 
with recommendation num- 
ber 14 of this plan, 

21. Master's level pro- 
fessional programs for 
employed professionals 
pursuing graduate study on 
a part-time basis should 
be available in each re- 
gion of the state in fields 
and disclpllnescommensu- 
rate with regional needs. 
Professional programs 
which are the mission of 
one institutional subsystem 
but which are appropriate 
to the needs of a region 
served by a campus of a- 
nother institutional sub- 
system but which are ap- 
propriate to the needs of 
a region served by a cam- 
pus of another Institution- 
al subsystem should be of- 
fered through contractual 
agreements. 

22. Any new Inter- 
mediate degree level or 
doctoral degree level pro- 
grams in the professional 
program category develop- 
ed in the future should gen- 
erally be confined to the 
university type 1 campuses 
with the exception of those 
programs in professional 
fields where university 
type II Institutions possess 
special hist orical 
strengths. 

23, A special advi- 
sory committee with mem- 
bers from the several post- 
secondary school systems 
of the state and promi- 
nent lay groups, be formed 
to study the professional 
field of education and make 
recommendations to the 
Commission concerning 
the needs for programs In 
Che field of education, at 
all levels, and Institutions 



which should be assigned 
the missions for such pro- 
grams. 



24. The Advisory Sub- 
committee of the Commis- 
sion on Health Career Ed- 
ucation shall develop the 
necessary information 

bases for recommen- 
dations to the Commission 
relative to: 

{a) The evaluation of 
definitive health manpower 
studies Identifying region- 
al needs, 

(b) The comprehensive 
analysis of all postsecon- 
dary career educational ef- 
forts in the health related 
fields. 

(c) The coordination of 
the educational system out- 
put with manpower needs. 

(d&gt; An analysis of re- 
source allocation for the 
operating and capital needs 
of such programs. 



25. Each Institution and 
campus within the public 
sector of the state system 
of postsecondary education 
have a mission to engage 
In research activities com- 
mensurate with the in- 
structional functions per- 
formed and geographical a- 
reas served. 



26. Each Institution and 
campus within the public 
sector of the state sys- 
tem of postsecondary ed- 
ucation have a mission to 
provide public service ai;~-*"i ' 
tivitles commensurate with 
the instructional functions 
performed and geographi- 
cal areas served. 



27. The major mecha- 
nism for expanding coop- 
eration In the state sys- 
tem be the development of 
contractual agreements. A 
contractual agreement Is 
designed to draw on the 
strengths of each of the 
institutional subsystems 
and to avoid duplication of 
specific mission assign- 
ments while expanding ge- 
ographic access. Specific- 
ally, the several Institu- 
tional subsystems, both 
public and Independent, 
should develop general 
contractual agreements 
whereby the unique pro- 
grams, in all three pro- 
gram categories, of one 
institutional subsystem 
may be offered at the cam- 
puses of another. All such 
agreements should specify 
the institutional subsystem 
having responsibility for: 

(a) curricular content 

(b) admissions policy 

(c) faculty selection cri- 
teria 

&lt;d) funding 

(e) administrative and 
support services 

(f) facilities 

(g) certification (degrees) 
(h) counting of student en- 
rollments

Chapter S 



Academic Mission Statements - Region III 



The Commission for High- 
er Education was charged 
by the General Assembly 
with the responsibility of 
defining the educational 
mlBBjons of the several 
public institutions. The 
prescribed mission state- 
ments for the public sec- 
tor campuses are organ- 
ized by planning and de- 
velopment regions, and a 
brief descriptive statement 
Is Included for each of the 
Independent sector Institu- 
tions. 

In formulating these mis- 
sion statements, the Com- 
mission sought to imple- 
ment the specific policy 
recommendations set forth 
In Chapter IV as well as 
the broad objectives stated 
in Chapter I. The Com- 
mission strongly believes 
chat it Is the responsibil- 
ity of each campus to be 
directly responsive to the 
particular educational 

needs of the citizens of the 
region in which It is lo- 
cated. Each campus Is en- 
couraged to actively seek 
to motivate all segments 
of the population of its re- 
gion to take advantage of 
the educational opportuni- 
ties available, especially 
those to whom higher ed- 
ucation has traditionally 
been Inaccessible. To ac- 
commodate such new stu- 
dents, special advising and 
Instructional programs 
must be developed whic h 
will meet the varying needs 
of individuals with widely 
divergent educational qual- 
ifications and experiential 
backgrounds. An Integral 
part of eachcanpus' edu- 
cational mission Is this ob- 
ligation to tailor its pro- 
grams to the special de- 
mographic and economic 
characteristics of Its re- 
gion. 

In addition to recom- 
mending the formation of 
regional consortia (Rec- 
ommendation 25) of public 
and independent sector In- 
stitutions, the Commission 
also encourages the public 
Institutions to seek other 
means of cooperation. One 
suggestion is the selection 
of a "manager" institu- 
tion for campuses within 
a region or group of reg- 
ions. The designated In- 
stitution could provide Im- 
plementary and support 
services for all campuses 
within the region, and, in 
doing so, effect economies 
in operation. Other pos- 
sible means not currently 
envisioned should evolve 
as the Institutions actively 
strive to find innovative 
ways of achieving a higher 
degree of cooperation. 

Indiana Unhferstty- 
Puidue Unhforstty 
at Ft, Wayne 

Entry Into the under- 
graduate Instructional pro- 
grams of this campus 
should continue to be made 
more accessible. The 
campus should adopt a 
"very non- selective" ad- 
mlsslclns policy. The Fort 



Wayne Campus should seek 
to ensure that the first 
two years of most bac- 
calaureate curricula are 
made accessible to the cit- 
izens of the region. In 
addition, the Instructional 
programs of this campus 
should encompass a lim- 
ited range of general arts 
and science and pro- 
fessional offerings through 
the baccalaureate degree 
level. 

This campus should con- 
tinue to offer occupational 
programs, primarily at the 
associate degree level, 
consistent with the profes- 
sional program missions of 
Indiana University and 
Purdue University and as 
desirable in the Interests 
of continued availability of 
diverse options to the cit- 
izens of Region 3. Occu- 
pational programs of other 
institutional subsystems 
(particularly IVTC) should 
be offered at this campus 
through contractual agree- 
ments. 

Graduate programs of- 
fered at thiscampus should 
be limited to master's level 
curricula in the pro- 
fessional program cat- 
gory. All such programs 
should meet the education- 
al needs of employed pro- 
fessionals pursuing ad- 
vanced work on a part- 
time basis. Programs 
should not be implemented 
with the Intent of devel- 
oping a cadre of students 
pursuing graduate work on 
a full-time basis. Such 
graduate professional pro- 
grams which are appro- 
priate to the manpower and 
social needs of Region 3 
should be offered under the 
academic aegis of the ap- 
propriate professional 
schools at Purdue Univer- 
sity-Lafayette or Indiana 
Unlversity-Bloomlngton or 
offered through contractual 
agreements with other In- 
stitutional subsystems. 

This campus has a unique 
feature In Its Instructional 
function. It serves as a 
regional medical education 
center as part of the In- 
diana statewide medical 
education plan, adopted by 
the General Assembly In 
1971. 

Because teaching Is the 
primary mission of this 
campus, research of facul- 
ty members should be fo- 
cused on scholarship and 
depanmental research. 
However, the geographic 
and Industrial environment 
surrounding this campus 
make It appropriate for 
faculty to undertake lim- 
ited applied research to 
respond to regional needs. 
This campus should not en- 
gage in basic research ac- 
tivities. The public ser- 
vice function of this cam- 
pus should be focused on 
those activities which are 
specifically required by in- 
dividuals, groups, and or- 
ganizations located within, 
the region. 



Fort Wayne Bible 
College 

This specialized Insti- 
tution offers baccalaureate 
programs In education, 
music, and theology. It 
draws 33 per cent of its 
students from Region 3, 
and 60 per cent of its stu- 
dents from out of state. 
Fort Wayne Bible College 
has a "very non-selective" 
admissions policy. 

Huntington College 

As a liberal arts In- 
stitution offering baccal- 
aureate degree programs 
In general arts and sci- 
ence and In selected pro- 
fessional program cat- 
egories, thiscampusdraws 
44 per cent of its students 
from Region 3. The stated 
admission policy for this 
Institution is "selective." 

Indiana Institute of 
TechnologY 

A professional school with 
a "selective" admissions 
policy emphasizing engin- 
eering at the baccalaureate 



degree level, this institute 
is heavily oriented to serve 
out of state students, draw- 
ing 82 per cent of the stu- 
dents from outside the 
state. 

IVTC'Northeast 
Technical Institute 

This Institute should offer 
occupational education 

programs at the profici- 
ency, certificate, and asso- 
ciate degree levels. As 
the primary delivery sys- 
tem for occupational pro- 
grams in Region 3, this 
Institute should seek to of- 
fer a range of programs 
consistent with student In- 
terests and manpower 
needs In the region. Fu- 
ture planning should in- 
clude means of cooperat- 
ing with the other Insti- 
tutions located In Region 
3, this Institute should seek 
3, especially Indiana Unl- 
versIty-Purdue University 
at Fort Wayne, such as 
sharing of facilities and o- 
ther resources through 
contractual agreements. 



St. Francis College 

This comprehensive col- 
lege, offering general arts 
and science program and 
professional programs in 
education and business/
