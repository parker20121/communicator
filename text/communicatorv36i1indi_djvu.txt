IPFW mourns loss of Manzer 



■ IPFW Economics 
Professor John 
Manzer killed in 
collision on Dupont 

By Courtney Eyer 

Tragedy struck the IPFW 
community on August 8 1 " 
when 59-year-old professor 
John Manzer was fatally injured 
in an automobile accident on 
the north side of Fort Wayne. 
Manzer was a long-time eco- 
nomics professor at IPFW. 

A silver Audi, northbound 
on Dupont Road, struck Dr. 
Manzer's Corvette convertible 
as he was leaving Walgreen's and 
pulling onto Coldwater Road. 
Manzer's vehicle careened into 
a utility pole following the ini- 
tial collision and he was thrown 
from the vehicle. He was not 
wearing a seat belt but police 
are unclear as to the effect one 
would have had on the acci- 

The driver of the Audi was 
22-year-old Daniel Epple. Epple 
sustained a cut to his hand in 
the accident. He was taken to a 
local hospital for treatment. 

Upon their arrival, officers 
discovered Manzer's Corvette 
blocking the northbound lanes

aged extensively while Epple's 
Audi had rolled into a yard close 
by. The front of the Audi had 
sustained significant damage. 

According to police, the col- 
lision resulted in the loss of 
power by businesses and homes 
in the immediate area for a few 

Police investigators believed 
the driver of the vehicle lhat 
struck Manzer was under the 
influence of alcohol. Tests to 
establish the blood-alcohol 
level of the Audi's driver were 



JAPAN: Professor Manzer is seen pictured above enjoying the scenery with his wife Marilyn 
on a recent summer trip to Lake Ashte, Japan. Manzer has not only been a professor at IPFW 
for more tban 20 years, but was also involved in Junior Achievement of Northeastern Indiana. 

Professor remembered for sense of humor, dedication to instruction 



Around the late John 
Manzer, humor was conta- 
gious. Manzer saw the comedy 
in nearly any circumstance. He 
was always inventing jokes of 
his own to lighten the mood. 
His wit and humor were never 
lost on his wife Marilyn, who 
could always be made to laugh 
by her husband. 

Manzerwas born in Chicago. 
His earlyyears were spent in the 
western suburbs of Chicago, 
where he attended elementa- 
ry school. Manzer continued 
on to a Catholic high school 
for boys, St. Procopius High 
School, in Lisle, Illinois where 
he graduated in 1964. 



Manzer was a musician who 
played the guitar from an early 
age. Growing up in the Chicago 
area, he joined several bands 
and played at a number of dif- 
ferent venues, such as bowling 
alleys and local bars, through- 



out the early sixties. Eventually, 
Manzer connected with a band 
called The Cryan' Shames, and 
the group had a hit reach the 
billboard charts entitled "Sugar 
and Spice." 

The college years of Manzer 
were spent at Northern Illinois 
University in Dekalb. Illinois 
He received his Bachelor's 
degree in 1968 and would later 
return to achieve his doctorate 
in 1979. 

From 1968 to 1977, Manzer 
was a teacher of high school 
business at Lake Park High in 
Roselle, Illinois. 

Following the receipt of 
his doctoral degree in 1979, 
Manzer went on to teach at 
Michigan State University until 
19BI when he came to IPFW. 

Manzer was signed on to 
direct the Center for Economic 
Education at IPFW. The center 
focuses on economii education 



in public schools for all grade 
levels. 

Manzerwas heavily involved 
with Junior Achievement of 
Northeastern Indiana, working 
to expand their programs for 
the last 20 years, He would write 
and edit manuals that aided in 
the support of economic lit- 
eracy. His persistent endeav- 
ors in the realr

in early 2000. "The number of 
students that will be impacted 
in the local area, in the state, 
nationally and internation- 
ally is quite large because it's 
published on the web," said 
Nowak. 

Seven Allen County teachers 
were published on the peer- 
reviewed RCC site. The con- 
cept behind the workshop was 
to have the teachers design.

robots to apply in practical

Teacher Workshop Curricula 
Featured on NASA Web Site 

IPFW's Division of 
ContinuingStudies has received 
word from NASA that will start 
its SO" 1 year on a good note. 
The LEGO Robotic Design for 
Teachers Workshop had seven 
of its submitted curricula pub- 
lished on NASA's website. 

This is a major improvement 
from the last notable submis- 
sions in 2002, when the work- 
shop only saw one of its four- 
teen accepted for publication 
by NASA. 

The Curricula were chosen 
for the space agency's Robotics 
Curriculum Clearinghouse Web 
site. The robotics workshop is 
popular due to its appeal to the 
creativity and imagination of 
area schoolchildren. 

Jeffrey A. Nowak, assistant 
professor of science education, 
has been involved with the 



applied to student ranging from 
kindergarten through seniors in 
high school. 

"This workshop is a col- 
laboration between the school 
of education, and engineering 
technology computer science," 
Said Nowak, "It brings together 
inquiry-based learning under 
a problem-based learning 

thinking, problem solving and 
hands on education are all a big 
uruli Thing focus." 




Moving: The LEGO RCX unit is being operated in the 
robotics workshop held over the summer. 



Nowak argues that such 
workshops are very important 
for the Midwest, and especial- 
ly northeast Indiana, because 
Indiana is commonly known 
as a state suffering from "brain 
drain". He adheres to the argu- 
ment that many technologi- 
cally minded graduates leave 



the area in search of better 
opportunity elsewhere in the 
nation, such as Silicon Valley in 

"Its one of the reasons why 

we have the innovation center," 

explained Nowak, "Because of 

the brain drain, we have a need

The IPFW Smoking Policy 
has been modified. 

Smoking is now limited 
to parking lots or designated

The new policy, as slated 
in the Regulations Governing

of University Facilities at 
Indiana University-Purdue

"Smoking is prohibited in any 
University faeility and on any

smoking areas." 

Any specific questions 
regarding the Smoking Policy 
should be directed to Vice

are located on the left-hand side

Within a week of installing 



the new computers, a student 
had already broken her flash

in the USB port under the cover. 
Consequently, herfiles were lost,

During the summer semester, IPFW i

Kristy Brewer, a manager of the Subway 



Regular Subway prices are between 
three and four dollars but daily specials 
cost $2.49 for each sandwich. By asking 
a Subway employee or finding the menu, 
customers can see the special sandwich 
each day. 

Cornelius Gram, a staff member who 
worked for five years at IPFW, said, "I 
am going to order a turkey sandwich." 
She continued, "I eat daily specials and 1

Regular large soft drinks are $1.59 and 
refills cost only 75 cents. Kristy said, "Our 
customers can refill their containers as 
many times as they want and we allow it." 
She continued, "Choosing Subway is not 
only saving money but also getting healthy 
food. Subway is healthy because of the 
focus on veggies and nutrition. By eating 
veggie sandwiches daily, students gain the 
highest energy." 

Not all students eat on campus. Some go 
off campus and some bring lunchboxes.

Dr. David Dilts, co-chair of the IPFW Business 
Department and a cu] league of Man/cr's, stressed 
the influential role I &gt;r. Man/er played in the lives 
of his students. "Commitment to their education 
was evident in everything he did," he said. "The 
loss of such a noble and devoted teacher at the 
pinnacle of bis career is particularly tragic to the 
university community." 

Chancellor Michael Wartell praised Dr. 
Manzer's work with the Center for Economic 
l.dueation, euiisuleiini; him a 'fixture at the uni- 
versity." 

"Anytime you lose someone like that unex- 
pectedly, it is a tragedy." said the Chancellor. 

While Dr. Manzer's career centered on eco- 
nomics, he had an inquisitive spirit. Physics and 
the workings of the universe were a major inter- 
esi and Man/er would take notes and highlight 
chapters from books which fascinated him.

Manzer's love ol vehicles led him to purchase 
his Corvette, which lie was driving in the acci-

Chevy Impala in high school and his wife told the 
Communicator how he would "reminisce about 
the sound of the engine and say thai tars today 
sounded 'wimpy.'" 

Manzer loved bis new car and enjoyed driving 
just to drive, maneuvering around campus wirh

Dr. Manzer is survived hy his wife. Marilyn and 
his son, I'cter. Peter attends Indiana University

Although Sheehan has left Texas to

will be broadcast with a new advertise-

It has been a summer of reality shows 
nationwide A slew of new "real life" cuts 
have sprung up on nerworks. cable and

has been bettered received or higher

But of all the reality possibilities, why 
is it that Hogan and his family are the 
most watched? 1 mean, other than the 
fact that he is fteakin' Hulk Hogan. 

Nestled deep into VH 1 s Sunday night 
Celehreality lineup. Hogan and his fam- 
ily actually go through real life issues in 
a more normal way that I have ever seen 
from a celebrity of my television screen. 
Also, unlike the rest of the VH1 lineup, 
the show seems actually have a purpose. 
I know, how dare they. 

But this may end up being the trend 
that saves the faded experiment called 
reality television. Yeah? Hulk Hogan 
saves reality television? That's pretty 
messed up in the long run. But face 
the facts, the show's basis is simple and 
affective. 

It follows a great athlete who inspired 
millions for upwards of 20 years on his 
physical decline. The main storyline 
focuses on how real lire is after an ath- 
lete (or sports entertainer) retires and 
cannot physically compete any longer. 

With the likes of Michael Jordan and 
Barry Bondscomingback to their respec- 



A secondary story follows Hogan the 
father, trying to balance being art pro- 
fessional wrestling icon and raising his 
two teenage children. The girl, Brooke, 
is a sixteen year old pursuing a singing 
career while fending off guys left and 



i between Brooke and 
her mother when it comes to the oppo- 
site sex and Hulk's downright opposing 
attitude might even be the most real 
thing about this show. 

Not to mention his son Nick who is 
just finding girls— and taking them to 
the hot tub while the parents are out 
of town. But no, despite the youngest 
Hogan's best attempts, this is not the 
Real World of 2005. It is not a show 
based solely on drinking beer and hook- 
ing up. Instead, it is like the Real World 
of the mid- 1 990's. It exhibits all the same 
qualities that made the original Real 
World so watchable and dynamic. 

The main quality? It's real. And yes, I 
am sure that having Hogan as part of the 
program helps. He is going to draw in a 
different crowd than almost any person 
on reality television. But he doesn't use 
that fact to trump the pureness of his 
show or his life. 

Instead, Hulk Hogan just lives every- 
day as another day. "Hogan Knows Best" 
is a show, that in it's purest form, is 
about nothing at all. Ironically, it looks 
like a show with no catch and no hook 
maybe the saving grace of reality televi- 

Wait, maybe I can make a lot of 
money by selling one of these shows 
then. Quick, somebody call FOX, they'll 
buy anything.

Negatives to Positives 



Staff Editorial 



The fall semester 
should always start off in 
a positive light, however 
some students return- 
ing might notice the con- 
stant struggle in commut- 
ing has been worsened 
by two notorious travel 
demons- gas prices and 
construction. We at The 
Communicator hope that 
you can take some nega- 
tive things during your 
day and turn them into 
positives by simply look- 
ing at them in a different 
light. 

If you have a problem 
with keeping your gas tank 
full try the public trans- 
portation. With the rise in 
gas prices there has been 



a reported 9% increase in 
the number of people rid- 
ing Citilink. Perhaps this 
is due to the fact that a 
one-way trip on the bus 
would cost you less than 
half what a gallon of gas 
would. 

But saving money isn't 
the only thing that the 
Citilink is good for. 

Public transportation 
is a great place for a per- 
son new to Fort Wayne to 
meet people. While you 
save gas you can make 
new friends! 

If public transporta- 
tion is not something 
that you're interested in 
then find a friend with 
good shocks and play the 



Clinton Street Dodge 'Em 
game. That is, take bets 
on how many holes you 
can miss while staying in 
pace with traffic. It you're 
not up dodging the holes 
every person in the car 
can hold a glass of water. 
After the trip through 
the Holey Land is made, 
the person with the most 
amount of water still in 
their cup wins. 

Although construction 
and gas price woes will 
continue to haunt those 
who commute, it is always 
best if one looks at the 
world in a positive light. 

And remember... that

In war. sometimes 

the other cheek will get hurt 





The Tiger's Pen 

By Anthony Maurer 

ttnaurer@ipfwcommijnicator.c 



Whether you are talking about reli- 
gion, philosophy, or simply common 
decency, you will hear the argument 
against violence in all forms. I'm a 
Roman Catholic, so I hear the pro- 
fession of "turning the other cheek". 
Which means to me that one should 
do the righteous but harder task of 
absorbing whatever blow was dealt 
without returning the aggression. This, 
to me, seems to be the correct and 
more civilized action to take. 

However, I have come across experi- 
ences and scenarios that put this idea 
into question. The obvious that comes 
to mind is a .situation where death 

taken. Many people believe that it is 
justified to use self defense in a situa- 
tion of mortal danger. However, some 
would still suffer death to uphold and 
adhere to the principles of nonvio- 

One could also imagine a situation 
where action can prevent harm from 
befalling another, perhaps even a loved 
one. What would you do if your friends 
or family were in danger? I believe 
that the best solution to conflict is one 
achieved by non-violent means. But I 
couldn't bear to live with myself con- 
taining the knowledge that my inac- 
tion caused harm to those I hold dear. 
I would definitely engage the indi- 
vidual who puts my loved ones at risk. 
Perhaps this is yet another flaw that 
comes with trappings of humanity. 

Such a question has led to debates 
at all levels of life, including the most 
important, war. The Greek philosopher 
Aristotle claimed, "We make war that 
we may live in peace." A good example 
would be to observe World War II. It 
seems a tyrant rises up every few cen- 
turies that possessed the ambition and 
capability to pursue world domina-

Mix ft match with the WB 



Wire Column 



If UPN is Where the Girls Are. then 
The WB is where the girls grow up. The 
network that was once home to "Felic- 
ity," "Dawson's Creek" and "Buffy the 
Vampire Slayer" appears to be having a 
Not -A-Girl- Not- Yet-A -Woman moment. 
(That's Mrs. l : ederline to you.) 

"People in their late 20s, early 30s do 
not perceive the network yet as ' for me,'" 
WB chairman Garth Ancier toldTVcritics 
on Friday. "It's son of a guilty pleasure, or 
people jusi don't acknowledge watching 
it, and we're trying to crack it." 

Full disclosure: I loved "Summer- 
land." However: The WB frog is dead, 
and it tasted like [esse McCartney. 

I was supposed to leave the Televi- 
sion Critics Association press tour after 
the cable portion ended last week. But 
I stuck around to see what a broadcast 
network panel was like. 

OK, I really stayed for The WB party. 
Which was so worth it. I gleefully rati 
around interviewing every member of 
the "Gilmore Girls" cast I could find. 
More on that (Logan, Logan, Logan) in a 
loiihu rig column. I promise. 

But back to the state of The WB. You 
know those days when you stand in front 
of the closet and can't decide what to 
wearf That's kind of how I feel ahout The 
Wfi's fall schedule. Does "dihnore Girls' 
really go with the paranormal thriller 
'■Supernatural"? Hmm, let's just try on 
some sniff and see how it fits. 

Looking at The WB's four new shows 
coming this fall, I really can't tell what 
it wants to be when it grows up. Then 
again, when I was the same age _ the 
network ntms 10 Uiis year _ I wanted to 
be a ballerina ... 

"Supernatural": The most promising 
of the bunch stars lared I'adalecki (Dean 
from "Gilmore Girls") and Jensen Ackles 
(his bio says "Smallville," hut I seem to 
recall him being on "Days of Our Lives") 
as brothers who chase ghost stories and 
urban legends. 

"This is the show that's designed 
to make it difficult to go to sleep that 
night alter you watch it." said 



producer McG ("The O.C.," "Charlie's 

Angels"). "Like, if you're watching it by 
yourself, you're in trouble because your 

mind is going to he playing (ricks on you 

Oh, and McG also said that the show 
will he 'extremely Go ogle -worthy," so all 
you fans of "MythBusters" can go nuts. 
Prognosis: Fxcellent. Probability that I 
will watch: 0. 1 can't even watch previews 
for "Hark Water." I have to avert my eyes. 
(Premieres 9 p.m. Sept. 13, WB) 

"lust Legal": Ruddy comedy, or maybe 
dramedy, starring an unlikely (of course) 
pail of lawyers set in Venice Beach. Don 
Johnson is the alcoholic fallen star; lay 
Baruchel ("Million Dollar Baby") is the 
boy wonder who rejuvenates his passion 
for the law, blah blah blah. 

Honestly, the premise sounds a bit 
schmaltzy but series creator Jonathan 
Shapiro kind of sold me on it during the 
panel. Proceed with caution. (Premieres 
9 p.m. Sept. 19) 

"Related": Four sisters love, laugh 
and cry in New York City. Stars Jenni- 
fer F.sposiio ("Spin City"), Lizzy Caplan 
("Mean Girls") and some other people, 
the sisters have really weird jobs. 

Like, one of them is a therapist who 
specializes in transvestite mental health. 
Huh? "Related" (premieres 9 p.m. Oct. 5) 
comes from a creative team whose re- 
sume includes "Friends" and "Sex and 
die City," but that is not necessarily a 
quality guarantee. 

I Isewhere: Jason Lewis ("Sex and 
the City") and Kaley Cuoco ("8 Simple 
Rules") join die cast of "Charmed" (pre- 
mieres 8 p.m. Sept. 25) instead of Mark 
McGrath... 

Haylie Duff (best known as "Hilary's 
sister") joins "7th Heaven" (premieres 8 
p.m. Sept. 19) ... James Marsters ("Buffy ) 
will appear on "Smallville" as Professor 
Milton Fine, aka "Brainiac" (premieres 8 
p.m. Sept. 29) ... Aquaman visits "Small- 
ville" and dates Lois Lane ... Speaking of 
Aquaman, my favorite line from HBO's 
"Entourage" so far this season: "What is 
...Smallville?" 



When a good idea goes all wrong 



Simply Ludicrous 

By Courtney Eyer 

ceyer@ipfwcommunicator.org 



During the writing of this intro- 
duction (or should I say. disclaimer), 

I came to the realization of why I 
wanted to write a column. 

I feel obligated to entertain you 
in some way, make your life different 
and perhaps more enjoyable Irom the 
mere reading of my words. I give no 
guarantees of success. 

For this first week, in the hopes of 
providing at least the tiniest crumb of 
enrichment, [have decided to include 
a quote from a writer I hold dear. 

He regularly causes me to laugh 
and oftentimes, he causes me to 

If through my columns I can 
arouse either of these actions in only 
a handful of individuals, 1 would be 
pleased with the result. 

"This is a hard world to be ludi- 
crous in, with so many human beings 
so reluctant to laugh, so incapable 
of thought, so eager to believe and 
snarl and hate" 
Kurt Vonnegut 

So in reading my column, think if 
you want, laugh if you can. Libel me 
a communist if you so choose, but 
prepare yourself for ludicrous enter- 
tainment nonetheless. 

lake heed however, for entertain- 
ment ("Are you not entertained?' 
questions Russell Crowe in Gladiator), 
can often assume gruesome quali- 



As a result, I ended up with the 
following. You can't really call it a 

one-act play, because there isn't an 



new education bill that affects us all 
or even the images on our currency 
(foreshadowing perhaps?). 

And while Mr. Community won't 
make an appearance every week, he 
will forever prowl the streets, foster- 
ing solidarity wherever he goes. 

You never know when or where he 
may put in an appearance. 

So here it is, enjoy. 1 think, well, 
it's simply ludicrous.. .hut I hope you 
read it anyway. 

Episode I - 
The Phantom Homeless 

(Outside a building in Port Wayne. 
It can be any building, bin a parading 
mastodon must be present. 

We see a domineering schmuck of 
a man; blind to the world around him 
except for the painted mastodon he 
admires, this is MR. COMMUNITY. 

A smile crosses his face and the 
facade of perfection in his manner is 
apparent. MR. HOMELESS MAN stands 
to the side of MR. COMMUNITY. 

MR. HOMELESS has a beard that 
reaches the middle of his chest, his 
clothes are rumpled and he is watch- 
ing his own feet as he scuffs them 
absently on the pavement. 

The sun is shining... it is a won-

MR. COMMUNITY: Well, hello there 
Mr. Homeless Man. ..isn't that mast- 
odon a fine-looking thing? 

MR. HOMELESS MAN: Yes. it is Mr. 
Community... but I sure am hungry. 

COMMUNITY: You could try and 
eat that mastodon if you'd like Mr 
Homeless.. .(He chuckles audibly)... 
but I don't know how tasty it would 
be! 

HOMELESS: (cracking a false smile 



COMMUNITY: In all honesty Mr. 
Homeless... I have some wonderful 
news for you and your hunger.. .and 
it most certainly involves yon masl- 

H0MELESS: Really? 

COMMUNITY: Certainly. Very soon, 
all me mastodons you see in the 
city as you stroll about looking for a 
short-lived but cozy bed each night 
are going to be auciioned off. And do 
you know what is going to happen 
with thai ruoiic;, Mr Homeless? 

HOMELESS: No sir. I guess I don't, 

COMMUNITY: Then.. .finally.. .after 
a portion of the money goes to pay 
someone's salary at a charitable 
organization, we're going to buy you 
some food Mr. Homeless. (The grin 
on COMMUNITY'S face somehow wid- 
ens, and he peers pathetically at MR. 
HOMELESS) Aren't we kind? 

HOMELESS: Wow! That is gener- 
ous... When is all this going to hap- 
pen Mr. Community? 

COMMUNITY: Oh... months from 
now. (Gloom envelopes the figure of 
MR. HOMELESS) 

We have got to leave these mast- 
odons on display for a while. 

I mean. ..golly.. .they're foster- 
ing solidarity throughout the entire 
region. 

But each and every time you see 
one, you be sure to think of that meal 
you'll have, and you be sure to think 
of Mr Community. 

(MR. COMMUNITY exits withagrin on

COMMUNITY: On second thought, 
you'd belter not get too close to those

you couldn't come within two feet 
of one without being arrested. (He 
chuckles again) 

HOMELESS: Uhh...Okay... 



MR. HOMELESS sinks to the ground. 
clutching his stomach in agony. 

He sits there briefly before an offi-

Nearly 650 moslly northeastern Indiana children grades two 
through 12 were able to experience camps offered by the IPFW 
athk-iic department this summer. 

Boys and girls participated in volleyball, soccer, basketball 
and baseball camps in June and July, including new men's head 
basketball coach Dane Fife's first camp and true outreach to the 
community. 

"We weren't trying to make money off of it, we just basically 
wanted to give kids and families of this community something 
from the university.'' said I ifc, just three months away from the 
start of his first season as a Division I coach it was jusi agreat way 
to reach out to the community and give back." 

The Fife camp taught aver t.(] children how to improve basic 
fundamentals and tc-t hnic|iics along with a belter jump shot. Held 
ai ihe Gates Center, the camp was for children entering grades two 
through eight. 

"We were expecting less, but we had more success than 
expected," Fife said. "We had about a month to prepare and do the 
advertising; we didn't do much advertising, il was |usl kind of word 
of mouth. We were very pleased." 



Women's vollevh.illi.nai h Kclle\ H.ink-\ I lotion - whose camp 
ran two weeks in lul\ and featured 22(1 girls - said for many of the 
participants in any of the camps this is their first real experience 
with the sport. 

"It is important that they have a good experience," Hartley, the 
two-time Independent ( oath of (he Year said 'But we especially 
hope it is a good first experience for the young ones and that it 
is positive. We teach the realh young ones to have fun and gain 
an appreciation for (he sport and we push the older ones in 

"Maybe they'll come back to IPFW and play volleyball. We hope 
at least they had ,i good espi-rieiuc and huilt confidence." 

Men's volleyball i n.uli \rme Hall didn't cnjo\ the same success 
as his counterpart and was Ion til lo cancel his camp because not 
enough participants signed up. 

Hartley Hutton said she expected more high school-level 
children in her camp hut chalked up the lack of participants in that 
age group to corilln ting schedules with other camps. She added 
that many high school teams group together and go off to varsity 
camps elsewhere to maintain a better camaraderie. 

The IPFW baseball program got far t v than it bargained for 

when 65 regional kids graduating this year through 2008 showed 
up for the first annual talent showcase on Aug. 7.

The man who orchestrated 
the entire brainchild of the 
Showcase was IPFW coach Terry 
Stefankicwicz. Six years ago, he 
was watching the preseason NIT 
college basketball tournament 
and thought a similar preseason 
event for soccer would be a 
splendid idea. So he took the 
scheme to his former college 
soccer coach and one of the 
best in history, Indiana's Jerry 
Vcagley, and things took off

influence to bring the nation's 
top-notch soccer programs to 
the event, including his national

Initially, all games were 
played one after the other at 
Memorial Stadium until the 
Hefner Fields complex was 
completed in 2001. Once the 
IPFW athletic department 



'We do everything \

Pope said. "The coaches have 
a very good feeling for this 
event. There was a quote in the 
Virginia press release about (his 
event and the coach said this 
had an NCAA tournament-kind 
atmosphere." 

Indiana coach Mike Freitag, 
who is coaching his second 
year after taking over for the 
now-retired Yeagley, told Pope 
the Showcase atmosphere is 
electric and the hospitality Is 
second to none. 

So with all of this success 
and praise, what comes next for 
IPFW and its Soccer Showcase? 

The first thing the university 
will look at Is the Thursday

"I think we're going to lock

Another step Pope and his 
athletic department will look 
Into is the prospect of a "Soccer 
Showcase for every sport." 
By that, he simply means 
preseason events that draw 
respected colleges and area 
high schools to participate in 
tournaments or head -to -bend 
match-ups. He noted that the 
IPFW golf program -a program 
that didn't exist three years 
ago - will host its first ever 
Invitational in October as a step 
in this direction. 

This also makes sense for the 
basketball programs, being that

Sinfully fun; movie gives

release of Sin City.

the DvD as soon as I could. 

Like a kid in a candy shop, 
I wandered the movie section 
until I found a wall devoted 
to Frank Miller and Robert 
Hodriquez's film noir. Wow! 
There were 4 different covers to 
choose from. 

I picked my favorite "short 
story," from the movie, the one 
with Clive Owen and Rosario 
Dawson.. .you know.. .the hook- 
er-queen and plopped down 
what amounts to half-a-tank-

So, lets start right there a 
take a gander at the box. Yes, 
the box. 

Other than different covers, 
which is so arbitrary it hurts, 
nothing is fancy... no foil leaf, no 
3D crazy shapes...just a black 
and white square with red let- 
ters and those hyper-annoying 
clips on the side. 

I hate those clips; loathe 
them with all my little heart. I 
tend to break them off. The Box 
promised nothing in the way of 
special features, save some DTS

said Afzaal. "With our band, it is completely up to

You don't have to agree with it, because there is

"We have played with Poet Named Revolver, 
Burial Year, Dust from 1000 Years, and Lone Wolf

"Lone Wolf and ( nh, made the comment that 
we have a very Midwest sound,' added Afzaal. "In 
our minds that associates us with bands like Peli-

"Bands shouldn't have to stick to a certain 
genre," added Strater. "We're Americans, and 
we're Americans thai live in the Midwest, so we 
don't have that much culture, but we're more 
than happy to embrace what we have."

All Night Skate doesn't seem to have future 
goats, large plans for a tour, or even a strong de- 
sire to get signed. 

"We're losing Michelle soon," said Strater. 
She's going to Oregon. That is going to be a huge 
void to fill. She is the one person 111 the band thai

to do is tell her what key it's in and she just comes

"We're going into this with pretty much the 
same mentality as we did when we were in Plain

to have fun, and if something happens as far as 
signing, or if someone asks us to tour with them, 
that's cool, we'll do it and have fun. But, as far as 
our own tour goes, we need to expand our cata- 
logue a bit." 

All Night Skate hasn't completely ruled out vo- 
cals in future songs. 

"Our current EP is a great snap shot of where 
we are right now." said Afzaal. "It's just that so far 
none of the songs have needed lyrics." 

"Besides," added Strater. "none of us can sing. 
We just usually prefer the music to speak for it

BOOK REVIEW 

By Steve Pepple 

speppleeipfwcommunicator.org 



Like numerous books on race, Kitwana's 
essay on gangsta' rape and suburban culture 
answers many questions on issues few would 
dare to ask. Much like the "n"word debate, 
there is an argument over gangsta' rap. Can a 
sometimes offensive and controversial genre 
be meaningful? Is it better as exclusive or 
widely accepted? 

Kitwana additionally tackles issues, such as the 
state of the hip hop music industry. Although 
the book strays from thesis, Kitwana's 
impression of racial events and issues is 
relevant Kitwana, the former executive editor 
of The Source, has taught political science at 
Kent state in recent years, and is a regular 
contributor to NPR.

you always get in free (perks baby!) 



I think the bartender said it best, "Keep it 
cheap!'' Yeah that's right. Ihe people inside the 
enormous bar area are young, sexy and courte- 
ous individuals They are not .ilraid to give drinks 
away to their favorite customers as long as you 
can keep it real.
