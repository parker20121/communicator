NEWS BRIEFS 

IPSGA APPROVES NEW 
GRAD STUDENT FEES 

IPSGA denied two of the athletic depan- 
meni's proposals for student fee increases, 
but passed an increase for graduate stu- 
dents. 

Rajat Suri, student body president, said 
they passed the student service fee for 
graduate students because they have the 
same opportunities as other students. 

Suri said graduate students should be 
treated as other students. 

"We wanted to make them more of a 
pan of the student body," he added. 

Another reason for assessing graduate 
students with the student service fee, Suri 
explained, was because they should be 
brought more into the mainstream. 

He added student senate in no way favors 
student fee increases. 

'SCROOGE' STRIKES 
PARKING GARAGE 

The Christmas season hasn't warmed 
everyone's heart at IPFW, as was evi- 
denced on campus last Sunday. 

Forcing his way into an automobile in 
the parking garage, a local thief helped to 
spoil the Christmas season for one IPFW 
student. 

The student drove to campus after shop- 
ping and parked on the first level of the 
garage, according to the campus police re- 
port , 
"The culprit jimmied the lock somehow," 
said Lauren Den- 
Hartog. IPFWs 
chief of police, 
"There were pack- 
ages in plain view in 
the back seat." 
Approximately $75 
worth of newly pur- 
chased goods were 
taken in the theft, in- 
cluding cologne and 
clothing apparently 
intended as gifts, according to DenHartog. 
"Theft goes up during the Christmas sea- 
son," said DenHartog, "Students and facul- 
ty need to keep valuables out of plain sight 
in their parked cars. You also need to be 
positive that your car is always locked 
when it is unattended... We have a pretty 
safe environment, but theft can happen 
anywhere." 

The investigation has yet to yield a sus- 
pect in the theft, and police ask anyone 
who may have information on this or any 
odier campus crime to contact the depart- 
ment. 

SANTA TO VISIT 
FOR BREAKFAST 

Some parents will bring curious young 
ones to have breakfast with the red- 
cheeked myth himself, Santa Claus. Lucky 
fKOple who bought tickets to the event on 
Saturday, Dec. 12 will have a chance to get 
their picture taken with Santa and see the 
Voyageur Puppet Theater. 

SAB will sponsor the breakfast, which 
will be served in Walb Memorial Union 
Ballroom from 9 to 1 1 a,m.

Experts offer tips for exam week survival 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Chief Reporter 

With finals week just days 
away students are faced with the 
inevitable symptoms of sucss. 
Anger, headaches, aggressive 
behavior, volatile tempers, and 
failing grades arc jusi a few 
ways stress is manifested in stu- 
dents. 

According to Ron Shivly, in- 
take manager of Charier Beacon 
Hospital, stress is a condition of 
everyone's life. 

Shivly discussed some reme- 
dies to lessen the effects of 
stress. He said planning ahead, 
rest, exercise, eating right, and 
striking a balance between 
school and other activities will 
allow for a more relaxed envi- 



Other methods Charter Bea- 
con promotes are studying in 
moderation and accepting 
limitations. 

David McCants, vice chancel- 
lor of academic a^'airs, also had 
ideas on dealing with stress. He 
suggested blocking out specific 



limes 10 study and taking 
breaks. It is imponant to follow 
the schedule and to budget time, 
as well as planning play lime. 

Another tip 
MeCanis offered 
was planning a 
special celebra- 
tion after finals 
week. He said it 
is important to 
have something 
to look forward 
to after the tests. 

When students 
don't follow a 
studying sched- 
ule, McCanls 
said, siudenls 
can become 
overloaded. 

Shivly added, 
"Many limes 
students get overloaded and that 
leads 10 more stress. Stress can 
lead 10 depression, which is one 
of the biggest problems loday." 

Sometimes, Shivly said, siu- 
dents have such a ditficuli time 
coping with multiple responsi- 



bilities thai they lum to dmgs 
and alcohol. He said such 

placebos only heighten prob- 
lems. 



Student Stress 




Student Bel

"Many limes students get 
overloaded and that leads 
to more stress. Stress can 
lead to depression, which 
is one of the biggest 
problems today." 

-Ron Shivly 



Sally Filch, secretary of tran- 
sitional studies, said many siu- 
denls look to tutors for assis- 
tance as finals get closer. She 
said the number of students re- 
questing help has increased in 
the past few weeks. 



However, Fitch explained, tu- 
tors arc usually not available be- 
cause the program ends a week 
before finals to allow tutors 
study lime. 

To help the 
siudcnis who 
wailed until the 
last minute, 
iransilional 
studies has sev- 
eral lips on 
studying. Fitch 
said private tu- 
tors are avail- 
able, and stu- 
dents can check 
out books and 
videos detailing 
effective icsi- 
taking methods. 
Transitional 
studies recom- 
mends students begin time man- 
agement, eating right, practicing 
effective studying procedures, 
and learning from past tests. 

Freshman Troy Robinson was 
a victim of the last-minute syn- 
drome. He said he put off doing 



his English homework until the 
day before it was due. As a re- 
sult, he had five poems and a 
short siory to write, he had a pa- 
per to revise, and still had to 
type everything. 

"1 procrasiinated. Ihad to 
take a day off of work to give 
myself enough time to get 
everything done," Robinson ex- 
plained. 

McCanls suggested stress is a 
posilive experience for students, 
as long as il is temporary. 

Stress is anxiety, McCants ex- 
plained, diat will heighten a stu- 
dent's performance. He said 
anxiety gives energy, stamina, 
and allows students to achieve 
goals - but only if they can con- 
Uol stress. 

"Studying for exams is useful, 
especially if it is comprehen- 
sive. It is a very stimulating ex- 
perience. Students gel to see 
how all the material tits together 
through the semester," McCants 
added. 



Reklaw explodes into media frenzy 

Campus reactions mixed 



By J. William Richardson 
Managing Editor 

IPFW erupted in a firestorm 
of conUt)versy last Wednesday, 
sparked by a demonstration 
outside the Commmunicator 
office in Walb Memorial 
Union. The demons iraiors were 
taking a stand against The 
Communicator's Russ Reklaw. 

Approximately 30 demon- 
suaiors, accompanied by the 
local media and campus police, 
descended on the office around 
3 p.m. on I&gt;ec. 2 calling for the 
resignation of Jim Walker, the 
paper's editor in chief 

Fighting Ideologies Resistant 
to Equality, a feminist campus 
organization, largeied Walker 
as the ghost-writer of Reklaw's 
column, "Raw Lust," which ap- 
peared in the Nov, 19 issue of 



The Communicator, Represen- 
tatives of FIRE declined to 
comment on the demonstration. 
FIRB was recognized as an 
official campus organization 
last March and participated in a 
demonstration at the ribbon 
cutting of the new fine arts 
building. FIRE pickcicd out- 
side the facility, which was 
dedicated by Steven Beering, 
Purdue's president, at the cere- 
mony, in order to make stu- 
dents aware of the plight of ho- 
mosexuals on the IPFW cam- 
pus, 

Dorie Reynolds, publisher of 
The Communicator, thought it 
was inappropriate to comment 
at this lime.

TV-15 and WPTA-2] featured 
it as major stories on newscasts 
that evening. 

Journal-Gazelle staff writer 
Joy Tillerson listed several of 
fire's allegations against 
Walker, including one having 
Walker already being fired. 
These unsubsianiiaicd allega- 
tions were dispelled by Walker. 

"I have never been fired and 
I will not be," said Walker. "At 
The Communicator, editors 
aren't fired over conlenL" 

Tillerson quoted several pro- 
testors who said Reklaw's col- 
umn "advocates rape and ha- 
rassment of women." 

"It was not intended to pro- 
mote any type of violence," 
said Walker "It was intended to 
parody the macho, jerk kind of 
guy. It was intended to exag- 
gerate aggresive male tenden- 
cies, but ihe notion of Joking 
around about rape was never 
intended lo be included in the 
article." 

Local crime statistics have 
not shown a significant in- 
crease in rape, murder or kid- 
napping since the article. 

According to Sieve Engcl- 
man, a spokesman for the Fon 
Wayne Police Deparimcnl. 
"There definitely hasn't been 
[an increase]." 

According to Lauren Den- 
Hartog. campus chief of police, 
statistics on campus have paral- 
leled the FWPD's statistics, 

"We haven't shown any type 
of increase, " said DenHartog.

Walker some slack in her 
weekend column, 

"I have a certain amount of 
sympathy for Jim Walker," she 
said in her column. "There's al- 
ways someone who doesn't get 
the joke." 

Walker was not phased by 
the conUovcrsy. 

"I diink this was a lot of hype 
by the media and a group try- 
ing to promote themselves," 
said Walker. "I ihink it wUl all 
blow over." 

Student reaction to the article 
and the ensuing controversy 
was mixed. 

Sandra Johnson, a senior in 
secondary education was of- 
fended by the piece. 

"Anytime you print or say 
these types of things, whether ii 
is meant as satire or not," said 
Johnson, "you perpetuate and 
encourage these stereotypes or 
ideas." 

Jake Taylor, an IPFW seniw, 
saw ihe controversy iisetf as an 



alarming signal. 

"Don't these women have 
anything better to do than ha- 
rass the writer of a satire?" 
asked Taylor. 

Rajat Suri, the president of 
the student body, is philosophi- 
cal about die conflict 

"There are people screaming 
on both sides of the fence," 
said Suri. "I am not highly of- 
fended but 1 can seriously un- 
derstand the feelings of some- 
one who has been raped and 
may read this article." 

"I believe in the freedom of 
the press but I also believe in 
Ihe responsibility of the press," 
said Suri. "TTiis balance is very 
imponant in a college news- 
paper." 

"Students' government has 
not yet considered any sanc- 
tions against The Communica- 
tor, and we will not unless it is 
brought up in a meeting by a 
senator." said Suri.

He can't understand the way we 
feel — he's a big dumb sporta nuL 
He can't be sensitive, just lock at 
him. He ought to be earning a Ly- 
ing. Men can't comprehend real 
beauty, 

These are all sexisi statements. 
Soiist men might say the first few. 
And schist women often say the 
last set 

The topic of senism is often 
addressed as a women's issue. But 
it is not exclusively an issue of 
concern to women. The recent 
attacks directed at the male editor 
of this newspaper as a "sexist man 
who advocates rape and murder." 
is a fine example of sexism. If a 
woman would have been serving 
as editor when this column was 
published, what would the reac- 
tion have been? Who would the 
hatred be directed at? 

Assuming that a man is sexist 
because he is a male or because 
he happens to be heterosexual is 
completely unfair. Just as it is 
unfair and ridiculous to assume 
that a women is a bad driver, only 
because she is a woman. 

If people want equality, ihcy 
should look at individuals without 
prejudice. They should not have 
predisposed nodons about some- 
one because that person is black or 
while or brown or male or female. 
People in search of equality 



should Tirsi know the person and 
then form their opinions. But peo- 
ple are often lazy and stupid. Peo- 
ple often choose to rely on stereo- 
types for basis of judgment. And 
these are the people who need to 
stop and think about what they are 
doing. 

By looking at the editor of this 
newspaper on the basis of lazy and 
stupid stereotypes it would be easy 
to assume that he is a big dumb 
jock in a baseball cap. And by 
relying again on these stereotypes, 
it would be easy to assume that 
any sports lover is a sexist pig 
who grasps little more dian shoot- 
ing a basketball or watching the 
Bears on Sunday afternoon. The 
only man who could understand 
women's issue, by stereotype, 
would be a gay man or maybe a 
left-wing hippie polidcal acdvisL 

These stereotypes of men seem 
to be accepted notions by many of 
the people on campus who arc 
raising complaints and are claim- 
ing to seek equality. Any person 
who accepts established stereo- 
types, about men or women or 
people of race, are not seeking 
equality. They are instead seeking 
a divide, a separation of die sexes 
or races. "Men are bad and women 
arc good." they say, "Except for a 
few men who fit our positive 
stereotypes and might be okay." 

If these people can't shed their 
own sexist prejudice, maybe they 
should think twice before ques- 
tioning others on the same issue. 




Rape victim supports Editor 



By Mike Wade 
Copy Editor 
First of all, Mike is short for 
Michelc. I have finally come to 
realize diat gender matters in stat- 
ing opinions, so however wrong I 
feel it is , 1 want to make it clear I 
am female. Recently Jim Walker. 
Editor in Chief has been targeted 
as a sexist, rape promoting pig — 
he's not For all die vicdms of sex- 
ism and sexual assault. 1 want to 
tell my story. I want you to know 
that the editor of your paper is an 
outstanding person. 



Commentary 



I am a victim of sexual assaulL 
Five years ago I was beaten by a 
man who wanted me to love him. I 
was not seriously hurt, but 1 have 
since been afraid. Later I became a 
victim of date rape. I wiis not 
physically injured, but since dien I 
have had great difficulty involving 
myself in relationships with men. 

Long before die infamous Russ 
Reklaw column appeared, I con- 
fided in Jim, Jim has been an 
invaluable firicnd and confidant to 
me. He is the first and only person 
I have told who has not irmnedi- 
aiely tumed all die positive feel- 
ings he had for me into hatred for 
the attacker. Of course he would 
like to see my attacker dead, but 
he never failed to give me the sup- 
port I was so desperately search- 
ing for. Usually the people I told 
hated the attacker so much that I 
ended up consoling diem. Jim was 
the first to understand that I didn't 
need him to hate. 1 needed him to 
understand, to truly believe it 
wasn't my fault, to say diat whai- 



evirl did was O.K. 

Jim let me talk until I didn't 
need to talk anymore. He spent 
uncountable hours listening to me. 
He never got bored. He never 
became angry. He never said that I 
needed to "just get over it." He 
helped me get past die hurt, and 
more importantly, he helped mc 
get past the hatred, and to some 
extent die fear. 

I know the Russ Reklaw column 
upset a lot of people, but I also 
know Jim never meant to hurt 
anyone by running the column. 
Many people have made personal 
attacks against Jim, and I don't 
know how many times I've heard . 
"If he had ever listened to a rape 
victim,.." Well, he has listened to a 
rape victim. And 1 was not insult- 
ed by the column. I can under- 
stand everyone's concern, but I 
cannot condone the personal 
attacks. And speaking as a rape 
survivor, I would like to say: 
speak for yourself. 

I am sure that many victims 
were upset by the column, but 
many victims would be upset by 
reading a sensitive account of the 
plight of the rape victim. At least 
this one would- even more upset 
thad by reading a somewhat insen- 
sitive column intended to be 
humorous. 

Jim himself is a proponent of 
equal rights. This has been very 
difficult for me to write, and you 
must understand that for any less 
of a person I would not have put 
my life on display before you. 
There is no point to these hurtful 
and unfounded attacks on Jim's 
character.

Mixed reviews for Reklaw 

The Communicator maintains 'rape culture' 



To the Editor: 

I'm another reader who didn't think Russ Reklaw's column 
"Raw Lusi" (Nov. 19) was funny. And finding "humor" in 
that IJiUc catalog of violence isn't a moHet of being "open- 
minded enough lo understand [ficiion]," as J. William 
Richardson snarls in his Dec, 3 commentaiy. I'd say it's 
more a question of which character you identify with, die 
fictional r^ist ot the fictional rape victim. RekJaw's column 
and Richardson's editorial both leflcci a society in which 
male sexual pleasure is linked with power, violence, and 
coniemfM foi women. Ever-pieseni verbal and visual images 
of s«iiEi violence are pan of a "tape culture" in which tape 
and other forms of sexual coercion arc r»t only tolerated but 
cnL-ouraged. Women, the potential and all loo often the real 
victims of this institutionalized violence, are acting 
assertively on our own behalf when we identic so-called 
sadie like "Raw Lust" as the sewal hsassmeni it actually is. 
Wc, and the men who suppon us. can and should refuse to 
accept Ihc images of violence lowaid women as "humor." 
Do any odia readcn wonder why the editors of The Com- 
municator have reacted to women's angci hi Rekiaw's col- 
umn so defensively, and with so much Hosdlity? Can ii be 
thai they've got more invested in maintaining the rape cul- 
ture than ihey realize? 

Jeanette Clausen 
Women's Studies Director 



To the Editor: 

As a person who loves parody and who is wholeheartedly 
supportive of freedom of expression, I believe your "Date 
me if you dare" column in the Nov. 19 Communicator was 
insensitive lo the entire IPFW community. 1 have heard 
your explanation about your inieni dut it be a humorous par- 
ody in the various local news media, and as I arrived on 
campus this morning, I saw many posters suggesting thai 
people who complained about the column can't take a joke. 

You're missing the poinL 

Joking about treating a potential dale as an object isn't fun- 
ny. Joking about threats of physical violence isn't ftmny. 
Joking about ending a sexual encounter by saying "the cab's 
here bitch" isn't funny. If you have ever listened to a rape 
survivor or someone who has survived ptiysical abuse, you 
would know that this "parody" wasn't fimny. 

Obviously you intended it as a joke. Marge Schoit ^ipai- 
cnlty intended her racist, anti-Semitic comments as ftiendly, 
100. But yours wasn't a joke, and her comments waen'l 
friendly. Both were insensitive. I hope that you will consid- 
er dropping the Russ Reklaw column altogether. 

Parody is fun, 

Inscnsitivity is noL

'Date me' blown way out of proportion 



To the Editor: 

I cannot believe that people are blowing this "Russ Reklaw 
affair" out of proportion! With less than two weeks to go 
before exams, I wish 1 had entra time to waste organizing 
and publicizing a protest in ftonl of The Communicator's 
office. For you folks thai just don't get it, let me explain,.. 
Russ Reklaw is not a real per sonl Reklaw is a character 
designee! to be, for lack of a better word, scum. In past issues 
Reklaw has been portrayed as an alcoholic, chain-smoking 
di\Lg user. These previously published and equally offensive 
traits brought no grief to Mr. Walker, While Refclaw's com- 
ments from llie Nov. 19 issue were in poor taste, some of 
you folks should try to grasp the concept that Reklaw is fic- 
tional and lighten upl if you really want to fight violence 
ogainsi women, one of the last places you should be wasting 
your energy is Suite 215 of the Walb Memorial Union. 

Attention Jim Walker: Eversince Mark Snyder's incessant 
whining has diminished. Russ Reklaw is one of the few 
humorous items [eft to read every week. Please don't kill 
Russ Rcklawl My girlfriend and I find him very humorous. 
Jonathan Ormlston 
IPFW Student 



To the Editor 

This leoer is in response to the attack on Russ Reklaw and 
his "Date Me if You Dare" piece in The Communicator. I 
don't see what all the fuss is about. Males and females alike 
are in a tizzy because of this article. What is there to be so 
upset about? 

I may be one of the women on this campus who truly 
enjoyed this piece. When I first read it, I never thought 
about the promotion of rape or sexual harassment. From 
what 1 can gather. Russ Reklaw is a fictional character creat- 
ed for the sole purpose of bringing satirical humor lo our 
lives. But to call this article sexual harassment or say that it 
promotes rape is totally outrageous. One would be more 
correct to charge Pcpe LePhcw. ihe amorous skunk with sex- 
ual hanusmeni and promotion of rape. These people who 
are in such distress because of this article had better recon- 
sider what their definition of sexual harassment is, 

Jeno Putt 
rPFW Student 



Who is he? Why is he here? 



To the editor: 

I was disappointed to see what passed 
for an apology in the I&gt;ec. 3 issue of The 
Communicator. Although you claim dial 
you are not Russ Reklaw, a real person 
or persons wrote thai column. Who was 
it? 

1 was also disappointed to see the 
commentary by the managing ediior. J. 
William Richardson, claiming that 
"lunatics" who advocate censorship and 
"can'l lake b joke" were "crucifying" 
Ihe ediior in chief. 

Your apology end Richardson's com- 



menlary indicated a belief thai students 
and others who were offended by your 
column failed to understand its inten- 
tion. This slatemenl exacerbates the 
offense to women; whai you're saying is 
that we're too stupid to gel the joke. 

Mr. Walker, I am afraid thai it is you 
and your managing editor who don't get 
iL Your critics did not mistake your col- 
umn for serious opinion. They simply 
want lo point out that, whatever your 
intendons, IT WASN'T FUNNYI When 
you wrile a column you must lake 
responsibility for what you say. Criti- 



cism, however strong, is not censorship. 
If people think you we doing your job 
so badly thai you should resign, that is 
not censorship, either. It's not that we 
can't take a joke — the problem is that 
you can'l uikc the heat 

The flip side of ihc First Amendment 
is taking responsibility for what you say. 
I suggest that instead of crying "censor- 
ship" and "misundeis landing" you name 
the author of the column and respond to 
your critics like an aduli.

Humor or rape? 

Reklaw 
sends 
mixed 
signals 



To the Editor: 

1 would like to take this opportuni- 
ty to respond lo the commentaiy of 
managing editor J. William RtcKard- 
son printed in the Dec. 3 issue of 
The Communicator. This commen- 
tary defends the "Raw Lust" article 
of Russ Reklaw by pointing out that 
the Reklaw article was a "joke," and 
chacicrized anyone not able to rec- 
ognize the humor as people who 
"don't understand reality." Accord- 
ing to Mr, Richanlson. "fact occurs", 
"fiction is informative and entertain- 
ing", and "unders landing this differ- 
ance is essential to existing in the 
modem age." 

Unfortunaiely, one of the facts of 
life is that 



LeHer 
Of The 
Week 



women are 
subjected to 
aggressive 
behavior such 
as described 
in the Reklaw 
article. At a 
time when 
date rape is acknowledged to be a 
serious problem on college campus- 
es (as well as elsewhere), the 
Reklaw article seems to not only 
condone such action, but actually 
encourage it. The fear that women 
feel should not be trivialized by a 
"humorous" article such as Ihe 
Reklaw one. 

If the Reklaw article was a satire, 
it seems to have fallen short of its 
goal. Of all the people who read this 
article, it is interesting that not one 
of them laughed. Further, it was my 
impression thai satire was meant to 
attack and/or deride human vice. 
However, the fictional Reklaw char- 
acter not only receives gratification 
through his actions, but seems lo 
suffer no repercussions from them. 

Even though I understood thai this 
article was intended lo be funny 
when I read it. I was concerned that 
not everyone who would read il 
would understand that it was humor. 
Mr. Richardson even slated in his 
commentary that "many of The 
Communicator's readers fail to see 
this reality line." Can we assume 
that only radical feminists misunder- 
stood this article? Isn't il also possi- 
ble that a person with enough physi- 
cal screngib and mental instability to 
actually commit a date rape could 
have also misunderstood ihe Reklaw 
anicle? 

While 1 have no desire to see a fic- 
tional character and his ediior in 
chief be "crucified for the sins of 
society". 1 would simply prefer thai 
the same fictional character and his 
editor in chief not be proponents of 
those sins. 

It seems ironic lo me that the 
Reklaw article is being defended in 
the same issue of The Communica- 
tor where there appears a major arti- 
cle on the prevalence of racism, with 
the primary complaint being ethnic 
jokes. It would seem that humor 
depends upon one's perspective. Is il 
really giving in to censorship, or 
bowing to "political correctness", to 
print articles which do not target any 
particular group for humor? Or 
would il be simple decency?

cinctly iJlustraied when he smashed

So, not wanting to get into a

would write about holidays, but try 
to say something that's only been

way of celebrating any 
occasion that funnels 
tons of cash into the 
toy, candy, liquor, in- 
cendiary, flower, or 
plastic Jesus indus- 
tries. 

Of course, the 
grandaddy of all holi- 
day seasons is upon 
us. The Christ- 
mas/New Year's/ 
Bowl Games season is 
winding down to that 
frenzied climax of 
family, food, cam- 
corders and manufactured fun. 

Some people may think I'm being 
politically incorrect in calling it the 
Christmas season, indicating a bias 
toward Christianity, but this is not 
the case. Christmas, as the social 
and economic climax of the year, 
transcends all religious borders. 
There are huge chunks of our Amer- 
ican Christmas Traditions Uiat have 



been evolving for millions of years 
to adapt to freezing cold winters and 
we set it up in our house next lo a 
blazing hot fireplace. We set the 
tree up to a lame life-support system 
(a dish filled widi water) and keep it 
alive so wc can decorate it in bright 
ilickering lights, glass spheres, and 
plastic angels. 

The tree probably feels like a dog 
that has been shoved into a dress 
and forced to walk on its hind legs, 
with those pitiful puppy dog eyes 
that say "I feel like a moron" and all 
(he while the human owner is blub- 
bering about how "precious" the 
dog looks. 

And when we're done with the 
tree we lake off its silly iree cos- 
tume, carefully placing the costume 
in boxes, disconnect ils life support, 
and leave it for dead on the sidc.of 
theioad. 

And my point is, you don't have lo 
be a practicing Christian to abuse 
trees during Chrislmas, 

Soon many of you will be gather- 
ing with your extended families and 



engaging in the Required Conver- 
salional Small Talk Ritual (RC- 
STR.) This is done when you gel 
together widi distant relatives whom 
you sec annually and review the fol- 
lowing information: 1) How you are 
doing, 2) Where you arc living. 3) 
What you arc doing. 4) What your 
cuneni theories on the metaphysical 
nature of life arc. 

While one person is updating his 
or her life from the last RCSTR, the 
second person, or the Inquisitor, 
wUI display the Seriously Interested 
Look while nodding frequently. 

While the collection of RCSTRs 
are going on, Ihcrc is the requisite 
Camcorder Uncle, who wants lo 
record every possible moment of 
every possible encounter between 
every possible combination of 
relatives. 

In my family, my dad is the Cam- 
corder Uncle, and he takes his job 
very' seriously. While camera tt\ 
sits on a tripod focused on the main 
tabic (accompanied by the natural 
1000 wait lighi blinding everyone in

who is also his wife, scurry about 
with various still cameras and cam- 
corders, capturing the holiday fun of 
people suddenly betoming very qui- 
et in the presence of a camera. 

But it is nice to know that after we 
have tortured our trees, conversed 



with our distant relatives, and 
watched the Big Ten champions gel 
the crap beat out of them under the 
blazing hoi January southern Cali- 
fornia sun in the Rose Bowl, we

Reklaw dead and buried; foul play suspected 



By Jim Walker 
Editor In Chief 
A giant cloud or cigarette smoke 
hung over the group of moumcrs. 
Dressed all in blaclt. the sobbing 
crowd watched the body of Russ 
Reklaw disappear for good into the 
fresh grave, 

Reklaw. 32, was buried in the 
Highway 69 Off-Ramp Graveyard 
yesterday afternoon. 

Reklaw died early Sunday morn- 
ing of complicaiions from the surgery 
last week 10 remove four bullets from 
his body. 

According to Rcklaw's personal 
surgeon. Dr. Charles Stenkenlikgen. 
several of Reklaw's imponani inter- 
nal organs were inadverienily 
removed. SienJtenlikgcn said that a 
Qistodian who cleaned up the opcrai- 
ijig room the nighi of Reklaw's 
surgery found one of Reklaw's lungs 
and his liver under a can. 

"Sorry, okay?" Sienkcnlikgen said 
today. "I was a liiUe under the weath- 
er, if you know what 1 mean, when I 
did the operation. Sometimes you 
swing and miss. They can't all be 
home runs. We can't all be Dr. Dean 
Edell." 

When asked if he feared a mal- 
practice suit Stenkenlikgen said, 
"Who is going to sue me? Ru&amp;s was a 
fictional character. They don't offer 
legal protection to Hciional charac- 
ters. What, are you crazy?" 

Reklaw fans, including some at 
the burial T\iesday afternoon, bebeve 
Stenkenlikgen is lying. They say 
Reklaw's death was not just from 
complications of last week's shoot- 
ing, but also as a result of foul play. 

"Somebody got lo Russ and did 
him," noted Reklaw confidant Babs 
Louis. "I saw him the other day Mid 
he was doing good. Somebody got to 
him." 

Police deny any further foul play. 
They also say Stenkenlikgen will noi 
beheld responsible. 
I Police are still holding Patsy Gul- 
let, of Lot 37, Easy Breeze Ttailer 
ftirk in Fort Wayne, on preliminary 
charges of lira degree murder. Gullet 
continues 10 deny any involvement in 
Reklaw's death. 

Gullet's lawyer, Wease Snow, says 
Reklaw was hit again after checking 



into the Budget Community Hospital 
last week. He believes hospital offi- 
cials and police arc covering this up 
so they can pin it All on his client. 

"I spoke with Reklaw last week. 
He was alive. He said he was feeling 
okay. And when 1 told hmi who I was 
he told me. in no uncertain terms, lo 
stick a hghi pole up my ass. This was 
not a dying man in my opinion," 
Snow said. 

Larry Alhiian, a spokesperson for 
Budget Hospital said Snow's charges 
were bogus. "A lot of people die here 
and we have never tried to hide thai. 
A bunch of people died here today. 
One guy died from a sprained ankle. 
This other lady was having a wart 
removed from her hand — dropped 
dead as a door stop," Allman said. 

"If Reklaw had died because 
somebody came in and stabbed him 
with a knife or prui a big, fluffy pillow 
over his face and held it there unul he 
suffocated in a violent and painful 
death, we would have released a 
statemeni to that effect," continued 
Alltnan. 

A local private detective, and a 
small group of Reklaw fans have 
another idea on the death of the con- 
troversial columnist. 

Brick Batton, a local licensed pri- 
vate detective, says he thinks Reklaw 
is still alive, Banon said he has been 
reading Reklaw's columns for a while 
and he was intrigued by the contro- 
versy and then the shooting. 

Ballon said he heard Reklaw had 
died mysteriously, and decided to 
investigate. Batton said he is working 
on his own and thai he was not hired 
10 investigate Reklaw's death. 

Batton uncovered some bizarre 
facts about Reklaw's death, Oddly 



enough. Batton said Rcklaw's middle 
name was misspelled on his tomb 
stone. Instead of spelling his middle 
name "Aron" as it appears on his 
birth certificate and Sears charge 
card, the stone engraving read "Rus- 
sell Aaiun Reklaw." 

Also, the funeral for Reklaw svas 
closed casket. According to Batton. 
one of the pallbearers, oddly enough 
named Paul Bcaier, told the detective, 
The casket was really light. Just like 
nobody was in it or sometoig," 

Batton believes Reklaw may not 
be dead at all. Batton said he thinks 
Reklaw was taken from the hospital 
on the sly and put on a jet to some- 
where far away, quite possibly Iran — 
a place where Reklaw has always 
warned to live, according to Baiton's 
sources. 

In addition to Batton, another 
group of Reklaw fans beheve him to 
be alive. "We saw him leave the hos- 
pital, man. And then he was ai Rally's 
geiiin' fries," noted a wino drifter and 
Reklaw fan. 

A group of Reklaw fans have 
organized a club called the Bastard 
Sons of Reklaw. They don't buy the 
story of Reklaw's death. "Russ will 
return. He wouldn't die. He couldn't 
do that to us. There is no way. I'll 
never except it. Plus. I think I saw 
him last night ai the Dairy Queen." 
one of the Bastard Sons sobbed. 

This paper has received notifica- 
tion of several sightings of Russ 
around Fort Wayne since his burial. 
He has been supposedly spoiled at 
Brandy's Lounge, The Holiday Inn. 
The Gap, Kettler Hall, the Gateway 
Theater, Powers Hamburgers, J.C. 
Penny's and Pier One Imports, 

None of the sightings have been 



verified. 

Most people are satisfied that 
Reklaw is a dead dog. There is no 
doubt that my patient is a dead man. I 
held his lifeless arm and checked his 
pulse — nada," noted Stenkenlikgen. 

Others in the community seemed 
son of pleased about Reklaw's 
untimely demise. And secure that he 
was a goner. "I danced on his grave 
all day today," noted Tirey Irons, a 
Reklaw hater and member of RIDD, 
Ruis Is EJead— Delightful!. 

"I saw them lower him into the 
grave and then I spit on his casket, I 
have no doubt that the asshole is 
dead." continued Irons. She said she 
was listening lo Sinhead O'Cormor 
on her Discman while doing her cele- 
brational death dance. 

A spokesperson for The Cotnmu- 
nicaior said Russ Reklaw is dead. 
"We don't expect any columns from 
him now. He is dead as far as we are 
concerned. And we ain't too pleased 
about it because now we have to find 
another way to fill space at the last 
minute. Maybe we can just continue 
writing these nutty fake news

Gift of learning 

Teacher helps dying man 



By Mary Shrock 
Fealura Editor 

Two wcclts in Jamaica, perhaps a 
big, floppy ircc and loads of glisten- 
ing gifts may mean Christmas for 
some people, bui one teacher at 

IPFW has given a gifi more valuable because his English 
than any monetary one. She has limited ii is necessary for Kl: 
shared her love 



Two hours a week KJaimin works 
with an Hispanic man who has a life 
(hrutening illness. 

According lo Klaiman the man 
wa.s bom in Mexico bui is now a cit- 
izen of the United Slates. However, 




&gt; bf\ l 



learning. 

Mimi Klaiman, an 
assistant professor of 
linguistics at IPFW 
since August, decided 
she wanted to share 
her gift of language 
and help someone in 
need at the same time. 

While Klaiman was 
in Fon Wayne for her 
interview ni IPFW she 



the newspaper about a 
volunteer group called 
Visiting Nurse Service and Hospice 
Inc. Hospice, as it is simply called, 
provides care for terminally ill pa- 
tients, 

"Hospice can be errand-type help, 
but also it gives companionship to 
these people," Klaiman said. 

So when she relumed after accept- 
ing a position ai IPFW Klaiman de- 
cided lo get involved as a Hospice 
volunteer. 

"I've volunteered in nursing 
homes but I wanted to fio on lo more 



Prof-file 



communicate with him 
in Spanish. 

"They assigned me to 
this patient because no 
one else could speak 
Spanish." Klaiman said. 
Klaiman said her pa- 
tient wants to write a 
book about his struggles 
with the illness and 
share his experience 
with others. 

"i told him you can't 
think of it as one long 
book, but think of it as 
eight long tcmi papers. 
That's how you do it." Klaiman said. 
Sounds like something a typical 
teacher might say, but unlike many 
individuals, Klaiman doesn't stop 
sharing when her classroom door 
shuts. 

Klaiman has reached beyond her 
own language and culture and has 
touched one person in the deepest 
way possible. She has given herself 
and her time - perhaps one of the 
most precious gifts, 
"I'ye found a lot of reward ' 



chflllcnging work. Something with both volunteering and teaching," 



is to it," Klaiman said.
