Weber. PFW students are charited for parkine under

Denhartog added that now there

over- abundance of vehicles on the 
south end of campus is nol as bad as 
in post semesters, 

"Students warn to park at the

Al the end of the day though, 
ue could all use a break. This is 
where the IPFW Greek Society 
comes in. Wth two sororities and 
two fiatemiiies. there is plenty to

Greek societies have been

Shubitha Kevor also acknowledged 
the academic incentive. She said

There is no belter way lo make
