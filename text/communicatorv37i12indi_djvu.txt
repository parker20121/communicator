Woodard spoke about how our country and our world should focus on peace between nations and helping our communities. 



Alfre Woodard. a four-lime Emmy 
Award-winning actress and political 
activist in the United Slates and Africa, 
spoke of the importance of unity aspjrt 
oflPFW's Omnibus Lecture Series. 

Woodard, who's film and television 
credentials include "Desperate House- 
wives." "Beauty Shop," "Dinosaur" 
and "The Wild Thornberry 's Movie," 
appeared on Monday, Nov. 13 in the 
Walb Ballroom to take pan in the lec- 



ture series, which is funded by a grant 
from the English. Bonter, Mitchell 
Foundation. 

Woodard reminisced about how, on 
9/11, she did not see "Hollywood's por- 
trayal of America." Instead, Woodard 
said she saw the "real America," built 
from all different colors and minori- 

"This is the America that was seen 
throughout the streets of America after 
the terrorist attacks on the World Trade 
Centers," said Woodard, "I have never 



you were. Everyone was hurt in some 
way and everyone helped out everyone 
else." Woodard continued. 

Another point Woodard hit on was 
the American flag's role during Ameri- 
ca's "grieving lime." The flag not only 
represented unity, but also represented 
identity.

for their government's actions. 

"The cycle of vengeance must be 
broken if we are to ever live a day of 
peace," said Woodard "Security is like- 
peace: it has to be created." 

Woodard encouraged Americans lu 
come together and be good neighbors. 
She suggested that as a country. Amer- 
ica should give money and resources to 
other nations and work on building rclj- 
tionships. instead of retaliating with war 
and firepower. 

"It was a blow that could have 
brought us to our knees, but we will let 
it bring us to our feet." said Woodard.

Homecoming Festivities Bring Back Spirit 



As we prepare for the annual tradi- 
tion of homecoming, scheduled for the 
week of Nov. 13-19, question* about 
this yearly ritual once again arise. 

Who is coming home on this par- 
ticular week, and from where? 

Since it usually culminates in 
a football game, is it the football 
team or former players? 

Well, alumni can come to any 
home game, so perhaps it is safe 
to assume thai homecoming is the 
first home game of the year. 

However, this tradition does 
not always revolve around foot- _ 
ball, since IPFW does not yet have 
a football team, our celebration is for 
the men's basketball team. 

It seems as though the tradition of 
homecoming is near and dear to the 
hearts of the past and current students 
of a school. 

Much energy and creativity is 
spent in planning and presenting these 
festivities, and so perhaps a closer 
look at this tradition is warranted. 



A quick visit to Wikipedia reveals 
that '"the first ever homecoming was 
born at Baylor University in Waco, 
Texas in 1909. 

Graduates of the university re- 
lived a postcard signed by three

and friendships, and catch the Baylor 
spirit again." 

Typically, there are certain events 
which arc part of the tradition of 
homecoming. 

A queen-and sometimes a king 
too-are crowned by former queens 
and kings or by a favorite professor. 

A parade is held in many of these 
celebrations, as arc rallies with Pon- 



tile homecoming game opponent are 
burned) and formal or semi-formal 
dances. 

The centerpiece of the festivities is 
the "big game." This game is usually 
football, but smaller schools will tra- 
ditionally substitute a gridiron contest 

with either a basketball or hockey 

game or a banquet.

Those Who Don't Vote 
Shouldn't Complain 



By Matt Middle tort 

I cannot count how many times 
I have heard people of all ages say, 
"See? This is why I don't vote." It 
is a phrase that stings my ears every 
time I hear it. How can a society thai 
is so blessed with health and wealth 
be so unwise? People all over the 
world regularly sacrifice their lives to 
gain the same rights that we Amcri- 

Do people not care about the is- 
sues? It can't be . Everyone has 
opinions about everything, and non- 
voters complain about problems in 
the world just as loud as voters. So 
't they try to change it? Per- 



But one thing iliai can be said for sure 
is that when the public as a whole 
speaks, politicians listen. 

There is no better example of this 
than the mid-term elections. There is 
still a very solid, conservative Repub- 
lican core that voted in large numbers 
in support of their party. But moder- 
ate Americans swung io the left and 
showed the 1 1 disapproval of a poorly- 
nuriLsiialcd war and a detached ad

Perhaps, as our nation grew and 
became more prosperous, people be- 
gan to feel more removed from their 
government. Let's face it, peoples' 
voles counted a lot more when the 
country had five million people rather 
than 300 million With a low popula- 
tion, citizens may have felt that they 
had more of a personal stake in the 
government. Plus, people feel (hat 
politicians are more inclined to lisien

I admit that it can be madden- 
ing tn listen to (he evening news at 
times-actually most of the time. Al- 
most every story is about some sort 
of horrible problem and how govem-

The election's results were the 

driving force behind the ousting of 
Secretary of Defense Donald Rums-

Rumsfeld had the President's lull 
support until the day after the elec- 
tion and an apparent reevaluaiion ot 
a siagnani war thai just a week earlier

Why don't many American citi-

Historical Secrets Uncovered in 
Basement of Helmke Library 



By Louisa Danielson

What do you think of when you 
hear Ihe word secret' 1 Christmas pres- 
ents? 1942 nuclear tests in Chicago? 
Roswcll? 

How about Helmke Library? 

Yes, Helmke Library holds secrets. 

it you walk straight down the hall- 
way in the basement of Helmke. right 
after you exit the elevator, you will 
probably wandet pasi several offices 

You'll also pass a room wilh banks 
of lelcvisions. and blank, gray walls. 
But what will really catch your eye is 
the vintage lighting on the wall - the 



Vintage? Ancient is more like it. 
What is vintage lighting doing in one 
of the technology centers of 1PFW? 

According to Bernard Lolunuller, 
director of the College Cable Access 
Center, the old lighting is a holdover 
from earlier times, when there was a 









i studio. WII'LJ was tlu 
t WBNI/WBOl, thepuh 

inn here in nnnlna-ini 






. in-lulled i 



1978. 

If you walk into room B48, where 
the studio was located, you'll lind that 
there are four interior, closed rooms 
- each with a little On Air' sign above 
their own doors. 

"[The on-air lights] would trip on 



when the mic was 

The radio station remained in the 
basement of Helmke until 1982, when 
the studio was flooded out. 

The station was then off the air fur 
a period before it later relocated and 
became the WBNI'WBOI station that 

Since that time, Helmke Library 
has had several renovations. In 1991, 
the master control room was rebuilt 
and removed, and in 2000. the studio 

Those old lights arc just souvenirs. 
They don't even work anymore -when 
the mics were taken out ot the studios, 
ihc lights were disconnected. 

But they sure arc neat to look at. 
And someday, who knows? They 
might just goon again. 



iminalion of all kinds has been 
for a very long time. While 
ve been vast improvements 
in some areas, others have remained 
stagnant. 

The Civil Rights Movement was 
over forty years ago, and women's 
rights were right behind. On paper it 
may seem that everything is equal; 
however, if you look around, its obvious 
thai equality has uuiie a ways logo. 

Being a while female, I am not 
going to discuss race discrimination. 
Although there have been moments in 
which I have been treated unfairly due 
to my race. I feel I can say much more 
about discrimination because of my 
gender. 

I think that when women arc the 
subjects of discrimination, we may 



ibea 



col It 1 V 



of many of the issues 1 faced before 1 
took a women's studies course here on 
campus. 

In that class. 1 learned to really 
appreciate the opportunities I have now, 
hut also to stand up tm I lie opportunities 
that have sij|| not been granted. 

There are also so many false 
stereotypes tor women today concerning 
what we can and cannot do. I have not 
been chosen lor certain jobs because 
it was assumed that I was too weak. 
I have also been asked to perform 
cleaning duties ai my jobs, because-as 



iold-\ 



heller ; 



discriminated used ti 



kind of thing, 
Not only 
againsi by men, but women are also 

discriminated against by other women. 

I understand this situation if we are 
talking about modeling, or if it is an 
advertising issue But other than that, it 
is unfair to deny a person a job because 
ot iheu appearance. 

I worked somewhere that needed 
to hire more employees. A woman 
who had more qualifications than 
some current employees came in and 



interviewed, but was turned down. 
Many of the employees, including 
myself, wondered why she was not 
hired. When we asked our manager 
why she wasn't chosen for the job. 
we were told, "well, she just wasn't 
pretty enough." Did I mention that this 
manager was a woman? 

I think the accomplishments that 
women before us have made are 
wonderful, but I am not satisfied. If 1 
have a daughter, I don't want her to be 
told to play "girl games.'' I don't want 
her to think that she should not like 
sports because they are something that 
boys like. 

If she wants to grow up to be a 
basketball player, I don't want her to 
think that it can't happen. I want for her 
what our mothers wanted for US. 

Each generation of women have 
better chances than the generation 
before them of accomplishing what 
they want to do. But is that enough? 

Women still do not get paid the 
same amount of money as men for 
doing the same job with the same level 
of experience. I do not want women to 
be denied opportunities just because 
they arc women. But I also don't want 
women to get jobs just because they 
are women. Jobs should be given to 
those who deserve them, regardless of 
gender. 

I do not know if complete gender 
equality will be achieved, because there 
may always be those few who are set in 
their ways. But there can be changes. 

I will no longer accept treatment 

I know is wrong just because I am 



I encourage any woman who may 
be thinking of a moment in which they 
have tclt discriminated against to speak 
up. If you don't, there will be another 
woman right behind you who will 
experience the same thing. 

This pattern of inequality will 
remain an endless cycle if no one 
speaks up. 

Unlike some popular opinions, a 
woman should not wait to speak until 
spoken to. We should speak as soon as

who were com ictcd and placed on death row and 
served time for someone else's crime. 

Socially relevant, it's about ordinary people 
caught in a nightmare where justice and jurispru-

A play that could easily be about anger and
