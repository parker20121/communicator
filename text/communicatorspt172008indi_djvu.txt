Lany people 
may be wondering why 
some syllabi this semes- 
ter show plus and minus 
grades. For those return- 
ing lo campus, ii might 
be a signiticam change. 
For those who are fresh- 
men, it might not be dif- 



ferent from high school 
grades at ali. Stili. reiurti- 
ing students are left 
dering - why a new grading 
scale now? 

This summer, old com- 
pute r syste ms were random- 
ly replaced at Purdue and 
new software called Ban- 



by 
Purdue 
ner went Univer- 

live in July, sity; there- 

which is why the grading fore, all changes made to 
s&gt;'Stem has finally been their computer systems 
implemented. This is im- will affect IPFW stu- 
portani because IPFW is dents. 



It is also not sur- 
prising the motion was 
passed in 1997 to add 
plus minus grading, but 
it's just now taking effect 
here on campus. 

Purdue University 
Registrar Roben Kubat 
said, "When the policy 



was passed m 1997, ihe 
computer system did not 
have the funcdonality loj 
implement the plus and' 
minus grading system.'

Sparks fly at State Legislative 
Immigration Study hearing 



The President Speaks 

Voicing your IPFW thoughts 



By Kody Tinnel 

iluprei6iphv.edu 



By Dan iehl 

SUltWfiltr 



On Sept. 9. in an 
overflowing Indianapo- 
lis Stale Capilol hearing 
room, sparks were fly- 
ing. The Indiana Interim 
Study Commiiiee on Im- 
migration argued, not 
among themselves, but 
with the best and the 
brightest law school pro- 
Tessors in the state of In- 
diana. 

When committee 
members heard their 
invited "experis" testify 
at a public hearing that 
Indiana should not pass 
immigration legislation, 
some of the members 
unleashed a volley of re- 
marks against some very 
renowned, distinguished, 
published, and polished 
experts on the subject. 

During this past 2008 
Indiana legislative ses- 
sion, both the State 
Senate and the General 
Assembly passed im- 
migration bills. The two 
versions landed in a 
conference committee 
which voted to establish 
a study committee rather 
than pass a law. Botli bills 
proposed to make it il- 
legal by stale law for em- 
ployers to hire undocu- 
mented immigrants and 
proposed to strengthen 
the authority of local law 



enforcement to punish 
violating employers. 

Many opposed the 
bills by arguing that the 
victims would be em- 
ployers and legal immi- 
grants, further arguing 
the federal government, 
not the states, has juris- 
diction on immigration 
matters. 

The Sept. 9 hearing 
was the first of five to be 
held this fall with one 
to be scheduled some- 
where in Northern Indi- 
ana. Presenters for this 
first hearing were by in- 



fessor of Law at Indiana 
University School of Law 
in Indianapolis. Only Hill 
expressed support to the 
committee in enacting 
some form of state immi- 
gration legislation. 

Valparaiso School of 
Law professor, Bernard 
TVujillo, expressed the 
bottom line to three of the 
four law school professors. 
"The federal government 
has exclusive jurisdiction 
on immigration law." 

Professor of Law at In- 
diana University School of 
Law in Indianapolis, Kelly

vitation only. 

The guest presenters 
were heavy hitters: 
Professor lohnScanlon, 
Law Professor at Indi- 
ana University School 
of Law in Bloomington 
and in his 25th year of 
teaching, researching 
and publishing on con- 
stitutional law; Linda 
Kelly Hill, Professor of 
Law at Indiana Univer- 
sity School of Law in 
Indianapolis; Bernard 
TVujillo, Professor of 
Law from the Valparai- 
so University School of 
Law. and John Hill, Pro- 



Hill, described the Indiana 
proposed bills that were 
not passed as, "(The bills) 
reflecting no understand- 
ing of federal immigration 
law." 

Sen. Mike Delph (R-Car- 
mel) challenged the law 
professors. "My consdtu- 
ents are tired of illegal im- 
migrants using resources 
and costing the taxpayer 
money," said Delph. 

"Thank you for recog- 
nizing the role and proper 
authority of the U.S. Con- 
stitudon," Hill concluded. 

Delph challenged her 
criticism of the Indiana 



bills and her criticism 
citing die unreliabilitj' 
of the federal E-Verifica- 
lion system, required by 
federal law to be used by 
businesses to verify em- 
ployee eligibility. Hill had 
said the error rates in the 
system make it unreli- 
able. 

States have been 
testing the waters on en- 
acting state immigration 
laws since the 1986 Im- 
migration Reform and 
Control Act introduced 
by President Ronald Rea- 
gan. This act requires 
the infamous I-9's to be 
completed for identifi- 
cation purposes when 
anyone begins a new job. 
This act also provides for 
the states as an option to 
enact business-related 
immigration provisions 
relative to illegal immi- 
gration. 

The handful of state 
laws passed has been 
challenged. The consti- 
tutionality of t\vo recent 
slate laws, Pennsylvania 
and Arizona, will soon 
be determined by federal 
courts. 

TVujillo cited the costs 
to taxpayers of not wait- 
ing until these cases are 
decided. "We're in a po- 
sition to learn from the 
mistakes of others. " He 
said.

Starling at the end of 
this month a new face will 
be part of the IPSGA of- 
fice. Our current Student 
Government Coordina- 
tor DaniWiizigreuter will 
be taking the next step 
in her career path as the 
Tide III Director at Indi- 
ana Tech. The difficult 
job of filling her shoes 
for the remainder of this 
year has been granted 
to Suzanne Chalmers. 
She will lake over as the 
Interim Advisor for Stu- 
dent Government, start- 
ing September 29, until a 
permanent replacement 
is found next spring. 

The Student Govern- 
ment Coordinator posi- 
tion was formed about 
five years ago for the 
purpose of advising all 
of IPSGA and making 
sure that student leaders 
received the staff assis- 
tance that they deserved 
and needed in order to 
advance the perspectives 
and goals of the student 
body. The Coordinator 



has become a very im- 
ponant aspect of Student 
Government and all of its 
many functions. 

Suzanne has been 
highly involved on cam- 
pus. She previously 
served as the Student 
Mentoring Program Co- 
ordinalor, as an Ambas- 
sadon, and as a member 
of the Student Activities 
Board. This is her tliird 
year at IPFW working to- 
ward a Bachelor's Degree 
in Business. She hopes to 
continue on with the ex- 
cellent service that Dani 
has given while putting 
her own spin on the po- 
sition. 

On behalf of IPSGA 
and the st\ident body as 
a whole i would like to 
thank Dani Witzigreuter 
for all of the hard work 
she has put in for Stu- 
dent Government in re- 
cent years. She has done 
an amazing job and I am 
sure Indiana Tech will be 
gready satisfied with her 
services. I would also like 
to warmly welcome Su- 
zanne to the position. I 
have no doubt that she 
viill do a fantastic job 
and ensure that Student 
Government continues 
to serve IPFW to the best 
of its abilities. 

Student Body President, 
Kody Tinnel

citizens best mentally 
and physically equipped 
to be aclive in the politi- 
cal processes of our de- 
mocracy, as of late, they 
have become its worst 
enemy: political couch 
potatoes. 

Our Constitution, Bill 
of Rights, and bodyoflaw 
guarantee us many in- 
dividual and group free- 
doms including of those 
of press, speech, assem- 
bly, privacy, voting, reli- 
gion, etc. Only a minority 
of people on this planet 
enjoy such rights. 

We in die U.S. are 
among the lucky few. 

But ivith this luck 
comes a responsibility to 
protect these freedoms 
and extend them to oth- 



Conirary to what the 
right wing ideologues 
and Hollywood moguls 
would have us believe, 
freedoms are most often 
threatened not by for- 
eign invaders, but from 
within, by lazy citizens. 
The dregs of society tak- 
ing advantage of the 
good nature and good- 
wiU of the government 
they helped set up. 



(or, even worse, not voic- 
ing an opinion) on the 
important issues of our 
day, we do a disservice lo 
the population impacted 
negatively by the issue, to 
our own consciences and 
to the freedoms we take 
for granted as an integral 
part of our free country. 

We basically let oth- 
ers win by holding back. 
When people do not 



"They have had the greatest 

advantage our society 
offers: the advantage of an 

education." 



And freedoms are not 
usually extended to oth- 
ers by bloody wars for 
democracy, but by edu- 
cation and grassroots 
empowerment. The 

greatest sin in the politi- 
cal world, then, it seems, 
is the citizen's, who hav- 
ing freedom chooses not 
to use it. 

By not taking action 



heed the call of change 
in our present democrat- 
ic government, we let the 
opposing side win and let 
an almost authoritarian 
ideology reign supreme. 
Much like Nazi Germany 
oftlie 1930'sand40's, 

It is never the majori- 
ty that develops and pro- 
motes a new idea leading 
to human advancement. 



but a minority or a single 
individual. As Hunter S. 
Thompson said, "When 
the going gets weird, the 
weird turn pro". 

When lazy citizens 
choose to remain uned- 
ucated on current events 
and issues, those with 
money harness their 
political power by using 
flashy advertisements 
and other manipulations 
of the media to hook 
them into acting against 
their own and society's 
best interests. 

This not only lakes 
away from our liberties. 
but it starts the country 
in a dovvnward spiral. 

It is up to the students 
of today to take the lead 
in our participatory de- 
mocracy. They have had 
the greatest advantage 
our societ&gt;' offers: the ad- 
vantage of an education. 

Students not only 
have the education, but 
also the energy and the 
opponunity to make 
these important and nec- 
essary changes. They will 




one day have the most 
influence, becoming the 
leaders of tomorrow. 

They, for the most 
part, also have the advan- 
tage of not yet having the 
entanglements of more 
established individuals: 
family, mortgage, car 
payments, and job secu- 
rity to force them to com- 
promise their principles, 
or materialistic greed to 
cloud their consciences. 

It is up to our edu- 
cated, forward thinking, 



idealistic and energetic 
students to provide the 
impetus for change. 

Realize, students, you 
have no magical remote 
control to change the 
channels. If you want to 
stop watching the spread 
of poverty, pollution and 
repression in this coun- 
try and around the world, 
get up off your butts and 
change the channel to 
peace, prosperity and 
environmental responsi- 
bility.

The Top 10 

Money - Saving Tips for College Students 

10. While most foreign language textbooks cost over 
$100, a few are pretty cheap: Australian, Irish, Alas- 
kan... 

9. Why buy an air heshener for your dorm room when 
you can just eat a Tic Tac and hyperventilate? 

8. Starbucks is pretty expensive. Instead try new Mocha 
Latte Kool-Aid! 

7. When you're at a night club, you can get drinks for 
h-ee if you wear a short skirt and a low- cut top. This can 
also get you better grades. 

6. Feel like a snack? Hamburger Helper tastes just as 
good with chicken, tuna, or cat food. 

5. Speaking of food, all the desks on campus come with 
h-eegum! 

4. Need to look good for a job interview? Instead of get- 
ting all your teeth whitened, just paint one black. 

3. Instead of paying for a class, offer to trade your pro- 
fessor something of equal value like afoot massage. 

2. Save money on your water bill by cleaning yourself 
like a cat. Ask your roommate for help. 

1. Want a free diploma? Just go dumpster diving be- 
hind any retail chain. (Look under the pile of broken 
dreams.) 



From Page 3 



If the courts rule in 
favor of these stales, il 
will "create a mosaic of a 
mess." 

Tniijillo added rather 
bluntly: "Ii's not permis- 
sible or prudent for the 
Slates to take federal law 
into its own hands." 

Only Professor John 
Hill thought that a nar- 
row employment-busi- 



ness slate law may sur- 
vive court scrutiny prior 
to the resolution of the 
Arizona and Pennsylva- 
nia court decisions. 

One frustrated com- 
mittee member asked: 
"Is there an end to this or 
a solution?" 

The elder statesman 
from lU-Bloominglon 
Professor, John Scan- 



lon summed it up with 
a statement all four law 
professors agreed upon. 
"There are two op- 
tions. You can push youi 
authority given consti- 
tutional law and hops 
for the best; or (you can) 
explore comprehen- 
sive analysis and refonr 
of federal immigration 
laws."

"You're in for a great treat 
tonight." 

Munoz took the podium, 

sending the orchestra 

into a vigorous rendition 

h o w of Bemsetin's "Overture 

you set to Candide." Like a tune 

up an from Disney's Fantasia, 

the orchestra created 

a peppy melody in the 

flutes and piccolos that 

smoothly transitioned 

into a siring song. 

From dien on, the or- 
chestra played number 
after number of what Mu- 
noz called "greatest hits 
for classical music." 
Munoz led the orchestra 
through the Overture to 
Mozart's "The Marriage of 
Figaro,""Bizet's Suite No. 1 
from Carmen, the Rossini 
Overture to "The Barber 
of Seville," the very famil- 
iar Sirauss' "On the Beau-

The Pulse Smartpen: 

Changing how we sit/sleep/doodle through lectures 



By Mark Cox 

513 H Writer 

Ever find yourself 
in a lecture and missing 
half of what the professor 
says? Do you ever wish 
you could fill the gaps 
and never miss a word 
again? Whether you write 
slow, have a wandering 
mind, or have your own 
form of hieroglyphics, 
the new Pulse Smartpen 
may be your solution to 
lectures. Manufactured 
by a neiv company called 
LiveScribe. not only is 
the pen capable of re- 
cording lectures with this 
high tech device, but also 
keeps what is being writ- 
ten synchronized with 
what is being recorded, 
as lo return to a certain 
point in your notes at any 
time. 

Voice is recorded through 
dual mono recording mi- 
crophones located on the 
pen, which works hand- 
in -hand to catch every 
word and can be replayed 
through a small speaker 
on die pen or through 
included headphones. 
Weighingonly 1.3 ounces, 
the pen is housed in an 
ergonomic anodized alu- 
minum case and is about 
the size of a permanent 
marker. 



T\vo versions of the pen 
are available: die 1GB 
model (over 100 hoiurs of 
recording time) retails 
for $149, wfiiles the 2GB 
model (over 200 hours of 
recording time) retails 
for SI99. The accesso- 
ries in this package in- 
clude a 100-sheet col- 
lege-ruled notebook, a 
case, three black line 
point ink cartridges, 
and headphones. 

Desktop software 
is also included 
with the Smartpen, 
which allows you lo 
view pages and re- , 
play notes, as weU 
as a search fea- 
ture which allows 
you to search for 
phrases within 
your digitalized 
notes. An on- 
line commu- 
nity is acces- 
sible through 
the LiveScribe 
website for 
posting and 
sharing con- 
tent, as well 
as 250MB of 
online Storage 
for reviewing 
items from 
your note- 
book firom any 
computer. 



Another in- 
teresting fea- 
ture on this 
pen would be 
the recording 
of lectures and 
pen strokes with 
the 70 frames 
per second high 
speed infrared 
camera. The only 
obstacle may be 
that some profes- 
sors prefer not to 
have their lectures 
recorded for vari- 
ous reasons. 

The pen may be a 
cosdy tool as an aide 
to education, but ii 
can be compared lo 
the cost of a class text- 
book. Special dot pa- 
per notebooks are also 
required and sold in 
packs of four at SI 9.99. 
which is a bit cosdy; Li- 
veScribe is creatinga way 
to have printable dot pa- 
per, which should damp- 
en the cost of expensive 
notebooks in the future. 
If anyone has trouble 
with any of their classes, 
I would recommend this 
pen lo help them. This 
is a great product and I 
applaud the creators at 
LiveScribe for such an in- 
novative technology.

many songs from the op- 
era, the orchestra pausing 
between tunes to change 
[he mood. 

Most impressive, howev- 
er, was the Blue Danube 
waltz. Munoz noted thai 
the Port Wayne Philhar- 
monic played this piece 
as well as the Vienna Phil- 
harmonic on New Years 
Live; he was noi wrong. 
The soft opening of the 
piece blossomed Into a 
graceful waltz - only to be 
inicrrupted by the lights 
m the room dimming. 
As the music flowed, the 
lights alternated between 
dim and bright, then went 
oui altogether. Plunged 
in pilch blackness, the 
ciichestra continued the 
walu beautifully. Only the 
brass players in the back 
bad stand lights. 

Light was restored to tlie 
ruom after some frantic 
work, and the orchestra 
linished the piece ivilhout 
missing a beat. Munoz 
led the bow for this piece 
to an extended round of 
applause from the audi- 

The concert closed with 



an encore of the "Stars and 
Stripes Forever" by Sou- 
sa. With nice precision, 
the orchestra marched 
through the notes, giving 
it a striking air. Most in- 
teresting was the part the 
harp played, genUy rip- 
pling through the notes 
with an almost martial at- 
tention. 
It was an evening of great 



performances. Neither 
rain, nor moving, nor 
blackened lights could 
stop the orchestra or their 
guest conductor, who 
pulled together through 
the evening to give a fine 
performance.

Very young team meets struggles of Division I transition, rebuilding of a program 



By Dan Vance 

SpoiU Edilor 

They have now been lilerally 
seconds away from getting over 
ihe hill that losing has stood in 
[heir way. For the very young IPFW 
women's soccer learn though, 
even being that close isconsidercd 
an obstacle eliminated. 

• Pour of last year's lop six 
orfensive players: gone. 

• Holders of seven of the 10 goals 
in 2007: gone. 

• One goal in first seven games 
of 2008. Opponents have scored 
18. 

T^ck on 14 freshmen and only 
three upperdassmen and second 
year head coach Magaret Saurin 
has had her work cut out for her 
from the word go. 

But here they come, back from 
dominated losses to start the 
season and they are starting to 
compete with strong teams from 
mid-major conferences like the 
MAC and Horizon League. This 
past weekend, the team dropped 
games to Central Michigan and 
Valparaiso, teams that have 
a combined record of 10-2. 
However in the contests, IPFW 
only gave up two goals, showing a 
growing defensive effort. 

A pair of freshmen goalkeepers 
have helped lead that effon as 
they split minutes in goal. That 
likewise was highlighted this past 
weekend as Krislen McFadden 
picked up 13 saves and came 
17 seconds away from keeping 
Valparaiso scoreless. 

Junior Tammi Kerr has 
played little, but led strong by 
example to a strong core of 
freshmen defenders. Ontario, 
Canada natives Jessica Scheffee 
and fustine Le8lanc have started 
all seven games while fellow

seconds left. 



Ontario-native freshman Lauren 
McCracken have started five times 
but played in all seven games. 
The consistency and chemistry 
on defense is slowly making the 
Mastodons a contender while the 
offensive side of things comes 
together. 

Freshman Brittni Roy has 
been going after it strong on the 
offensive end. She currently has 
the team's only goal and has taken 
just over 25 percent of the team's 
shots with 12. Not 10 mention, 
senior Danielle OMandella has yet 
to break out, taking just one shot 
in the five games she has played 
in. 

A^er scoring one goal in each of 
her first two seasons, Oriandella 
led the team last season with 



three goals, tying for a team high. 
As a team, the Mastodons scored 
10 times in 2007. 

The season is set out as a crucial 
foundation for a long-term 
program rebuilding that started 
taking place after Saurin took 
over for longtime coach Terry 
Stefankiewicz last season. 

Whiie picked to finish eighth of 
nine teams in the Summit League 
this year, the Mastodons may have 
betterchances when Summit play 
starts September 26. 

Currendy, only tivo-time 
defending league champion 
Oakland has a vvinning record. 
IPFW's final home game is against 
Oakland on October 12.

Strength shown 
in final Invite 



In All Directions 

By Dan Vance 

sports Editor 



The women's volleyball team ended their weekend 
withaivin.ltwas a win thai puisthemat2-7. struggling 
on ihe surface as they end Invitational season. 

But ifone were to look past that surface record, they 
would see that this is a icam on the rise that showed 
flashesofbrillianccall weekend, even in defeat. 

On Friday night, they opened their final Invitational 
with a 3-0 (22-25. 
21-25, 17-25) loss I 
to Arkansas-Little 
Rock. Bui the loss 
isovershadowedin | 
someways, at liMsi 
in my mind, inti 
the excellent pl.iy 
of senior lessica 
Dominiak. The 



setter put up 26 
assists, a relatively 
low number but 
also scored seven 
kills and eight digs, 
putting her very 
close to a highly 
rare volleyball 
triple-double. Had

have been one the from a rare triple-double. 
highest moments 

in the team's Division I history. But even by coming 
close, she has opened some more eyes to just what 
IPFW can accomplish. 

Dominiak, like all of her teammates, was recruited to 
this team because they are very good players capable 
of competing on a very high level. It's a level that IPFW 
has been at for years thanks to many players and most 
importantly their coach. Kelly Hartley-Hutton. 

Hartley-Hutton has done amazing things for this 
program as a coach, mentor and recruiter. The things 
that she has accomplished along with the veteran 
players on this team may be too easily overlooked 
when a record of 2-7 is the first thing about the 
program that is seen. 

But they are far above that mark, even if this 
beginning was rough. 

This is a team that is on the rise, as shovm this past 
weekend by outstanding individual performances, 
including Dominiak's. 

Taryn Parker had a great match against Alcorn State 
with eight kills and four blocks. The outstanding 
effort capped off a 16 kill, eight block effort for Ihe 
weekend for her. Meanwhile, senior Christine Simon 
was so solid on defense with 22 digs and Ashley Dillon 
knocked down 26 balls for the weekend. 

Against Alcorn State, the team also totalled 12 
services aces, with three each coming from Parker and 
Simon. It was the third highest total in leam history. 
The match also saw a record broken in holding 
Alcorn Slate kj a liiiting percentage of -.200, which 

^^^ is Ihe lowest for an 

IPFW opponent since 
rally scorning was 
iniroducedin200]. 

Bottom line is : this 
team is now showing 
what they can do when 
there is not pressure 
on them. And all that 
will do is lead them to be more comfortable when the 
pressure is on. Invitational titles are nice, the team's 
trophy case is adorned \vith them from over the years. 
But, in the grand scheme, they are not as important 
as a Summit League croivn, which they are still very 
much expected to compete for. 

This weekend, the giris are in town on Saturday and 
Sunday for the first time this year and I only expect 
them to turn it up another notch on their way to 
another run through these final 20 matches.

Toulette keeps scoring as team keeps struggling 



I-reshman Max Toulette scored his 
third goal in less than a week, but it was 
IPFW's only one over two matches as 
they fell to Wright State and Southern 
Illinois-Ed wardsville during the past 
week. 

Wright State struck first last 
Wednesday in Dayton as they topped 
the Mastodons 2-1 in double overtime. 
BradenFleakscorcd first for the Raiders 
in the 13th minute of the contest. 
Toulette answered back in the 29th 
minule, converting on a one-on-one 



battle with Wright State goalie Aaron 
Hitler. The teams then battled back and 
forth, scoreless, for 73 minutes before 
Roger Downing ended the contest from 
three yards out, beating IPFW senior 
goalkeeper Michael Kniner. 

It was the 24th shot and ninth on 
goal for the Raiders, who dominated 
the Mastodons in shot totals. IPFW 
notched just 11 lotaJ shots but five of 
them were on goal, including tipvo from 
Cole Heimlich. It was Wright State's 
first win of the year. 




COLLINS 



Communicator co\un\r\\st heads to 
Italy to begin pro volleyball career 

loshua Collins, who has been penrung fitness columns for The Communicator 
this semester will now set his sights on regaining volleyball glory. The former 
Mastodon hitter has joined a squad in Italy and will begin his 
professional volleyball career there. 

Collins played all four years of college volleyball at IPFW. 
finishing up in 2007 after being part of back-lo-back Final Four 
teams for the school. The Bancroft, Ontario, Canada native hit 
.178 during four years as a Mastodon while starting 62 of the 110 
matches he played in. 

Consistently one of the top offensive performers each year, he 
totalled 496 kills with 39 service aces from 2004-2007. Collins also 
played solid on defense with 342 career digs and 135 total blocks. 

While he holds no individual school records, Collins was part of the 2006 team 
that won a record setting 16 straight matches. He also served up two aces in a 
February 3, 2007 match with Lewis, helping break the school record for service 
aces by a team with 15. 

Martinez sisters place back-to-back 

Cri'stina and Crystal Martinez continued their dominant ways for IPFW, 
leading llie team to a fourth place finish at the Mel Brodt Invitational in 
Bowling Green, Ohio over the weekend. Eight teams competed in the event, ivith 
IPFW lopping Ohio Stale, Marshall, Cleveland State and Niagara. Cincinnati took 
the top spot with Kent State and the host Falcons rounding out the top three, 
Crystina placed second in the event ivilh a time of 18:06, just 27 seconds behind 
first place Lilian Jeiimo of the winning Bearcats. Cr^'stal finished in third at a time 
of 18:21. IPFW is now ranked by the NCAA in 14th in the Great Lakes Region, just 
ahead of Central Michigan and behind Butler. 

Recht dominant in debut 

The second season of IPFW sophomore Amy Recht opened as well as the first 
closed. The reigning Summit League Player of the Year for women's tennis. One 
day one of the Detroit Titans Invitational, Recht defeated Charlotte Gibbons 
of Cleveland State 7-6(3) and 6-3. Recht was the only singles players who was 
victorious on day one. 

Concluding the event on Sunday, Recht defended her singles title at the event 
with a 5-7, 6- 1, 1 1 -9 victory over Detroit's Annie Moore. 

"1 thought our team played very well for our first competition of the year. 
Everyone fought hard and gave the maximum effort-especially after a tough first 
day." coach Eric Bums said in a release about the event. 

"We have to do a better job of closing out when we have leads, but that will come 
with more match experience. It was good to see all the newcomers play for the 
first dme and have success and I'm proud of Amy for defending her title. I think 
our team really started to come together this weekend. This is a result we can 
really build off of going forward." 

Ex-Mastodon keeper to play for U.S. 

Fort Wayne native and former IPFW goalkeeper Jeff Richey has joined the United 
Stales team for die 2008 FIFA Futsal World Cup. The tournament features teams 
from 20 countries for the first time and will be played in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 

Futsal is a version of soccer that includes just four field players and a goalie on 
each team, a smaller ball and smaller goals. Each half lasts just 20 minutes and is 
the only sanctioned form of international indoor soccer sanctioned by FIFA. 

At the beginning of the month, the U.S. dropped four games against teams from 
Brazil, the sport's country of origin. They also recently played four tune-up games 
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin against Japan and also a New England-based amateur 
squad. Richey's team mU be pan of Group B with Italy. Paraguay, Portugal and 
Thailand when play begins on September 30 in Rio. The tournament vdll wrap up 
on October 30. 

Communicator NCAA Football Rankings 

use now lops The Communicator poll after a decisive victory against Ohio State 
this past weekend. The Trojans also hold steady in ihe AP and USA Today Polls 
at the top. In the AP Poll, USC received all 61 first place votes. Georgia will drop 
down to number two despite a win that will keep them undefeated. Oklahoma 
is third again this week. Missouri moves up to number four and Florida enters 
for the first time in the fifth spot. Ohio State is the latest team to fall from The 
Communicator's rankings after their devestating loss to USC. 



IPFW tried to match that with their 
first on Sunday, but fell short. The 
Mastodons dropped a meeting with 
SIUE in the opener of a men/women 
double header at Hefner Soccer Field. 
2-0. 

The Cougars, a former Division II 
Great Lakes Valley Conference rival 
of the Mastodons, were hot on the 
offensive end. taking 21 shots and 
seven on goal. While Knitter was able 
to make four stops (another save came 
credited lo the team), it was two closely 



timed goals for SIUE that seated the 
Mastodons' fate. Brian Groark and 
Chris Anzalone scored within four 
minutes of eachother very early in the 
second half for the Cougars, Groark and 
Jack TWellman each took four shots in 
the win. 

Helmrich. Casey Bowman and Todd 
Mizicko each took shots on goal for 
IPFW. 

Toulette, Ihe teams leading goal

A main forgotten 
detail includes fair- 
ness. An optional sys- 
tem isn't going to mea- 
sure very high on the 
equality scale. How can 
one class offer the op- 
tion of a plus or minus, 
whereas others just 
stick with the straight 
letter grade? 

Student Body 
President Kody Tin- 
nel agreed with the 
relevant consistency 
issues. 

"One thing 



I have found to be com- 
mon among stu- 
dents is the belief 
that the new si's- 
tem needs a more 
consistent applica- 
tion than it currently 
has," Tinnel said. 

At the time of 
publication, Student 
Government did not 
have an official opin- 
ion on the matter, 
but Tmnel said, "The 
official opinions of 
student government 
are non-binding 
when it comes to 
the policies of the 
University, however it 
is important to recognize 
that many staff and fac- 
ulty members appreciate 
and respect the voice of 
the students, on issues 
that affect us directly. If 
enough support or op- 
position is shown for a 
particular topic then stu- 
dents truly can impact 
what happens, even if it 
is an uphill battle. " 

Grade disputes will 
likely become more com- 
mon with no consistent 
application. How will 
the grade appeals com- 
mittee respond to being 
inundated with student 
complaints after the fall 
semester passes? 



However, as of &gt;'et. As- the grading s&gt;'stem has
