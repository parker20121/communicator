Reagan wins 
mock election 



By DEBBIE CANTWELL 
It was a clen sweep for Ronald 
Reagan and the Republican ticket in 
last week's IPFW mock election. 
A total of 718 students 
—approximately seven percent of 
the student body— voted in the 
basement of Kettler Hall last 
Wednesday and Thursday. 

Reagan captured the presidential 
race with 257 votes, a 36.6 percent 
share of the total, while Independent 
candidate John Anderson followed 
with 208 votes, a 29.7 percent share, 
and President Jimmy Carter with 
177 votes, a 25.2 percent share. 

Libertarian candidate Edward 
Clark was fourth with 42 votes, 
followed by Citizens candidate 
Barry Commoner, 11 votes; Com- 
munist U.S.A. candidate Gus Hall, 3 
votes; Socialist candidate Clifton 
DeBerry, 2 votes; and American 
candidate Percy L. Greaves, Jr., 1 
vote. 

In the race for governor, 
Republican candidate Bob Orr won 
with 432 votes, a 64.3 percent share 
of the total ballots cast. John' 
Hillenbrand II, the Democratic 
candidate, received 225 votes, a 33.5 
percent share, and Cletus R. Artist, 
the American candidate, had 14 
votes, a 2.1 percent share. 

Republican candidate Dan Quayle 
defeated Democratic incumbant 
Sen. Birch Byah for the U.S. Senate 
race. Qyayle received 450 votes, a 64 
percent share, while Bayd tallied 253 
votes, a 35.9 percent share. 

For Fourth District congressman, 
Republican candidate Dan Coats 
was first with 417 votes, a 60.9 
percent share, followed by 



Democratic candidate John Walda 
with 243 votes, a 35.5 percent share, 
and Independant candidate Stephen 
G. Hope with 24 votes, a 3.5 percent 
share. 

Local party officials responded to 
the IPFW mock election. 

"Obviously I'm pleased," 
Republican city chairman Alan 
McMahan said. "People voting in 
the IPFW election are probably 
more questioning than the average 
voter." McMahan also said the 
victory relfects on the quality of the 
Republican candidates and their 
campaigns. 

Jim Kelley, chairman of the 
Democratic party in Allen County, 
said college students generally come 
from families with money, and those 
with money usually vote 
Republican. 

"I wouldn't expect students to vote 
any other way," said Kelley. 

The election was conducted by The 
Communicator with the cooperation 
of student organizations backing 
Democrats, Republicans and 
Anderson. 

Reagan was the presidential 
winner in a similar mock election 
conducted by The Observer, the 
student newspaper of the University 
of Notre Dame and adjoining St. 
Mary's College. In that election, 
Reagan received 489 votes, while 
Anderson was second with 371 votes 
and President Carter a distant third 
with 168 votes. Clark was fourth with 
46 votes and Hall fifth with 14 votes. 

Quayle and Orr also won their 
respective races in the Notre Dame 
election. 




Clown suit suits teacher 



Mertz works magic as Paco 



By STEPHANY 
HOLMES 

Suspended between fear and delight, 
the child watched the clown approach. 

He spoke to her, one child to another. 
She smiled hesitantly. Fingers flying, 
he twisted orange balloons into a 
giraffe and put it in her hands. She 
thanked him. She would talk about him 
all the way home. 

Paco had worked his magic once 
more. 

The man behind the magic? He's 
Scott Mertz, a 21-year-old recreation 
junior who teaches the history and art 
of clowning for the D?FW continuing 
education department. 

Six years ago he was working for the 
Atz ice cream chain. His employers 
chose him to be their birthday-party 
clown because of his friendly, outgoing 
personality. Two years later, he 
created his clown identity, Paco, and 
has since been busy working, 
developing new characters and now, 
teaching. 

Those who thought his class would be 
all baggy pants and grease paint have 
had an interesting surprise — they 
learn the history of clowns, jesters and 
fools in his course. 

"Of the 130 cultures in the world, 40 
have a prominent place in their society 
for clowns, jesters and fools," he said. 
"In China, a clown was important 
because he was the only one who spoke 
in theater productions. He narrated and 
gave meaning to plays in a culture 
where theater was very important." 

Hopi Indian clowns, covered with 
mud, would provide respite for par- 
ticipants in days-long dances, he said, 
by tumbling into the arena headfirst, 
drawing the audience's attention while 
dancers slipped away to rest. The 
clowns were accorded high priority and 
could enter the arena any time they 
chose. 

One of his favorite examples comes 
from the Catholic religion and the once- 
celebrated "Feast of Fools." 

"The presiding priest wore a 
donkey's head mask while performing 
the mass. Then the congregational 
response to the mass each time would 
be a donkey's hee-haw. Quite literally, 
a priest could say 'let us bray.' The 
priests grew to feel that this was 
beneath their dignity and tried to stop 
It. But the common people loved this 
ritual, and each year, kidnaped all the 
priests and held them until one of them 
agreed to be 'Priest of Fools.' The 
festivities then began by parading the 
priest around town and dousing him 
with seven buckets of water." 

Mertz enjoys teaching the clowning 
class, but finds performing as Paco 
very satisfying as well. 

He has performed at the Embassy 
Theater, Scottish Rite Auditorium, 
pienbrook, Peru Circus, auto shows 
and many area parades and at the 



"Paco will always be for\ the rights and well- 
being of children. Paco will always be for 
kids." Scott Mertz 



recent Johnny Appleseed Festival as 
Johnny Appleseed. 

His next appearance is at the 
Haunted Forest in FrankePark, Oct. 25 
and 26. Mertz is head of make-up for the 
Haunted Forest. 

His make-up expertise will be 
featured in the News Sentinel's 
Saturday magazine, Roto, on Oct. 25, 
spotlighting make-up as an alternative 
to masks for Halloween. 
His ability and versatility with make-up 
is apparent when considering the list of 
roles he portrayed; elf, vampire, witch, 
werewolf, troll, Easter Bunny, Santa 
Claus, Frankenstein and Charlie the 
chimpanzee. 

Mertz also takes on many roles in his 
private life. He is a multifaceted person 
with many interests, beliefs and con- 
cerns. His belief in loving and serving 
others is evident in many of the ac- 
tivities he chooses to become involved 
in. 

He is active in his church, St. Joe 
United Methodist, and is a tenor in the 
choir. He is a Red Cross Gallon Club 
donor. In the winter, he is an ice guard 
at park skating rinks, and in the 
summer, he is a recreation leader with 
the park system. He teaches children's 
classes at the YWCA and works with a 
4-H clowning club. He coached the club 
to second place in the Three Rivers 
Festival clowining competition this 
year. 

Another aspect of his 4-H work in- 
volves his firm support of equality for 
the sexes. Mertz, a member of the 
National Organization for Women, is 
responsible for a non-sexist revision of 
4-H literature by the 4-H National Rules 
Committee. Asked to become involved 
In a personality development course, he 
found the material to be blatantly 
stereotypical and asked Allen County 4- 
H Extension Leader, Cathy Seymour, if 
changes could be made. The National 
Rules Committee is revising it now. 

He feels the need to eliminate sexual 
stereotyping whenever he can because 
of his own experiences. 

"In high school, other guys are really 
threatened by someone who wants to be 
a clown. Maybe it's the make-up — I 
don't know," he said. "I have had to 
take a lot of abuse and name-calling for 
being a clown instead of a macho jock. I 
have been called a "sissy" and a "fag" 
for choosing a profession that I find 
highly rewarding and brings happiness 
toothers." 

"On the other side of the coin, I was 
once denied a job at Glenbrook as the 
Easter Bunny because I was 'male and 
wouldn't be good with children.' 
Children are my work. I wouldn't be 



doing this if I wasn't good with 
children." 

Mertz feels sexual stereotyping 
denies many vital choices for women 
and separates men from their feelings. 

"Males grow up emotionally 
paralyzed. We need reality therapy to 
bring us back to the real world. From 
the time you are born until the time you 
die, you are a male or female first — 
never just a person. Fifty percent of all 
your possibilities' are eliminated when 
the pink or blue blanket goes on. You 
are given these roles immediately 
without the time or permission to in- 
vestigate all that life may have to offer. 
For good of all of us, this somehow must 
end." 

Kay Roberts, sociology senior and 
also a member of NOW, has been the 
"significant other" in Mertz's life for 
the past year. She was asked how his 
awareness of women's issues affects 
their relationship. "It makes it 
possible," was her reply. 

"Scott is a sensitive, warm, strongly 
person-oriented person who truly 
cares about others," she said. "He 



questions and seeks knowledge 
everywhere, and I know his level of 
awareness and caring will continue to 
grow. He would be an asset to any cause 
he chose to support, including the 
women's movement." 

Caring about others is a part of 
Mertz's future, too. He has specific 
hopes for the character of Paco. "I 
don't ever want to see him associated 
with a product or synidacted like a 
Ronald McDonald or Bozo, but I can see 
him promoting a safety campaign or 
something like that. Paco will always 
be for the rights and well-being of 
children. Paco will always be for kids." 

For himself, Mertz would like to 
teach on the college level or work in 
recreation with the public parks system 
and its special activities. He also finds 
the special effects and make-up of film- 
making an enticing possibility. 

Whatever he chooses, children will 
always be an important part of Scott's 
life. He and Roberts have discussed 
having a home where children of all 
ages, races and handicaps, will be 
welcome to live. 

"I want those children nobody else 
seems to want — even the troubled 
ones," he said. "I have enough love for 
them all." 

Cole Porter once said, "all the world 
loves a clown." Scott Mertz is a clown 
that loves it right back. 




Experts hunt ways 
to end youth crime 

"In 1979, we paid back $33,000— and that 
comes completely out of the offenders' pockets, 
not the taxpayers'." Judge Louis Bloom 



Editor's Note: In this third and final 
, article In Robert Rlnearson's scries on 
youth crime, the focus is on the 
viewpoint of the authorities and 
criminal psychologists who work with 
youthful offenders. 
(c.) 1980 Robert Rinearson 

As numerous reports and statistics 
show steady rises in Juvenile crime, the 
public Is left wondering how the 
criminal justice system will treat 
youthful offenders in the coming years 
compared to the past. 

"Perhaps 10 years ago we felt 
psychology was an answer," said Stan 
Veit, director of the Fort Wayne 
Juvenile Facility, "But now more than 
ever, we appreciate the difficulty of 
such a limited viewpoint. Simply, some 
kids we can reach with psychological 
methods and others we cannot." 

Another opinion was expressed by 
Cathryn Adamsky, associate professor 
of psychology at IPFW. "Instead of 
looking toward psychology as the an- 
swer, we should incorporate It merely 
as a means of finding a solution," she 
said. 

George Albee, professor of 
psychology at the University of Ver- 
mont, felt that psychology is doing little 
about the prevention of crime In our 
society. He says, "Psychology has 
joined the regressive movement toward 
self-interest and status." Society Is 
more interested in protecting Itself than 
in social revolution, added Albee. 

If the general public had the Illusion 
that a juvenile delinquent was nothing 
more than a misguided child In need of 
protection, it may be in for a real 
revelation with today's young criminal. 

Gary Gordon, a member of the staff 
at the Indiana Boys' School, talked 
about the differences in personalities 
compared to only a few years ago. "The 
kids we get now are more blatant about 
their crime," he said. "It becomes a 
real show of toughness. In fact, the kids 
seem to feel it's a status symbol when 
they appear hard." 

One Fort Wayne policeman thought 
that handling a street-wise kid who 
makes a living from crime is like ex- 
periencing what hell is like. 



been focused on the victims of juvenile 
crime. 

One citizen put it this way, "You'd 
think the way the authorities treated 
those kids that they were the victims 
and not the criminals." 

One alternative to looking the youth 
away in a correctional center is for him 
or her to work off the damages incurred 
to their victims through restitution. 

"Restitution has been, and 
foreseeably always will be, a part of our 
program here in Allen County," said 
Judge Bloom. 

"In 1979, we payed back $33,000 — 
and that comes completely out of the 
offenders' pockets, not the taxpayers'," 

Bloom said the youths found guilty 
are given 50 to 90 days in which to pay 
back the restitution. 

"All this frenzy in opinion against the 
juvenile delinquent, I feel, Is ignited by 
some literature filled with revenge 
trying to stir up public emotion," 
declared Bloom. 

What then, will become of youth 
crime Itself? Will we see an increase in 
the '80s? 

Velt feels this Is a hard question to 
answer. "I would imagine if there was 
an Innuendo to what might happen in 
the future, it would be the increase in 
young girls coming into the criminal 
justice system. And it's not just for 
crime of petty theft or prostitution, but 
all types of crime — burglary, assault 
and armed robbery Included." 

"At a recent seminar, I saw statistics 
showing a 300 to 400 percent Increase in 
crimes involving girls," Veit said. 

ff you were to ask people on the street 
why they thought youth crime was 
increasing, most would be able to 
deliver their own opinions. But it seems 
the most common attitude places the 
blame on society. 

"We've had a complete breakdown in 
our moral fiber here in America ,'■' 
Bloom said. "So instead of dealing with 
pranks as we once did in court, we now 
deal with juvenile offenses and an 
entirely new breed of criminal," 

"Parents never seem to know where 
the hell their kids are," said one police 
officer. "Every time I'm on patrol late 



"At a recent seminar, I sow statistics showing 
a 300 to 400 percent Increase in crimes involving 
girls," Stan Veit. 



"It's not unusual for a kid to kick at 
you and call your mother every name 
in the book," said the policeman. 
"You never want to turn your back on 
them; they might try to lift your gun 
and turn on you." 

"We get a lot of bold and brash kids 
before the bench every day," echoes 
Allen County Juvenile Judge Louis 
Bloom. "You Just learn to sift the b.s. 
from the fact." 

Through the years, Bloom has sat In 
judgment of many youths who have 
appeared in court before him. For 
some, he feels, it is easy to predict what 
kind of crimes they'll do later on in life. 

"I've no doubt some will become 
murderers," Bloom projected. "But, 
through the law, we must restrict 
ourselves to the crimes he or she 
commits now. Just because the kid is 
rotten, we cannot totally remove him 
from society. Remember, that's the 
price of freedom." 

In recent years, a lot of attention has 



at night, there's kids on every street 
corner. And not only 17 and 18-year- 
olds, but kids under 14 as well." 

"Plus, it's not limited to the city, but 
it's going on in the rural areas as well," 
the police officer added. "Every 
weekend another boy or girl has an all- 
night party — complete with booze and 
drugs. It's all because some all-too- 
trusting parents have left them the 
house while they are out of town." 

"If we're ever going to put a halt to 
the increase," asserts Veit, "preven- 
tion must first start at home. Every 
child needs unconditional love, 
security, and most importantly, 
structure in their home. An attitude on 
behalf of the parent that you don't 
necessarily have to be a nice guy is also 
needed." 

Psychologist Adamsky also em- 
phasized the importance the role model 
at home plays. "You must un- 
derstand," she said. "The child's 
behavior stays the same only If the 
people around him stay '.he same." 



Faculty Senates accept 
committee's constitution

" ... and one government, overall ..." 
This is the one dream that has been on 
the minds of the Indiana and Purdue 
Faculty Senate members of Fort 
Wayne for some time. 

"The marriage between the Indiana 
and Purdue faculty looks more like a 
reality," said Michael Downs, chair- 
person and associate professor of 
political science. 

The topic of unity between Indiana's 
and Purdue's faculty in Fort Wayne has 
been long in discussion. Barbara 
Bulmahn, assistant professor of 
mathematics, said "About five or six 
years ago, there was a subgroup within 
the larger that tried to develop the idea 
into reality, but other conflicts arose. It 
wasn't the right time. We've come a 
long way." 

October 16 marks a date of im- 
portance as the dream comes closer to 
becoming a reality. The ad hoc Com- 
mittee of Faculty Governance 
presented the constitution for ac- 
ceptance. The constitution was ac- 
cepted by unanimous vote in both 
Senates after a couple of minor 
revisions were made. 

The document is a formal guideline to 
follow. It defines who can vote 
(faculty), certification, roles of of- 
ficers, convocations, assemblies and 
powers, ft outlines the qualifications of 
the Senate and provides rules to be 
abided. 



Although both faculty senates of 
IPFW approved the constitution, other 
steps still must betaken. 

First, the voting faculty members of 
IPFW must -ratify the constitution by 2- 
3 vote on both sides. Voting faculty is 
determined by the old constitution. 

Then, the Indiana Board of Trustees 
(Bloomington), and the Purdue Board 
of Trustees (Lafayette), must 
acknowledge and approve the Con- 
stitution for existence. 

The construction of the new con- 
stitution to unify the IPFW faculty was 
a team effort. Bulmahn was pleased 
with her committee. "I've never 
worked with a committee that focused 
so well," she said. The committee is 
comprised of members from both 
faculties. 

Bulmahn further commented, "We 
knew what we wanted to accomplish. 
We have shown that we can all work 
well together." Members of the ad hoc 
Committee of Faculty Governance are 
Barbara Bulmahn, chairperson, 
Michael Downs, Jo Keller, David 
Onwood and Richard Wall, all faculty 
members at IPFW. 

If the Indiana and Purdue faculty 
members ratify the new constitution 
and the Indiana and Purdue boards of 
trustees acknowledge the forma! 
document, chances are, the 
engagement will end and the long 
awaited marriage between both 
governments will become a reality.

Procrastinators: keep up good work 



Constitutions approved 



Two important constilulions affecting 
students and faculty at IPFW were 
examined and eventually approved by 
two different governing bodies on 
campus last week. 

The combined faculty senates of 
Indiana and Purdue universities ap- 
proved a new faculty constitution which 
would establish a single governing 
system for those groups last Thursday. 
This document will be a cornerstone for 
uniting university functions at IPFW if it 
is ratified by faculty members this week 
and later approved by I,U. and Purdue 
trustees. 

In the past, separate administrations 
and faculties co-existed on (his campus, 
but the overlap was eliminated when the 
administration and business functions, 
as well as the academic areas, were 
combined. Nevertheless, the two 
faculties remained separate, and each 
senate operated in isolation of the other 

Now, however, should this important 
document be ratified, Indiana and 
Purdue will be taking a giant stride 
toward the blended ideal envisioned for 
this regional campus. The senate, which 
is responsible for duties that equally 
affect students of both I.U. and Purdue 
— like determining the academic 
calendar and recommending policies 
concerning student conduct and 



discipline, faculty tenure and promotion 
and admission of students — should 
naturally function as a blended unit. 

Another significant constitution 
examined — for the second lime this 
semester — last week and ultimately 
ratified, was the Student Body Con- 
stitution. Although steamed in con- 
troversy, the passage of this document 
was importanl because the document 
affects the IPFW student body in the 
manner by which it is governed. Even 
the student senators who were con- 
cerned about the image the students' 
might have of the Senate — due to the 
time taken to approve the constitution 
and the healed arguments over it — 
finally agreed it was a necessary, 
although laborious, task. 

Unfortunately, however, we outside 
the realm of these governing bodies 
become more impatient and bored 
reading about constitutions "as yet" 
unapproved than the members of the 
groups. Sometimes, unaware of their 
Iremenduus undertakings, we assign 
these groups the undeserved reputation 
of "not doing anything." 

The combined faculty senates of I.U, 
and Purdue and the Students' Senate are 
by no means deserving of that 
reputation. 



Last election thoughts 



It has become increasingly apparent 
that American voters have viewed the 
past several presidential elections as 
choices between lesser evils, rather than 
undertaking them with a positive at- 
titude. 

In 1964, we saw the beginning of the 
trend. With Lyndon Johnson and the then 
frighteningly conservative Barry 
Goldwaler leading the way, we em- 
barked on a series of presidential races 
that were decided by voters considering 
which candidate would do the least harm 
if elected. The only respite was the 
Democratic primary in 1968, where 
voters look an active and positive part in 
the choice being made, only to have that 
choice invalidated by an assassin. 

With that lone exception, there have 
been five straight presidential primaries 
and elections that have been clouded by 
this negative atmosphere. Is it any 
wonder that the involvement of youth in 
politics is at an all time low. 

The present presidential debacle is an 
excellent example of the choices 

Readers write 



American voters have been given in the 
past few presidential elections. 

Politicians are quick to pick up on the 
moods of the electorate and run their 
campaigns accordingly. Witness the 
name calling and mud-slinging 
characteristic of this year's contest. The 
emphasis has been that the opposition's 
candidate is dangerous or incompetent. 
Bui what is really frightening is that this 
year the mud-slinging seems to be 
filtering down to the other races. 

The trend toward "negative politics" 
is becoming not only more pervasive, 
but also more blatant. This year the 
name calling, etc., are not even being 
lightly disguised. 

How many more years will this 
situation be allowed to exist? From 
where will the candidate come who 
people can look to with the positive 
feelings with which they looked at a 
Roosevelt, an Eisenhower, a John 
Kennedy'' How much longer can the 
voters, and more importantly, how 
much longer can the country wait? 



Reader blasts 'sexist' females 



To The Editor, 

Concerning Nancy Slick's 
arlicle of October 9. 1980. I 
would like lo respond (or 
retaliate) This is one honest 
to goodness male who has 
had it with females such as 
Ms. Slick who find it difficult 
to " ..write about men's 
altitudes about women." but 
somehow proceed anyway. 

First, when Ms. Slick uses 
words like '"they" and 
"them" concerning males 
who justify rape, she in- 
cludes (intentionally or not) 



me. which 1 think is brassy, 
overbearing, pin-headed, 
irresponsible and otherwise 
very female of her. (I can 
hear her screamin* all the 
way over here over that last 
Hem, and indeed it was only 
included to raise her con- 
sciousness about 
generalizations, and does not 
reflect any actual opinion on 
my part) 

Second, when talking 
about those particular 
women who flaunt what they 
have (or haven't), she uses 
the adjective "some." 



However, when she goes on 
to admit that not all men 
, stoop lo lewd comments and 
the like, she rather grudginly " 
uses the adjective "some" 
again. The apparent im- 
plication here is that MOST 
women don't flaunt their 
flesh &lt;I agree) and that 
MOST men are lewd and 
crude anyway. After that 
ridiculous implication, she 
says "let's be friends." I say 
"fine," but only after she 
drops her sexist biases and 
opens her closed mind.

Senator corrects paragraph 



To the Editor: 

This is regarding the ar- 
ticle that appeared in The 
Communicator on Oct. B 
concerning the Student 
Senate meeting of Oct. 1 and 
entitled "Sparks fly at 
Senate meeting." 

Even though the genera) 
tone of the article was good, 
there were several 
misleading statements 
reported in the second 
paragraph 

First, the Constitution 
Committee ( Bob Griebel and 
myself) did not "set the 
spark" that caused the rest 
of the meeting to be so ex- 
plosive. The Constitution 



was not yet-ready for con- 
sideration Bob and I still 
had a few items to take care 
of before we felt we could 
present the final draft of the 
Constitution. Further con- 
frontation was spared by not 
considering the Constitution 
The second misleading 
statement of the paragraph 
was that Bob and I "pleaded 
for a one week extension." 
An extension was not asked 
for. There was nothing to 
extend. The document was 
not ready for consideration. 
What the committee asked of 
the Senate was patience. Bob 
and 1 asked for it, we did not 
plead. 



Jell Sandy did move to 
ratify parts of the Con- 
stitution, but only those parts 
the committee was ready to 
present. However, when the 
issue was put before the 
Senate for debate, it was not 
argued upon. It was 
debated— granted the debate 
was spirited and lively— but 
it was not argument. 

It is a shame that another 
fine article was clouded by 
these misleading 

statements. I hope I have 
clarified them somewhat,

Procrastinators of the 
world unite! Keep up that 
stalling. Send Christmas 
cards in February. Be late. 
Better yet, don't show up at 
all! 

There are more 

procrastinators in this world 
than we may think, bul few 
people know them because 
they hardly ever show up. At 
any rate, procrastination is 
around us — influencing our 
lives. 

Most people don't realize 
the advantages or 
procrastination. They get so 
immersed in what they are 
doing, they forget to put 
things off. Don't they realize 
thai the very country we live 
in was created under the 
influence of procrastination? 

(Not many people would 
recognize the name of 
Herbertio Campbell. Old 
Bert was the ship's 
navigator for Christopher 
Columbus, He was such a 
procrastinator that when 
Chris said, "Hey, Herbie, 
let's go find India," Bert said 
"Not today, Chris, 1 have to 
call my mother." Calling 
one's mother was quite an 
occasion then, since 
telephones were still non- 
existent, and Bert would 
disappear for months at a 
time. He procrastinated for 
so long that he finally died, 
and poor Chris set out on his 
own. Fortunately for us, 
Chris didn't know his way 
around ) 



Now, God wasn't a very 
good procrastinator. Before 
making light, God fumbled 
around in die dark for five 
days when exlra lime could 
have been used; with 
procrastination period of 100, 
even to years, things would 
be a lot different. 

Instead of being stuck in_ 
the midwest. Ft. Wayne 
might have been placed in a 
nicer spot, say the Bahamas, 
perhaps. (Of course, Gen. 
Anthony Wayne would have 
had a lot of explaining to do 
about the way he was in the 
Bahamas instead of in 
Indiana toppling Indian 
empires) 



fan 



of 



procrastination is the Bus 
Company; no bus is expected 
to be on schedule, and 
through dedication to 
tradition, none ever Is. 

Contrary to popular belief, 
late busses are not a hin- 
drance. In truth, nothing is 
more reassuring than a late 
bus; when you breathlessly 
run into a lunch date or a 
business meeting 10 or 15 
minutes late, it shows how 
much you thought about 
being there, And, of course, 
your companions will praise 
you for your dedication 
despite your failing health 
and sweat-stained clothes. 

Teachers are very fond of 
procrastination, although to 
my knowledge no one ever 
teaches a class on that trait. 
A teacher will generally 
arrive to class two and a half 



to three and a quarter 
minutes late, proceed to dig 
through unorganized papers 
for the day's lesson, and aks, 
"How are you all today?" 
(Although he neither expects 
nor desires an answer). The 
class is then delayed while 
the teacher runs back to his 
office in search of his lost 
papers. The class, of course, 
will eventually be let out 
late. (I personally know of 
one chemistry class that 
began in the spring of 1967 
and is still in progress — 
although no one has seen the 
teacher since 1975). 

And while teachers are 
great procrastinators, the 
prize for achievement below 
and before the call-of-duty 
must go to students when the 
subject is homework. Every 
student knows homework 
was made to be 
procrastinated about, and 
here are some of the simple 
steps taken (o deal with 
homework ; 

Don't write down the 
assignment. 

Hide your books under 
your bed. 

Accidentally break your 
pencil leads. 

Watch an old movie. 

Promise to do your 
homework tomorrow.

A student-mother defends her 
college education, mothering 



By JULIA L. 
PLATTER 

I may not be speaking just 
for myself, for I'm sure I'm 
not the only one trying to 
raise a child and tackle my 
college studies at the same 
time. 

What really disturbs meii 
some people don't seem to 
understand what we as 
young student-mothers are 
trying to accomplish. 

I was having my usual 
lunch and study period when 
two older ladies (at least 10 
years older than myself) 
were expressing their point 
of view about student- 
mothers, and myself being 
one, my ears perked up. 

After hearing what they 
had to say, I had to restrain 
myself from screaming. 

But to ease their minds, 
I'm quite sure my one-year- 
old will not grow up and be 
an irresponsible criminal by 
the time I'm out of school. 
(in two years, hopefully). 
I'm also quite sure he will 
know who his mother is. 

I must admit I miss my son 
quite a bit and 1 really enjoy 
the times we are together. 
Who knows, maybe being 
apart from each other like 
we are is good for the both of 

I really feel I can offer my 
child more in the long run 
when I finish collene. so I 



don't have any regrets. 

Maybe someday the two 
older ladies will understand. 
For now, think about. what 
you say. Somebody (like me) 

may be listening.

By TIMOTHY J. 
ROSS 

II all began with a phone 
call. 

II was my day off and 1 
was wishing for something lo 
do. The phone rang and I 
eagerly answered it. I was 
informed that I was lo meet 
wilh a gentleman in a few 
hours. 

Hoping for some ex- 
citement, I drove to the 
meeting place, an ugly green 
shack shrouded in clouds. I 
almost left when a creature 
waving a machete emerged 
from the dismal building and 
started towards me. 

I began to wonder when 
my nightmare would end 
when I noticed the sign thai 
read, "New Haven Jaycee 
and Jayteen House of 
Terror." 

I regained my grasp on 
reality and realized that I 
was at one of the many 
haunted houses that spring 
up near Halloween. Each 
October, these houses open 



all over the Fort Wayne 
area, offering benefits to the 
community and various 
charities. 

This year, the group hopes 
to make near $6300.00, most 
of which will go to the 
muscular dystrophy foun- 
dation. Part of the money 
will also be used for com- 
munity projects that the 
Jaycees hold each year. 

The little fire-scarred 
building with cardboard 
walls adds an exciting 
alternative to another 
problem — what to do on a 
boring evening. Young and 
old alike can enjoy being 
horrified by blood-thirsty 
vampires or a seven-fool- 
two-inch green monster. 

Darrel, who playB the part 
of Frankenstein, is 
responsible lor all the 
electrical wiring in the 
house. He volunteered to 
play the part at the in- 
sistence of Mike Pratt, a co- 
chairman of the project 
"Walking around on 10 in- 



ches of two-by-four is not 
easy, but it is my one chance 
a year to help a charity," he 
said. 

Although the house will be 
open three weeks (Oct. 10 to 
Oct. 31 1, volunteers have 
been working since August 
lo get the building ready. 
Many of Ihe rooms were 
decorated by members of 
the community. According 
lo Pratt, anyone age 16 and 
up could have planned a 
room. 

The House of Terror, now 
in its fifth season, is on 
Green Street in New Haven 
It is open from 7:00 to 11:00 
p.m. nightly. There is a 
donation fee of Jl. 50. 

The March of Dimes will 
be opening its fourth annual 
haunted house. The haunted 
house is at Jefferson and 
Ewing. It is scheduled to 
open on Oct. 17, at S:00p.m. 

The Haunted Forest will 
be at Franke Park also. 




Melodrama offers fun 



BySUESNODGRASS 
The Saint Francis 
production of "Dirly Works 
at the Crossroads" is a 
melodrama that first ap- 
pears corny, but later seems 
lo offer untimely humor and 
plain fun. 

As In any melodrama, 
"Crossroads" primes the 
audience beforehand to boo 
and hiss at the villains and to 
Cheer for the heroes, and 
relies on this audience 
participation throughout the 
remainder of the per- 
formance. 

The story is simple and 
sweet to the point that il is 
almost sticky It is a simple 
love story involving a hero 
and heroine and a villain and 
villainess. The lovers, Nellie 
Lovelace and Adam 
Oakharl, are childhood 
sweethearts whose wedding 
is Interrupted by the evil 
deeds and brewings of ihe 
daslurdly Munro Murg- 
atroyd. 

Teresa Paetz and Erik 
Henry' offer perhaps the besl 
performances in their 
portrayal of the lovers, 
Nellie and Adam. One can'l 
help but smile when Nellie 
enters the scene. 

Susan Horlne and Rick 



Gmbb compliment the story, 
as Horlne portrays the 
conniving yet deep Ida 
Rhine go Id and Grubb plays 
the lovable and rustic 
country bumpkin, Mookie 



Perhaps Ihe least im- 
pressive of all the per- 
formers was Stan Holloway, 
who depicted Ihe evil 
scoundrel Munro Murg- 
atroyd. Holloway por- 
trayed Murgatroyd as a 
villain, but as one of the most 
important characters, he 
failed lo convince the 
audience just how vile and 
pernicious he was. 

The performers' 

exaggerated gestures and 
archaic humor preface such 
familiar and memorable 
lines as, "O' woe! O' 
despair! Shall I ever sec my 
beloved Adam again." 

"Crossroads" teems wilh 
such slapstick comedy and, 
yes folks, it even includes a 
scene where Murgotroyd 
lies our hero, Adam 
Oakharl, lo the railroad 
tracks as Ihe 9:00 B&amp;B is 
heard roaring in the 
distance; the entire bedlam 
is reminiscent of an old 
Dudley Dorighl cartoon. 

Even though "Cross- 



roads" isn'l a musical, it is 
interspersed with an 
assembly ol voices in lune to 
Ihe "tinkling of ivories," 
adding humor and com- 
plimenting the already 
hilarious troupe. 

As Ihe villains, Ida 
Rhinegold and Murgatroyd, 
enter, the pianist breaks inlo 
a timely rendition imitating 
the theme once heard every 
Friday nighl at the 
beginning of Dragnet In one 
scene, where the broken- 
hearted Nellie is con- 
templating running off lo 
Chicago with Murgatroyd, 
jusl at the heighlh of the 
scene's intense emo- 
tionalism, the choir 
interrupis the suspense by 
crooning "Dark town 
Strutter's Ball." This kind of 
frivolous musical fun is 
heard throughout the play. 

Although "Crossroads" 
may seem sappy and trite, it 
offers indispensable humor 
and good clean fun. Once 
some of the commonplace 
mistakes of opening night 
Jillers are cured, 
"Crossroads" will leave the 
audience feeling as Nellie 
Lovelace did when she and 
Adam were reunited, "0' 
joy. 0' rapture. Now we can 
all live happily ever after." 



Woody experiments 



By MIKEGEFFEN 

"Stardust Memories" 
Is Woody Allen's most 
experimental, and, in 
many ways, most daring 
film lo date. Allen clearly 
sees himself at a 
crossroad in his career, 
and the confused nature 
of the film indicates he 
doesn'l know where to 
turn. 

"Memories" is a 
strident barb at his critics 
and a plea to his fans for 
tolerance, In it, Alien 
seems to be stating that 
he needs a little breathing 
space. 

He doesn't know 
whether he wants lo make 
comedies or dramatic 
films, and he needs some 
lime to sort things out 

In a Time magazine 
interview given when 
"Interiors" was released, 
Allen stated that he would 
like to allernate between 
serious films and 
comedies. He is angry at 
his critics and fans for not 
giving him a chance to 
grow "Memories" is 
Allen's way of working 
out this anger and in- 
decision. 

The battle .between the 
light and dark sides of 
Allen is distinctly set up 
in the film's first s 



this scene, filmmaker 
Sandy Bates (Allen) is 
sitting on a train. The 
mood is bleak, and the 
train is full of grim people 
with grotesque faces. 
This train can be seen as 
the somber side of Allen 
that was seen in 
"Interiors." 

Bates looks out the 
window and sees another 
train. This train is filled 
with happy people. A 
beautiful woman looks al 
him and smiles. This 
train can be seen as 
Allen's lighter side, the 
pari of him thai wants to 
make funny movies. This 
is the pari of him that 
made "Sleeper," "Love 
and Death" and "Annie 
Hall." The trains are 
going in different 
directions, and the film is 
pulled apart. 

The film does not 
totally succeed because 
Allen fails to provide a 
link between thetwo sides 
of "Memories." 

It is when Allen gets 
serious about the Bates' 
character that 

"Memories" begins to 
break down. When he 
deals with Bates' 
relationship with women, 
Bates' fear thai his work 
does not have lasting 



value, and his childhood, 
Allen does not know what 
he is trying to say. These 
scenes are chaotic, 
darkly lit, and the cause 
of the film's confused 
tone. 

He is confused, and 
can't figure out how to 
fuse together the serious 
and funny sides of him- 
self. He can make funny 
films that are serious, or 
dramas with a tinge of 
comedy, but he doesn't 
know how to balance the 
two. Allen does not have a 
connection between the 
two halves of 

"Memories" because he 
cannot reconcile the two 
sides of himself 

The film can be seen as 
an experiment in which 
Allen is trying to deal 
with his frustration. In a 
poignanl scene that points 
out his frustration, Allen 
is standing in an 
auditorium looking back 
at a movie screen. He 
seems to be asking, 
"What do you want?" 

Throughout "Stardust 
Memories," that is the 
question Allen seems to 
be asking his critic, his 
fans and himself. In the 
final analysis, maybe 
that's all he wanted to 



ask

'The Boss 9 is back 



By MICHELE 
DeVINNEY 

Just when it seems that 
Bruce Springsteen has 
reached near perfection, he 
releases a new album that 
exceeds even his usual 
standard of excellence. 

"The River," a hand- 
somely packaged two-record 
set, is easily as good as— if 
not better than— his 1976 
album "Darkness on the 
Edge of Town," and he of- 
fers 20 new songs, including 
the title cut performed in the 
"No Nukes" film. 

While his music is cer- 
tainly good, it's the lyrics 
that really distinguish these 
songs. The words are so well- 
chosen they almost read like 
poetry. 

The concepts on "The 
River" are familiar to those 
who've heard his earlier 
albums. Springsteen con- 
tinues to deal with universal 
human experiences rather 
than loftily complaining 
about life on the road or 
about the woes of being rich 



and famous. 

"Independence Day" 
chronicles the bittersweet 
relationship between him 
and his father. 

The clash is apparent in 
lines like "There was just no 
way this housecould hold the 
two of us," and "Nothing we 
can say is going to change 
anything now." 

What sets Springsteen 
apart from other rebels is his 
sensitivity to his father, and 
the attitudes are less biting 
than poignant. Despite the 
admitted differences, he 
displays genuine warmth 
when he says "They ain't 
gonna do to me what I 
watched them to do you" and 
concedes "I guess we were 
just too much of the same 
kind." 

The most prevalent sub- 
ject throughout the LP is 
marriage. 

But Springsteen deals with 
it on a wide variety of levels. 
On "I Wanna Marry You," 
his approach is realistic 
("They say in the end true 



love prevails, but in the end 
true love can't be no 
fairytale"), yet hopeful ("To 
say I'll make your dreams 
come true would be wrong, 
but maybe I could help them 
along") and romantic ("I 
wear my love without 
shame— I'd be proud if you 
would wear my name" ) . 

The title song contrasts 
that optimism with regret 
and cynicism. The couple 
portrayed in "The River" 
marry at 19 as the result of 
her pregnancy, and they're 
followed through a cold, 
practical wedding, shattered 
dreams and acquired in- 
difference. To parallel their 
story, even the river, once 
the site of their young and 
carefree love, has fried and 
eroded.

Probably his greatest 
improvement is his singing. 
On previous albums, the 
lyric sheets were a bare 
necessity to understand most 
of what was sung. Here it's 
merely a luxury since 
Springsteen has overcome 
his muddled slurring, and he 
prominently displays his 
well-structured epics. 

The E Street Band should 
not be ignored. In the studio 
and onstage, they're the best 
band in the country today. 
After more than five years 
together, they've developed 
a thight, cohesive sound. 

For those who've 
anxiously looked for 
Springsteen's latest album to 
surface, your day has 
come — and he's made it 
worth your wait.

The Tuskers also 
displayed some aggresive 
defense as they outshot their 
guests, 39-9. 

On Thursday, the Tuskers 
hosted Findlay College in the 
first meeting between the 
two schools. IPFW came 
from behind several limes to 
tie the score but could never 
gel the go-ahead goal. 

Findlay scored all of their 
four goals in breakaways. 

"We were disappointed," 
said IPFW coach Ed 
Stefankiewicz, "because we 
outplayed them in every 
aspect except the score." 
Indicative of this was the 
fact that IPFW outshot 
Findlay, 39-5. 

Johnson scored twice and 
Sharpe once for the Tuskers. 
The road trip to Marion 
proved successful for the 
Tuskers and Sharpe, in 
particular, as he scored all 
three of the team's goals. 

IPFW dominated the 
game, but the second half 



produced some very 
physical play from the 
frustrated Marion squad. 
Sweeper back Chris Wan- 
suffered an ankle injury in 
the final half. He will miss 
the next game. 

"What Marion lacked in 
speed, they tried to make up 
for with contact." 
Stefankiewicz said. "I think 
the officials let the game get 
out of hand." 

The Tuskers travel to the 
University of Michigan this 
Saturday. Stefankiewicz 
assessed the Wolverine club 
as fast. "They are a quick 
team," he said. "We will 
need good ball control 

On November 1, the soccer 
team will travel to Adrian 
College for a noon start. The 
Tuskers will close their 
season on November 4 
against a very powerful 
Inidana Tech squad. The 
game will start at 3:00 p.m. 
and will be played at the 
Tech field. 



They do more than cheer 



ByTlMOTHVJ.ROSS 
A cheerleader, according 
to Webster's Dictionary, is 
one who leads cheers. If this 
is true, then the girls leading 
cheers this year must be 
closer to saints than 
cheerleaders. 

IPFW is blessed with the 
gift of eight cheerleaders 
who believe there is more to 
cheerleading than leading 
cheers They are Tina 
Adams, freshman; DeeDee 
Berkley, freshman, Mari 



Beyler, freshman; JoEUa 
Dell, sophomore. Simone 
Koch, freshman; Sue 
Lauitsen, sophomore, Sue 
Light, freshman; and 
Tangee Shepherd, freshman, 

Of the eight, only one has 
cheered for IPFW berore. 
Sue Laurilscn Is the only 
returning cheerleader. The 
others from last year had too 
many other obligations. 

The girls believe that they 
have more to do than Just 




1980 IPFW cheerleaders Sue Laurilsen and Dee Dee 
Barkley practice a routine. 



" ... through us cheering, 
we will be able to express the 
athletic department more. A 
lot of people do not even 
know about the soccer team 
or that there are 
cheerleaders," Simone Koch 
said. "We will definitely help 
out by sponsoring events and 
letting people know what is 
going on.," 

The girls, along with their 
advisor-supervisor Terl 
Eberwine, decided to in- 
crease the number of 
cheerleaders this year. 
Instead of having tryouls for 
those who signed up, the 
girls planned to have two 
squads, but some of those 
signed up left, leaving one 
squad of eight. 

The girls are also trying to 
increase public attendance 
at the athletic events. They 
are posting signs to ad- 
vertise games and en- 
couraging their frelnds and 
families to attend the events 

"I tell all of my friends to 
stop on over," said Tina 
Adams. 

Although most of them 
haven't cheered since grade 
school, the girls practice 
every Monday and work 
very hard at performing well 
as a group. According to 
athletic director, David 
Skelton, "This is possibly the 
most enthusiastic group of 
cheerleaders we've ever 
had."

to start a cheer. (Photos by Tim Ross) 



To raise money for new 
uniforms and traveling 
expenses, the girls are 
holding bake sales. They also 
hope to hold a hay ride for 
athletes so they can get to 
know each other. 

The girls who are now 
cheering at soccer games 
will be cheering for 
basketball and baseball later 



this year. 

Although there is little 
recognition for their work 
and time, the girls feel it is 

worth it. " ... as long as it 
helps the teams," they 
agreed. 

They want to influence by 
example. "The more we try, 
people are going to see and 
say 'whatcanldo?'" 



The going gets tough 



By CHRIS PYLE 

"The girls had a lough 
week, but the team continues 
to hang in the game to the 
last point." said Coach 
Peggy Voisin of OPFW 
women'svolleyball team. 

Last week was a rough one 
for the spikers as they fell to 
Valparaiso, Goshen and St. 
Joseph Colleges. 

Tuesday, the spikers 
played division II 
Valparaiso, but lost on home 
territory 7-15, 15-9 and 5-15. 

Thursday's competition 
against Goshen and St 
Joseph presented a 
challenge for the Tuskers 
IPFW nearly walked away 
with a win in the opening 
game against Goshen. 12-15, 
but then dropped the second 
game. 5-15, and the match. 

St. Joseph was equally as 
challenging as the team 
captured a victory. 12-15. 2- 
15. 



Saturday's matches were 
more encouraging as the 
Tuskers carried home a 
victory against Huntington. 
Huntington won the first 
game 13-15. but the Tuskers 
took over, winning the next 
two games and the match 
with scores of 15-10 and 15-7. 
Then, the IPFW squad 
replayed a former rival. St. 
Joseph College. St. Joe won 
the first game. 1-15. The 
Tuskers made a comeback 
but lost the match in a 
squeaker, 13-15. 

The Spikers have reached 
the half-way mark in 
seasonal play. Voisin is 
optimistic about the rest of 
the season. "Things are 
looking better We still have 
our eye on the state tourney. 
We want to defend our title." 

In order to win the state 
crown, the team faces many 
more challenges and hours 
of practice At this point in 



time, the team is striving to 
improve in certain areas, in 
on defensive skills and of- 
fense and is trying to apply 
the right skills at the right 
time. According to Voisin, 
it'sa "partoflearnlng." 

The Spikers have added 
two to their family. Fresh- 



men Amy Arunow and Janet 
Braun, both from Concordia 
High School, will be con- 
tributing their services to the 
team. "Things are looking 
better," Voisin said. 

Over the next few weeks. 
the spikers will be meeting 
cross town rival St. Francis, 



Tti-State, and playing in the 
St. Mary's invitational, 
among others Their next 
and last home match will be 
against Grace and Glen Oaks 
at 6:00 p.m. on November 6. 
The match will be held at the 
Concordia gym.
