Parkinson Explains 
Law Of Delay 



"Work expands so os to 
fill the lime available for 
ils completion," says Pro- 
fessor C. Northcote Parkin- 
son in his world-famous 
book, PARKINSON'S LAW. 
He will appear here on Octo- 
ber 21 at 1:30 and 7:30 in 
the Student Lounge. 

The Professor has been 
a long-time analyst of the 
absurdities of the "laws" 
governing business opera- 
tions in big government, cor- 
porations, education and in 
smaller units right down to 
the family. This astute pro- 
bing into the inside workings 
of organizations has made 
him the darling of audiences 
in England as well as in 
the United States. 

Professor C. Northcote 
Parkinson is also ,h e au- 
thor of IN-LAWS AND OUT- 
LAWS, a book which ex- 
plores corporate climbing 
through such devious me- 
thods as marrying the boas s 
da UR hter,and THE LAW AND 
THE PROFITS, which delves 
into the reasons why expen- 

surpass) income. The Pro- 
fessor explains these au- 
gust findings in his lec- 
tures, as well as such rela- 
ted items as the cocktail 
party method of personacl 
seler-iion, how to manage 
(and mis-manage) your per- 
sonal finances, and how he 
discovered his now-famous 
lawa. A LAW UNTO THEM-

collection of portraits of II 
uncommon people who deep- 
ly influenced his life. LEFT

ible history of the 
Labour Party from Marx to 
Wilson. In late 1968, he re- 
turns to his inimitable 
tongue-in-cheek humor with 
a new "low" book entitled 
MRS. PARKINSON'S LAW 
m which he addresses him- 
5 bH to a distaff dilemma and 
proposes a deeply scienti- 
fic solution for the ladies on 
ihose days when everything 
seems to go wrong. 

One might come to the 
conclusion that Professor 
Parkinson is merely a humor- 
ist. On the contrary, he is 
noted also as a distinguished 
historian and educator. He 
has lectured on the pro- 
blems of taxation in En- 
gland and Scandinavia, and 
has taught history for many 
years on both sides of the 
Atlantic (including Indiana 
University and the Harvard 
Graduate School of Business 
\dminislration here, and the 
Royal Naval College, Dart- 
mouth, and the University of 
Liverpool in England). For

Student Body President Scott

Gillie should ask himself why- 
do many average Americana 
distrust the intellectual com- 
munity in the form of the 
universities. It may just 
be because they see very 
little intellectual in the be- 
havior of the so called in-

Kent Stale where a group of so 
called intellectuals (students) 
look it upon themselves to 
burn down a ROTC building 
simply because they did not 
like or trust the military. I 
ask Mr. Gillie is this the 
action of true intellectuals or 
the actions of ignorant savages 
who destroy anything thai 
they don't understand or trust. 
I do not feel it is com- 
ptelely just to view the major- 
ity of the university community 
as intellectual savages; how- 
ever, it is clear that if the 
intellectual community as a 
whole does not denounce his 
type -of savage intcllcclualism / 
the intellectual Community 
does not deserve its name.

Dear Editor; 

An article in ike Sept. 
J8th. issue of the COMMU- 
NIC A TOR outlined proposed 
changes in the student nr- 
livily fees. This change, 
proposed by Scott Gillie, 
would charge alt students an 
activities fee regardless of 
how many hours they are 
taking. Admittedly, this would 
reduce ihe charge to full' 

The fact Mr. Gillie fails 
to take into account is that 
the vast majority of the 3200 
people who would be forced 
to pay the fee would derive 
no benefit from it. These 
people are graduate and/or 
part-time students' who are 
working full time, have a 
family to support and either 
are unable and / or don't 



He, the undersigned, 
think Mr. Gille should con- 
sider all the facts before 
proposing changes such as 
this. 

If Mr. Gille fears that 
part— lime students are 
deriving benefits from the 
activities program without 
contributing, the answer

students activities pro-

With the Congressional elections coming in the near fu- 
ture, it is the responsibility of "We the People." to become 
involved in the election process, and to decide who is the 
best qualified to serve us. 

Through extensive research, on both candidates and by 
personal contact with both men, I have decided that Con- 
gressman E. Ross Adair is the best suited to be our repre- 
sentative in Washington. I would like now to share with you 
some of my reasons why I have reached this conclusion. 

Congressman Adair, by serving our district for some 
twenty years in the place where the political "action" is, 
has become very familiar with the problems of the day on'd 
with their solutions. And he knows how the people of the 
Fourth district feel on the issues of the day. (Any person 
who can be elected to twenty consecutive years in Congress, 
has got to be in "step" with the people of his district: it is 
a mere political fact.) 

Mr. Adair is also one of the most powerful Congressmen 
in Washington; and thus is very able to impliment Congres- 
sional movement, and to put our wisheB into positive action. 
Because he is thesenior Republican on the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee,' and has twenty years of seniority, he 
can do things thnt a new congressman cannot. 

I would now like to give you a few examples of what 
Congressman Adair has done in Washington for us. 

ON THE ENVIRONMENT: 

Adair introduced and voted for all of President Nixon's 
major proposals for pollution control. He originated legis- 
lature such as tax incentives to encourage voluntary efforts 
to curb pollution. He also assisted Fort Wayne in obtaining 
funds for storm sewers. 

ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS: 

Adair introduced and passed the "Peace with Justice 
Resolution," and the resolution condemning the treatment 
of American prisoners of war by the North Vietnam Commu- 
nists, and has just introduced the resolution which was con- 
sidered by the Foreign Affairs Committee to implement Pre- 
sident Nixon's plan to stop plane hijacking. He was alsc 
selected by the House to go to Asia and report on the pro- 

And finally, strongly believing this country must im- 
prove its quality of life, Mr. Adair has led successful efforts 
in slashing millions of dollars of wasteful foreign aid 
spending, and has strongly voted (in contrast with his 
Congressional opponent) for large reductions in our Space 
programs, in order to provide more money to solve our grave 
domestic problems. 

These are just a few of the many fnctsobout your pre- 
sent Congressman; now decide who you want to represent 
our district. I have ! ty Charles Braun

Roush ' That name is beginning to becom 
word throughout North Eastern Indiana. The name has a Ire- 
lous recognition factor, expecially here in Fort Wayne. 
One may see 20 to 30 car bumpers a day proclaimiag that 
: on a blue shoe sole type sticker. From those three 
who journeyed to the moon to the janitor working 
rom 12:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. in a small local business, the 
iBme is welt known. 

Whnl may surprise you when considering the popularity 
;nd recognition of Ed Roush is the fact that he is a relative 
lewcomer to the local political scene. He first entered 4th 
listrict congressional politics just two years and five months 
go. That was in 1968. As late as August of that year Roush 
ad a recognition factor of 17%. At the same time his in- 
umbant had an almost complete recognition factor. 

Yet, this man, whose name we're all so familiar with 
ow, ran what all thought in 1966 was an impossible political 
ampaign. 

Ed replied to this spirit of pessimism by taking off his 
uit jacket, putting on his walking shoes, sticking his chin up 
nd walking out to meet the voters. 

He lost that year by 2% of the total vote cast. Ed Roush 
arrowed an "impossible gap" and barely lost to a "popular 
ncumbant" in a "heavily Republican year." 

This year, in 1970, Ed Roush has . j Usr.-j th.ii gap. 
Ed is winning for the very simple reason that he has taken 
politics right back to where it belongs: to the people! Those 
f you sitting at your tables at 9:00 a.m. in the morning down 
i the cafeteria when Ed Roush came over to you, sat down 
.itli you to talk and listen, know what I mean when I say he 
takes politics "to the people". 

Roush was bom in Oklahoma and his family moved north 

to Huntington, Indiana when he was still a small child. His 

,rly development was guided by the Huntingtoa elementary 

d High schools. He attended Huntington College and gradu- 

ed from the Indiana University School of Law. 

In the army during the war Roush ruse through the ranks 
jm private to captain. He served as Prosecuting Attorney of 
jf Huntington County from 1955 to 1959. 

He first ran for Congress in 1958 and was re-elected again 
n 1960, 1962, 1964, 1966. In the latter part of his fifth term 
:he State Congressional Districts were rearranged and Roush's 
ounty of Huntington was thrown into the 4th Congrcs-

A new dimension of liberation is the key to o relevant 
Block Theology. The Old and New Testaments ate important 
because in them God is revealed as a God who is involve 
history, effecting new forms of human life in the world. Every 
human order stands under his judgment because only God 
absolute. That is why again and again in the Bible a ne 
order is expected which will come into being because of God' 
decision to make human life really human. This is to say thai 
the Bible is pervasively eschatologieal; that is, it look: 
the future, to a time when the new will displace the old. 

Black Theology believes that we are on the threshold of 
of a new order - the order of a new block community,

iEKS POLL... 
cont. (ram pg. 1 

responses and 28% marked 
"much value," 37% "some 
value," 22% "little value," 
and 13% "no value." Of 
course the word choice is 
a little hazy, but it does 
seem that there is support 
for' the varsity athletic pro- 
gram and that Mr. Gillie may 
have his hands full if he 
attempts to reduce the var- 
sity athletic budget- 

The seventh question 
was "Do you feel that the 
student government has 
done a good job- of commu- 
nicating with the student 
body this year?" Only 26% 
of the responders answered 
"yes" with 46% answering 
"no" and 28% answering 
"don't know." The results 
from this question would 
seem to indicate that the 
student government is going 
to-have to improve its corn- 
students, but the 28% "don't 
knows" would seem to in- 
dicate that the students 
are going to have to be a 
willing and attentive au- 
dience. 

The eighth question

■was "What grade would you 
give the student government 
for its overall performance 
this year?" It would seem 
that the responders were 
pretty tight with their 
grades with only 1% giving 
A's, 15% B, 58% C, 24% D, 
and 2% F. It would seem 
that while most students are 
not elated with the perfor- 
mance of the student govern- 
ment, they do feet that it is 
doing an adequate Job. 

The ninth question was 
"What grade would you 
give Student Body Presi- 
dent Scott Gillie for his 
overall performance this 
year?" Opinion seemed to 
be a little more polarized 
with 5% giving an A, 28% 
B, 40% C, 17% D, and |0% 
F. Once again it would 
seem that a majority of the 
responders feel that Mr. 
Gillie is doing at least an 
adequate job- 
Two responders, who 
indicated that they were 
black, labelled the poll 
"for whites only" and indi- 
cated that the student go- 
vernment and its goals were 
not relevant to them as 
blacks and were for whites 

Some responders felt 
that the poll was being con- 
ducted by student govern- 
ment. This is not the case. 
The polls are being con- 
ducted by Alpha Epsilon 
Kappa fraternity as a non- 
partisan effort to illu- 
minate trends In student 
opinion.
