By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 

Editor-in-Chief 

the bylaws explicated in the EPFW 
Students' (Government Constitution and 
Bylaws were violated in Ihe ad- 
ministration of this year's election. 

Al least five procedures outlined in 
Ihe Bylaws and Constitution were not 
followed by the Student Body 
Hresident, Joseph Motherwell, and Ihe 
members of Students' Government. 
These violations have caused delays in 
publicizing the election, which as of 
'I'uesday. was scheduled for Tuesday 
and Wednesday, April 7 and 8. 

'Ibe violated bylaws include Ihe 
following: 

— The President must submil 
nominations for the Election Board to 
the Student Senate six weeks prior to 
the election, 

— Student Senators shall screen and 
approve five election board members 
and two alternates four weeks prior to 
the election. 

— lite Student Senate shall announce 
the Election Board members and Iheir 
alternates no later than six weeks prior 
to Ihe election dale 

— TIte Election Board shall publicize 
one month before the election. Ihe 
positions up for election, the time and 
place of the election, the qualifications 
lor voters, the campaign spendinj? 
limits for candidates seeking elected 

— 'Ihe Election Board must receive 
completed petitions no later than one 
week prior lo the general elections, 

Motherwell did not submit the names 
of the Election Board to Students' 
Government until lasl week. Con- 
sequeiiliy. Ihe board was not approved 
until [aler in the week, three weeks 
later than is required by Ihe bylaws 
The boards membership therefore 
could not be announced by the Senate 
uiilil last week, live weeks later than 
required by Ihe bylaws Publication 
and advertisement of the election and 
the election code did not occur until lasl 
Monday, three weeks later than 
required by the bylaws. Finally, since 
die pclitions were not distributed to the 
geiK-ral student body until Monday 

IPFW wins 
national 
speech title 

BySTACEYSCllAAB 

Gwen Auld and Gina Koslotl. 
members of the IPFW Forensic 
L^eague. won die national title in 
dramatic duo at the Delta Sigma Kho- 
Tau Kappa Alpha I'ournamenl and 
Conference held at the University of 
Mississippi, Oxford, Miss,, recently. 

USIi-1'KA is a national honorary 
loreiisics fraternity, whose mem- 
bership is based on seholaslic 
achievement and competitive activity. 
The annual tournament and conference 
drew S4 schools and more than 400 
participants. 

Auld and Kostoff beat out more than 
Hi other dramatic duo teams with their 
interpretationof 'Final Placemen!" by 
Ara Watson. 

For her performances throughout the 
season, Auld has qualified in prose 
interpretation lor the American 
Forensic Association tournament held 
this spring in San Diego, Califorma 
Kostoff is an alternate to the AFA 
lournamenl in poetry interprelation. 

Al the Indiana State Individual 
Events tournament. Auld was named 
Slate cliampion in prose, received a 
hfth place in poetry, and a fifth place in 
dramatic duo with her parlner John 
Brouwer. Brouwer received a second 
place in after-dinner speaking, a fifth 
place in prose, a third place m dramatic 
duo with his partner Mall Precise, and 
sixth place in both poetry inlerprelalion 
and impromptu speaking. 

Precise, a novice this year, received 
fifth place in bolh novice informative 
speaking and novice prose in- 
terpretation 

Auld and Kostoff traveled lo the AFA 
qualifying tournament at Bradley 
University. Bolh members did well 
with Kostoff gaining sixlh place in 



when Ihe posters and election code 
were hung up in buildings across 
campus, candidates could not submit 
their completed petitions one full week 
prior to the elections, something also 
required by the bylaws. 

According to the Constitution, such 
violations of Ihe bylaws are grounds for 
impeachment and recall of the officer 
responsible for the violations. 

Motherwell said he tried almut a 
month ago to recruit students lo serve 
on the Election Board, but no one was 
interested in doing it, 

Phil Downs, who has served as 
parliamentarian for Students' 
Government, is riiiining lor the position 
ol .Students Government vice 



president. Consequently. Downs had lo 
resign his position as parliamentarian, 
I his left that position vacant at a lime 
when, according to the bylaws, a 
parliamentarian is needed to 'cerlify 
those candidates receiving Ihe highest 
vole totals'" 

Gina Kostoff. who has served as 
student body vice president, has 
therelore rteigned her position to serve 
as parliamenlarian, since no other 
students were reeruiled to fill Ihe 
vacancy. She said her resignation was 
effeclive Tuesday night, March 31 

In light of the fact that the general 
student body was nol even aware of Ihe 
eleclion until last Monday, Kosloff said 



she was planning to propose to 
Students* Government at this week's 
Senate meeting that they postpone Ihc 
elections for two weeks, making the 
elections on April 21 and -a. John 
Ulmer. dean of student affairs und 
advisor lo Studenls* Government, said 
Tuesday that he would support such a 
proposal Motherwell said he also 
would support such a proposal. 

The nominations for Ibe Eleclion 
Board ihat were presented lo the 
Sludent Senate lasl week include the 
following students: Mequanent 
Ueyissa, Jacques Chansavang. Holly 
Lowe. Lewis Papie. Karan Ford, Handy 
Wen and Jim Wert. 




Ministry links academics with faith 



At pioliably no other time does an 
individual doubt their faith and search 
lor aitswers to questions about their 
taith tlian when in college. 

"But titai doubt is healthy," the 
Keverend Margaret MeCray -Worrall. 
IPFW's campus mimsler, said. 'Its 
important to let students know they 
luive the freedom and responsibility lo 
make their own decisions about Ihal." 

Ihat idea has become the mission ol 
the Greater Fort Wayne Campus 
Ministry. "We try to help Ihe person as 
a whole deal with their problems and 



Iheir situation where they are at now.' 
Ben Wiseman. Campus Ministry s 
administrative secretary, said. 

From the period of January I9B6 to 
December 1986. Campus Ministry 
served 57 students and faculty. Those 57 
individuals she said, account for 2W 
counseling hours for 1986. 

The diocese, Mc Cray- Worrall said, 
also will add a nun on staff to serve as a 
Catholic Campus Minisler She will 
work at IPFW and Indiana Tech and be 
supervised by Father Schooler, 
ying to do 



publicity and make our ministry more 
obvious." McCray-Worrall said. 

That responsibility rests on Ihe 
shoulders of Wiseman who joined 
Campus Ministry last November. Part 
ol Wiseman's job includes publicity. 
handhng adverlising, constnicting, and 
laying out news letters and brochures 
published by Campus Ministry 

■I would like to see studenls be more 
willing and able to talk openly about 
their faith," McC ray -Worrall said. 
"Ihe spiritual life can't t&gt;e divorced 
from the academic life! "

Fair elections doubtful 



Serious violations of the IPFW 
Students' Government Constitution have 
surfaced this week, creating possibly the 
largest controversy thus tar for this 
year's continuaily-troubjed student 
administration. 

IPFW students were not aware until 
Tuesday Uial election of student 
representatives would be taking place 
next week Signs posted on campus 
soliciting candidates indicate that 
anyone wishing to fill a seat needs all 
completed material submitted by 
Friday to be considered a nominee. 

These are only two of the many con- 
stitution violations that have come to 
light this week, creating many questions 
as to the fairness of this year's elections. 

According to regulation, Student Body 
President Joe Motlienvell should have 
submitted nominations to the student 
senate for an election board over six 
weeks ago. The purpose of this board is 
to administer all campus-wide elections, 
including the publicizing of positions 
available. This board however, was not 
appointed until last week, with the last 
two members being announced this past 
weekend. Violation number one. 

Four weeks ago, the names of students 
chosen to serve on the committee were 
to be approved by the student senate. 
Considering the above, obviously we now 
have violation number two! 

It is staled very clearly in the con- 
stitution that one month prior to election 
date, which is always on the first 
Tuesday and Wednesday in April, the 
newly-appointed election board is to 
publicize the positions up for election, 
the time and places of the voting, the 
qualifications for voters and the cam- 
paign spending limits for those seeking 
elected offices. The board is responsible 
for conspicuous postings of this in- 
formation in all IPFW buildings. We will 
group all these together and label them 
"violation number three " 



The election board is to receive all 
completed petitions from candidates no 
later than one week prior to the general 
elections. This is to allow ample time for 
individual campaigning and necessary 
equal coverage m the campus 
newspaper. Due to not naming a com- 
mittee on time, this year the deadline for 
petition submission has been extended 
one week, allowing only one full day 
(Monday) between filing deadline and 
election day. You guessed it ... violation 
number four. 

Considering these factors, there 
presently is no way there can be a fair 
election here at IPFW this year. 
Procrastination has killed any chance 
for that. It IS especially surprising that 
this has happened when you consider 
Motherwell, student body president for 
the past two years, has been through the 
election process at least twice. 

Prior to this week, the only people 
knowing of the upcoming election and 
announcing their candidacies are those 
already involved in Students' Govern- 
ment, This is not fair representation of 
the student body. They have had time to 
prepare strategies and campaign 
materials. At this point, anyone else, 
regardless of their credentials will be 
the heavy underdog, a "dark horse" 
without a chance. 

The least that can be done at this point 
to help remedy the situation would be to 
postpone the elections a week or two to 
allow ample campaigning time for all 
candidates. This would allow adequate 
coverage of issues and announcements 
of individual campaign strategies. 

It is a shame that the current student 
officers have to end the school year in 
controversy. The only advantage to this, 
however, is that now we can look for- 
ward to starting the year with a new face 
at the helm. When looking back over this 
past year, one realizes that things can 
only get better.

Supreme court ruling slashes rights for men 



Beering gives his word 



Webster defines the word rhetoric as 
pieaning "the art of using words ef- 
fectively in speaking or writing, 
especially, now, the art or science-ef 
literary composition, particularly in 
prose, including the use of figures of 
speech." 

Rhetoric : something to which all those 
attending Purdue University President 
Steven Beering's address to faculty on 
Thursday, March 26, were subjected 

"I'm really open to anything that 
makes this campus better," Beering told 
the audience. 

"I want this campus and this city to 
have the finest M.B.A. program 
available. 

We consider this campus a showpiece 
for higher education in our state," he 
said. 

Why did Beering address the faculty in 
the manner he did'' Had he hoped to 
paint a pretty picture to convince people 
that all is right and just at IPFW today? 
It is our hope that he would have realized 
that would be a futile task 

Did he really think this possible, even 
after himself admitting to the faculty 
and staff that the picture and future of 
IPFWs Master of Business 
Administration degree was very 
muddled'' 

Did he really believe that the faculty 
and staff could be persuaded by his 
rhetoric? Come on ... give everyone at 
IPFW a little credit. 

The Indiana Commission for Higher 
Education still has not approved the 
M.B.A. The General Assembly still has 
yet to approve $225,000 for the program 
to cover the costs of implementation and 
the hiring of new faculty. 

The state and IPFW representatives 
apparently part company at this point. 
According to the House of Represen- 
tatives, S225,ti00 will be administered 
from lU-Bloomington having IPFW act 
as a host campus IPFW would rather 



have the degree included in its own 
campus budget, giving it control over 
the program. Beering said he would like 
to see the program be administered 
from Bloomington because of their 
business school's reputation. 

What is happening here? Hasn't IPFW 
proved itself enough to Beering? Does he 
think our administrators and faculty are 
not competent enough to manage an 
M.B.A. program'' Does bethink it would 
lose its impact, being an IPFW degree 
program, rather than a statewide 
program? 

If IPFW is to be a higher education 
showpiece for the rest of the state, 
shouldn't its faculty be allowed to have 
an M.B.A, program that would properly 
serve its students? 

If Beering is open-minded to 
everything that would make this campus 
better as he told the faculty last Thurs- 
day, how can he look these people in the 
eye and say that he would rather see the 
M.B.A, program be administered from 
Bloomington'' This is yet another 
example of the tight-fisted control that 
powers outside Fort Wayne have on this 
campus and its administrators. 

Beering went so far at the (acuity 
convocation to say that he would "love to 
see (IPFW) develop programs that 
would parallel what (the main cam- 
puses) will be doing," lU has their 
M,B.A. program, why couldn't IPFW 
parallel that with their own'' What are 
we to believe^ Was Beering sincere or 
just humoring us? 

IPFW. the Fort Wayne business 
communitv, and the students served by 
IPFW deserve an M.B.A. program. It is 
long overdue. It is time that Beering 
adhere to his word on this matter and 
work to "do anything that makes this 
campus better." 

He gave everyone his word that day. 
We'll all be watching to make sure he 
sticks to it.

Indiana's win a hoosiers dream 



.By CLIFF STOCKAMP 
Siatt Writer 

Fir.s! of all an apology is in 
order. 1 made reference last 
week to "Hoosiers," no not 
(he team, but the movie! I 
guess not everyone had seen 



Commentary 



It yet. but I'm sure it's just a 
mailer of lime, especially 
alter Monday night. If the 
game last Monday elicited 
any reactions, you should 
have seen the movie, and 
vice versa. 

Anyway, it's only ap- 
propriate lliat the movie was 
released the same year 
Indiana won the National 
Championship. I think the 
big Coach in the sky, (and 
that s not the one wearing a 
red sweater eitheri knew 
what was going to happen. I 
would guess he is pretty 
smart alioui Ihoie llungs, 



land that's not giving 
relerence lo Smart who 
played pretty). Poor Jim, he 
probably couldn't wait to get 
oul of the gym. 

1 wonder what Gene 
iKeady that is, nol Hack- 
man) thought of the 
Hoosiers^ I bet i three to one 
odds) thai he thinks his team 
couid have gone alt the way, 
especially knowing that they 
lieat Indiana during the 
year. Uh well Gene, you win 
some and you lose some 
igameti and hairs). 

This is definilely Hoosier 
Country. Just drive through 
a housing edition sometime 
and just look at all the 
driveways with basketball 
goals by them. 

Dioves came into the 
restaurant where I work 
Tuesday all excited about 
the game, it was definitely 
TllE THING to Ulk about. 
What surprised me is how 
involved these older people 
were with the Indiana 



basketball team. ^, ^ , 

It i ever do leave lliis bool- 
shaped slate, I'll always call 
it home, Jusl like that 
moving phrase on lire In- 
diana license plales says, 
"Back Home Again in In- 
diana," ril always call it 
home, God, I'm so proud lo 
be a Hoosier. Red and while 
are even my favorite colors, 
I'm going lo make them my 
wedding colors someday .,, 
and it will be some day, 
someday m Indiana! 



Joyce and Johnson were 
both considered qualified for 
ihe job and given oral 
exams, Johnson scored a 75 
on the exam and Joyce a 73. 
A supervisor picked Johnson 
for the job, but Joyce was 
ultimalely being hired for 
the posiUon, This lead to 
Johnson hiring a lawyer and 
sueing ,_. for .reverse - 
discrimination. 

The supreme court ruling 
in favor of Joyce . allows 
preferential U-eaimenl lo be 
given lo women. This is 
wrong! Equality is right, 
and something lo be (ought 
(or, Bui lo be placed in a job, 
even though second best, is 
condescending and just plain 
nol fair lo men. 

II is evident that Johnson 
was more qualified than 
Joyce. Why? Nine more 
, yeare of service speaks for 
itself. He scored iwo more 
points above Joyce's score 
on Ihe exam. It's not much to 
be sure, but a higher score is 



a higher score whether il is 
one fourlh of a point or 50 
points higher. 

This ruling is in favor of 
employers actively engaging 
in intentional discrimination 
ot men. 



)Ughl 



If equality iswhai 
for in a job. Ilien n 
die decision is a jusl one. If 
rin.given a job over a man X 
want lo know that I'm a 
more {|ua)ified person. I do 
nol want to be put in a' 
position Ijecause il justifies a 
supreme court ruling. This 
law undermines all thai 
women have worked for. It is 
ultimately slating thai yes, 
we know you're nol qualified 
over men, but we'll give you 
Ihe job anyway lo silence 
your voice, 
- ■ This IS nol equal rights. It 
is a patsy undermining men 
and women. And in this case,

Iiave been participating 
the lun runs that have said 
they would like to run this

what their school schedule 
will be iiojil fall. We can't

iiur inlormol runs," KasI 
said. 

KasI is also recruiting 
Irom the local high schools. 
"We have some good 
recruils Irom Ihe high

I'm enthused," Coach KasI 
Siiid, 

The cross country team 
has meets scheduled on 
Saturdays and some Fridays 
in Ihe lall. Last year KasI 
lud no women runners for a 
women's team. This year he

lunning cross country. He 
needs live lo have a team.

-I'm really pleased with

even more popular than
