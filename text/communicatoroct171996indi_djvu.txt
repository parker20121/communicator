Students help rebuild city 



by Jen my Ecenbarger 
News Editor 

People of all ages are con- 
stantly tn iiD' to find things 
to improve Individually, 
people sort through ideas in their 
mind, in hopes of benefiting their 
community Together, however, peo- 
ple lake their ideas and bring forth 
changes. 

The Fort Wayne neighborhoods 
along 




group of interested people will meet 
to discuss urban problems and possi- 
ble design solutions 

The project organizer is Matthew 



Kubik, associate professor of archi- 
tectural engineering and technology 
and president of the Fort Wayne 
Chapter of the American Institute of 
Architects (AJA). 

The group will include represen- 
tatives of the Fort Wayne AIA; Fort 
Wayne Department of Community 
Development and Planning; neigh- 
borhood associations of the city's 
South Side; area businesses; and 
ARCH, the historic preser- 
vation society. 

The project is part of the AIA 
statewide effort. 

Furthermore. 24-30 students 
from IPFW, Ball State University 
and South Side High School will 
help with the designs The IPFW 
students are architectural engineer- 
ing technology majors, while the 
Ball State students are from (he 
class of Tony Coslello in the 
department of architecture 
Costetlo is also president of AIA. 
South Side students are from the 
honors class of Mike Ankenbrook. 

The general public is invited to 
stop and observe the proceedings at 



any time. 

"We have a strong departmental 
tradition of service learning," said 
Kubik. "Our students have worked 
on many community projects " 

Today at 6 p.m., the project wUI 
begin at the West Central 
Community Center, 1316Broadway. 
The evening will begin with a com- 
munity meeting in which urban 



FAST benefits 
perspective students 



by Josh Sprungcr 
Chief Reporter 

In the past, teen-age students 
have often been filled with many 
unanswered questions involving 
their futures. Currently, however, a 
program has been established to 
make the tradition from high school 
to college much easier. 

As a result of the work of two 
D?FW professors and several Fort 
Wayne Community Schools 
(FWCS) teachers, middle and high 
school students now bave access to 
additional help in math, reading, 
writing, life skills and making col- 



lege decisions. 

In 1987, the Future Academic 
Scholar's Track (FAST) Program 
was designed to help Fort Wayne 
students make academic decisions 
The program offers financial 
advice, slates the importance of fur- 
ther education and offers actual 
classes to introduce its participants 
to the college atmosphere 

"They gave me a lot of informa- 
tion on bow to get into college and 
encouraged me to stay in school." 
said Cindy Carona, a freshman at 
IPFW and one of the several stu- 
dents who were program partici- 
pants. "I really wasn't thinking

problems will be discussed. The 
group will later be broken down into 
smaller teams to focus on design 
solutions It will close with the teams 
reporting their discoveries, ending 
the project at around 11 p.m. 

Cm Friday, from 7 to 3 p.m., pro- 
fessional architects will work side by 
side with the students in order to pre- 
pare sketches, drawings and designs 



based on the findings from the day 
before. 

Later, at 3:30 and 6 p.m., they 
will present their design proposals. 

"This is an exciting experience in 
interactive design, bringing archi- 
tects into direct partnership with the 
community leaders." said Kubik 

Kubik says that the series of 
graphic images and plans will be the 



basis of focused city planning and a 
starting point for conversation 
among neighborhood representa- 
tives and city planners. 

"We want to make good architec- 
ture and planning visible in Fort 
Wayne." said Kubik. 

For more information, call 
Kubik at 481-6581.

about going to college before I par- 
ticipated in FAST They convinced 
me to go (to college) and that is why 
I chose IPFW." 

FAST is funded by the 
Foellinger Foundation and 
area businesses. 

Students must be recommended 
in writing by their math, science and 
English teachers. Approval must 
also be given by the student's 
principal. 



"Our goal is to educate and 
encourage students about the impor- 
tance of higher education," said 
Hernando Eslevez, adviser and 
coordinator for FAST. 

Marcia Y. Tapp-Sanders is the 
program director. 

There are 96 students enrolled in 
FAST this year. Classes will meet 
from 8 a.m. until noon every other 
Sunday beginning October 26. 

"It was like a miniature college 



experience The classes were in dif- 
ferent buildings and we bad a little 
break in between," said Carlos 
Hamilton, a freshman who was also 
a previous participant in the pro- 
gram. "It gave us a chance to see 
what it's like to go to a class in a lec- 
ture ball and laboratory" 

The classes made available with- 
in FAST are academic in nature, but 
also involve personal development 
and leadership skills. 



"The lessons were so practical 
and changed so often that it kept 
learning fresh," said HamiltOD. 
"They taught us about conducting 
employment interviews, writing 
resumes and other things that they 
do not offer in high school but what 
any person would need to get 
through life." 

The program is cost free and 
transportation is provided. 



Speaker lectures on ethnic images in media 



by Tanisba Washington 
SUIT Writer and 
Jeremy Ecenbarger 
News Editor 

All white men arc supremacists; 
all black men belong to gangs; all 
blonde women arc stupid; all black 
women are on welfare; all Spanish 
men are uneducated... the list never 
ends. These stereotypes are conlinu- 
ally placed into peoples' minds as a 
result of being influenced by the 
mass media. 

Today, a discussion on ethnic 
images and issues in the media will 
kick off a series of speeches hosted 
by Multicultural Services. 

"Ninety percent of our students 
are Caucasian and many, if not most, 
of those students do not live in 
diverse neighborhoods," said 
Christine Patterson, director of 
Multicultural Services. "Many of 
their perceptions (of people of other 
races and from other cultures) come 
from the media, and if the only time 
you see a person of color on televi- 
sion or in the newspapers is in rela- 
tion to a crime, then of course you 
think 'they axe all criminals.'" 



N. Frank Ukadike, assistant pro- 
fessor of communication and Afro- 
American studies at the University 
of Michigan, will present 
"Ethnocentrism and Amer- 
ican Media." 

The event is sponsored by 



Services. 



the 



Multicultural 
Department of 
Communication 
and the French 
Club. 

Organizers of 
the speech and 
discussion hope 
that it will 
enlighten partic- 
ipants on how 
diversity, culture 
and race are 
treated in the 

press, broadcast journalism and the 
entertainment industry. 

Ukadike has a PhD in cinema 
studies from New York University. 
He has taught several ethnic-related 
courses including: African Cinema, 
Cultural Issues in Cinema, 
Perspectives in Third World Media, 
Introduction to African Studies and 
others. He works and lectures at uni- 




versities across the country. 

Ukadike's body of work also 
includes a number of publications 
related to Him and ethnocentrism. 

"Many impressions or stereotypes 
one has about people of other groups 
are often based on what one sees via 
the media," said Patterson. "Our 
goal is for the campus and all of the 
students to be more conscious of 
what they are viewing and then 
question whether what they are see- 
ing is reality ." 

Ukadike's speech is simply an 
extension of classroom curriculum, 
said John Parrish-Sprowl, depart- 
ment of communication chair 

According to Parrish-Sprowl, 
Ukadike's speech is simply an exten- 
sion of the classroom curriculum. 
"The professor's work is important 
and it is germane to the courses we 
teach. The department believes that 
intercultural and multicultural Issues 
are vitally important because they 
are pan of every interaction whether 
we are aware of it or not and the 
more we understand each other, the 
better communicators we become " 

The lecture will begin at 7:30 pjn 
in the Classroom-Medical Building, 



Room 159, Admission is free. 

"Naturally, a university is where 
we try to educate people to under- 
stand that what they have been 
taught to believe via the media is not 
necessarily true," said Patterson.

Houseman choice 
for students, Indiana 



In case you have been living in a 
cave for the last month or two. 
Indiana's fourth district will be 
choosing either Gerry Houseman, 
Democrat: Ken Bisson, Libertarian; 
or Mark Souder, [he Republican 
incumbent to represent tbem in 
Washington Tor the next two years 

As students we cannot support 
Mark Souder. He has drastically 
reduced funding for higher educa- 
tion. At IPFW, the average age of 
students is 27 Many of us rely on 
financial aid to complete our studies 
to provide a better life for ourselves 
and our families. Souder wants to 
cut the amount of people who 



the bouse? 

Ken Bisson we know very little 
about Bisson advocates disman- 
tling welfare. 

"It is lime to end welfare — peri- 
od," Bisson said. We do not agree 
with his simplistic solution to a 
complicated problem. Most of the 
Libertarian rhetoric is full of ele- 
mentary answers to graduate school 
questions and Bisson seems to fol- 
low their doctrine closely. 

Houseman on the other hand, 
approaches situations pragmatically. 
He has the maturity and indepen- 
dence we need to represent us 
Probably the main reason we 
support 
Houseman is his 
stance on educa- 
tion. He believes 
no one should be 
turned away from 
higher education 
because of finan- 
cial reasons. 

He sup- 
ports giving chil- 
dren who live in 
poor districts the 
chance to receive 
an education 
equal to those in 
affluent districts. 
Houseman 
believes there 
should be com- 
puters in every

Souder also supported a bill thai the US. enter the next ceniury as

Souder has pledged to take only 
a third of his campaign money from 
PACS. Most of the PACS He takes 
money from arc businesses with 
agendas behind their reason to sup- 
port a candidate 

Houseman also receives a good 
portion of his money from PACS 
To the tune of 55 percent of bis 
funds, but the difference between 
him and Souder lies within who is 
giving the money Souder takes big 
business money whereas Houseman 
receives funding from labor unions

Houseman will not be a rubber 
stamp for each Democratic propos- 
al. He has his own mind and he can 
make bis own choices. 

The choices are clear. Houseman 
is the man for Indiana's 4th district 
He has the knowledge and common 
sense to lead us. 

Souder's vision is not bis own. 
He's a follower and what we des- 
perately need is a leader with bis 
own mind. 

His vision leads us to believe he 
thinks more of how his fellow 
Republicans perceive him rather 
than how he is serving the people 
who elected him.

Letters to the Editor 



Religion different from God 



To the editor 

I don't want to beat to death the 
issue you've been addressing in The 
Communicator, but I do want to 
share one last thing with your paper. 
By the way, thank you for printing 
tny first response in one of your 

You did a lot of questioning of 
the concept of religion in your last 
piece. You also brought up a lot of 
issues related to homosexuality and 
the church, etc. My response in 
general is about the misconceptions 
many people (including 

"Christians") have about the con- 
cept of religion. 

My particular thoughts, opin- 
ions, or beliefs (or yours) about 
homosexuality are irrelevant to this 
issue. The way I look at it, that is a 
secondary issue, behind a more 
important idea. The bottom line is 
this: we all live with our own belief 
systems - that will never change, 
except when we choose to change 
tbem. 

About the misconception of reli- 
gion. I'm so glad to bear people 
question it, even reject it, because 
they're on the right track! ! 
Religion, in and of itself, is dead. It 



cannot bring life, change hearts. 
affect anything for good. People get 
turned off talking about religion. I 
don't blame them. 

The misconception people have 
(for no fault of their own) is that 
Christianity is about being "reli- 
gious." To some 
Christians it is all gsssiiii^sss 
about being reli- 
gious, but they don't 
have a clue, in my 
opinion. They may 
appear "good" on 
the surface, but can 
come across as being 
very judgmental, 
bigoted, hypocriti- 
cal, and legalistic, 
among other things 
They attend church, 
and that's about it. 
Very sad. 

Real Christianity 
is not about religion = 

at all. It is about a 
person and a relationship, not an 
organization. It is unique to all the 
faiths of the world. Its central focus 
is, or should be. the Person of Jesus 
Christ. 

When It becomes "real" in a per- 
son's life, there is supernatural 



transformation And, although 
Christians place their faith in Christ 
and the Bible, meaning consequent- 
ly the acceptance of a Biblical set of 
lifestyle principles, they have no 
place to judge or condemn others. 
As a matter of fact, committed 
Christians are 



taught to uplift 
others. They con- 
sider themselves 
sinners, saved by 
the grace of God, 
and are in no way 
without sin. 

According 
to the Bible, that 
is where Christ 
comes in - He is 
the only bridge 
between God and 
man. To "bom- 
again" believers, 
He is the only 
■— hope for the 
redemption of 
man. 

This is basically it It is not 
about being religious. Thai's the 
way I'd like for others (who are not 
Christians) to understand it. And, it 
is not a closed group. Everyone is 
welcome just as they are. 



Real 
Christianity is 

not ABOUT 

religion at all. 

it is about a 

Person and a 

relationship 



It is up to Christ, working in a 
Christian's life, to transform an 
open heart. To me personally, it is 
the greatest thing in my life. There 
are a lot of other misconceptions or 
misunderstandings about the 
Christian faith, some of which you 
mentioned in your article. They are 
very prevalent. For example, there 
is the misconception that in the 
Bible, women are "stifled" or mis- 
treated. According to scripture, they 
are to be honored. (My wife, for 
one. would tell you that ) I'll be glad 
to find the supportive verses for you 
at any lime 

I've included some awesome 
information I found on the Web. It 
really tells it like it is, in distin- 
guishing between knowing Christ 
and being "religious." 

Paul, my intention is to possibly 
clear up confusion there may be 
with the issue of religion vs. the 
Christian life. If you would like to 
share it with readers, feel free. I 
truly hope our communication stays 
open. 

Thanks for listening to me 
unload.

Christ meant for everyone 



To the Editor, 

I would like to comment about my beliefs 
because tbey are different from yours, although I 
believe you and I have some things in common. 
For instance, I am also a baptized Catholic 
although I also attended 12 years of parochial 
school. This meant litde to me untU I was 19. 
Also I struggle with homosexual temptation I 
believe I felt just like you for 19 years of my life. 

However, today 1 think I'm very different. 
You said you don't believe in religion. Neither 
do I. But you don't believe because of what oth- 
ers have done. I don't believe in religion either, 
to i point, because people are involved. People 
nuke mistakes. Look at the holy wars, inquisi- 
tions and crusades. This is the fault of man, not 
God. I've come to accept that people aren't per- 
fect, but God is infallible. You said that you find 
it hard to believe God ordered another person to 
kill someone else because they bad a different 
religion, and yet God chose non-Jewish people in 
the genealogy of Jesus. 

The ancestry of Jesus can be traced back to 
King David who was the son of Jesse who was 
the son of Ruth who was a non-Jew. You also 
mention that the Bible demoralizes women and 
people who have no control over their lives. And 
yet the Bible is full of courageous women like 
Ruth, Mary, Hanna, Abigail and Deborah. The 
Christian churches recognize these women as 
significant and encourages us to follow tbeir 
example. 

In regard to the Bible condemning people 



who don't have control over their lives, look at 
Jesus who was sent to set people free and give 
them control over themselves. God has given me 
power to overcome temptations and has set my 
soul free from this world. If you're finding that 
a part of your life is uncontrollable, maybe Jesus 
could help. He did for me. 

You compared the death of Jesus to that of 
Susan Smith's children. I would like to point out 
some differences. Jesus died, yet rose again on 
the third day and appeared to many people. In 
addition, the death of Jesus has the potential of 
paying the penalty for every human being's sins. 
This is because Jesus is God and the ramifica- 
tions of His death are infinite. 

Jesus was also sinless. To those who accept 
this the benefit is eternal life. Jesus continues to 
change peoples' lives today for the better. Jesus 
also ascended to heaven in front of his friends. 
The children of Susan Smith did not do this nor 
was their death the fulfillment of hundreds of 
years of Jewish prophecy. 

The author of the Bible is God. Christians 
believe the people who wrote the Scriptures were 
inspired by God and we use it as a guide for our 
lives today. The teachings in the Bible are worth 
applying to our lives. If you want a Bible to 
read, read the New International Version. It's 
clear, faithful to the original Hebrew and Greek, 
and easy to understand. 

I believe in worshiping God. To put some 
other human being in God's place is useless. 
Only God can satisfy the deepest longings of our 
heart. God has shown me that I'm loved just the 



way I am. God made me unique and gave me 
gifts which are beautiful. I figure that God is 
worthy of my praise because He has done this for 
me. God has set me free from trying to be like 
others. Why should 1 play some game with 
myself? In the end I'll have to live with myself 
for the rest of my life any way. 

It's loo bad you only believe in what you see. 
But I sympathize with you. It's lough but cot 
impossible. I know God has revealed Himself lo 
me in very concrete ways. I hope you to come to 
this point in your life. 

The fact thai others don't believe in God I'm 
sure provides some security but I know that 
majority isn't always right. The fact that you 
know many people who believe in only the visi- 
ble world doesn't negate the existence of God. 
God exists and rules over the world whether we 
believe it or not. Christ is meant for everyone 
and I have found more freedom in Jesus than you 
will ever know until you accept God 1 have 
found more love in God in regard lo the struggle 
with homosexuality than any person of either sex 
could provide. Jesus Christ is the Savior of the 
world. 

"Come to me all you who are weary and bur- 
dened and I will give you rest Take my yoke 
upon you and learn from me for I am gende and 
humble of heart and you will find rest for your 
souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden lighl"- 
Jesus Matthew 11:28-30.

Operation Rescue unfairly 
demon ized, criticized 



Brant 
elley 

'rente t&amp;e- 

Juu 



Would-be detractors of the 
Pro-Life movement 
have drawn attention to 
activities of group* like Operation 
Rescue with quesuons regarding 
their priorities If OR is so con- 
cerned about abortion, why don't 
they do something to prevent il? 

The first answer is They are 
doing something to prevent it," but 
ibe pundits arc looking for a little 
more . . . 

Most OR workers work band- 
m-glove with opponents of sex 
education, free condom distribu- 
tion in schools and child/teen age t 
liberation laws While tbey cham- 
pion the cause of the unborn child. 
their allies are busily working not 
only lo prevent abortions but also 
to prevent the perceived need for 
abortions. 

The problem? Nobody wants to 
view that side of the coin. The very 
people who spout off about doing 
something to prevent abortions arc 
sabotaging efforts lo prevent abor- 
tions. No teenagers would need to 
visit the so-called physician on 
Webster Street on Tuesdays if they 



stayed out of 
the sack with 
each other. 
Pregnancy 
prevention 
would be 
100 percent. 
Not the 85 
percent 
which the 
best of con- 
traceptives 
offer. 

But the 
proponents 
of abortion rights are also propo- 
nents of sex education, condom 
distribution, ad nauseum. ail of 
which simply encourage the cul- 
prit-sexual activity. 

About a month back, the 
television (of all places) 
rather amply demonstrated 
why sex education doesn't 
aid the problem. The 
scene: Home 

impro 
starring 

Allen While 
explaining the 
more impor- 
tant side of 
the facts of 
life to his 
oldest son, 
T i m 
made this 
state- 
ment, 

knew tl 

mechanics of it 

(sex), but I didn't understand 

things like responsibility. . ." 




Abortion is really about responsi- 
bility. Those who push so hard for 
abortion rights seek to absolve 
people in particular, and society in 
general, of responsibility for their 
choices. 

Following free love in Oils soci- 
ety has come the freedom to make 
bad choices and experience their 
results This is not to wave a bony 
forefinger into those who already 
painfully understand this But I get 
just a little defensive toward (hose 
who desire to bill me for the mis- 
takes of others and who label me or 
people who sacrifice their time lo 
organizations like OR as mean- 
spirited and cold-bearted hatemon- 
gers. By the way. why does- 
n't Matthew Chapter 25 
ever receive coverage for 
its efforts? 

Abortion advocates ignore 
the most fundamen- 
tal realities of the 
vbole abortion 
debate: respon- 
sibility, death 
and the slow 
elimination 




of 



this 



nation s 
soul. 
How can 
anyone 
champi- 
on man's 
right to lib- 
erty and the 
pursuit of hap- 
piness if we can't see his way to 
the most fundamental right to life? 



Baseball Gods 'fix' the game. 




The Baseball Gods had good 
seats in Camden Yard on 
Sunday Considering most of 
them were Yankees during their 
playing days, it was no big surprise 
they helped the Yanks capture 
another tide. 

Babe Ruth, Lou Gerhig. Mickey 
Mantle and Casey Stengel used 
tbeir divine influence to affect the 
out come of Sunday's deciding 
playoff between Baltimore and New 
York. 

They divinely righted a wrong 
in baseball when they made a rou- 
tine grounder dribble through the 
legs of Roberto Alomar. 

Alomar's "miscue" {or The 
Gods' command) was poetic justice 
for the sacrilege he committed in 
the church of baseball. His clash 
with an umpire on the last day of the 
season during which be let a loogy 
fly (as everyone knows) into the 
face of one of the "lay clergy" of 
baseball. 

Afier Alomar's impressive dis- 
play of expectoration, be claimed 
the ump couldn't do bis job well 
because be was distraught over the 
death of his son. 

This saddens many who faithful- 



ly sacrifice to 
The Baseball 
Gods. In two 
years, 
Baltimore has 
witnessed two 
of the greatest 
events in base- 
ball history. 
The first being 
future deity Cal 
Ripken when 
he broke Iron 
Man Lou 

Gerhig's con- 
secutive game record. 

One year later, Eddie Murray 
joined other 



future gods 
Hank Aaron 
and Willie 
Mays in the 
4000 hit/400 
dinger club. 

Both 
Murray and 
Ripken gave 
back to base- 
ball a litde of 
what ii lost 
when there 
was no World 
Series two 
years ago. 
Both Murray 
and Ripken 

have a sense ■■- - -■ 

of style and composure that benefits 
the game of baseball. 

In the days of whiny free agents 
and spilbng prima donnas, these 
boys of summer stand, out as men. 
Their hearts are as big as their 
game. They stand for what is right 
about baseball. 

With one act of immaturity,

of Roberto

fan in baseball Alomar is a great 
player He has won six consecutive 
Gold Gloves at second base but his 
gold glove was no match against the 
Louisville Slugger of the gods. 
Alomar is the antithesis of what is 
wrong with baseball today. 

Even though most or the base- 
ball deity are old Yankees, that mat- 
tered little in their choice to make 
Alomar boot the ball. They could 
not let bis one act widen the rift 
between the real world and the 
baseball world. 

The Gods were barsb in their 

judgment, but the punishment 

equaled the crime You spit on an 

ump and you sit on 

— the bench. Not next 

year, but right now. 

No appeal. 

There was justice. 
Not the kind of jus- 
tice you would 
receive in a court of 
law, but the swift 
justice of the 
Baseball Gods on 
Mount Abner 

Doubleday 

All is right in the 

world again. 

Baseball still has a 

lot more to do to 

win its rightful 

place in the bean of 

^= America again, but 

at least baseball won't have the 

specter of Roberto Alomar banging 

over Camden Yards during the 

World Series. The gods can rest 

now and watch the games from tbeir 

perch in left-center field. 

But for the life of me I still can- 
not figure out why the Gods 
screwed up Bill BuckneT in 1986. 
Maybe they hate ex-Cubs. . .

'Frasier's' Butler opens closet door 

Actor, playwright to perform on campus 



by Paul Tupper 
Editor 

Wbai if 1 lold you "Bulldog." 
from NBC's monster hil "Frasier" 
was gay? You wouldn't believe it. 
But would you believe die man 
behind the obnoxiously 
macho character is not only a 
Fort Wayne native • be attend- 
ed Northrop High School - but 
he's openly gay and coming to 
campus? Click your heals, 
Dorothy, because it's true. 

Dan Butler, actor and play- 
wright, will perform his 
Drama Desk Award-nominat- 
ed play, "The Only Thing 
Worse You Could Have Told 
Me,.." for two shows. Oct. 19 
at 8 p m and Oct. 20 at 2:30 
p jn . . at Wd liam s Theatre . Ca! I 
the Williams Theatre bo* 
office for ticket information, 
481-6555. 

The play examines life in 
contemporary gay culture. 
Butler, who wrote the one- 
man, semi-autobiographical 
show, uses over a dozen char- 
acters in 14 vignettes to dis- 
play various sides of gay life. The 
play has offered him many opportu- 
nities, said Butler. 

"It's been this great adventure 
It's lead to this artistic clarity," 



Butler said, who has also acted i 
such movies as "Silence of the 
Lambs." "Rising Sun" and "I Love 
Trouble." 

Builer's characters in "Only 
Thing" include an AIDS volunteer 
from Tennessee who delivers food 



the play are directly taken from his 
life experiences, Butler isn't willing 
lo say which pans. "It adds to the 
mystery," he said. 

Being openly gay did not always 
appeal to Butler. 

"I always knew I was attracted to 
men, but 1 had a high 
school girlfriend." Butler 
said, describing his com- 
ing-out process. "Gays in 
films were always eccen- 
tric. It wasn't until I saw 
"Boys in the Band" at PIT 
{Purdue-Indiana Theatre) 
that I began to think I 
might be different " 

Butler, who has 
been in a committed rela- 
tionship for over two-and- 
a-half years, describes 
being gay in the Midwest 
as being "based on shame " 
"Everyone has 
their own journey for com- 
ing out. It takes exception- 
al courage to come out," 
said Butler, who first told 
bis sister he was gay before 
coming out to his entire 
Courtesy ol Shooting Star Photo Agency" family in 19T7. 
to an AIDS patient and falls in love, Performing "Only Thing" in Fort 

and a beer-guzzling heterosexual Wayne is exciting and experimental 
confronted with his best friends for the actor, "It's home," Butler 
homosexuality said. "I'm interested to see what the 

Although he admits that parts of reaction will be." 




Many may think portraying a 
character like "Bulldog." a seeming- 
ly homophobic spons commentator 
for the same station that employs the 
lead character, played by Emmy 
winner Kelsey Granuncr, would be 
some kind of vindication for a gay 
actor. But according to Butler. 
"Bulldog" shouldn't be siereotyped 
in that manner. 

"It's noi vindication. It's a sepa- 
rate issue," be said. "1 think Bulldog 



is bright. He wouldn't hurt anyone 
Bui you wouldn't want him at a 
party because be sometimes insults 
the world. I love playing him ." 

Bulla says he's received support 
from both the cast of "Frasier" and 
from his famtiy, all of whom have 
seen the play. 

Fans can expeci lo see more of 
Butier and "Bulldog": Buder has 
signed lo make appearances in half 
of this season's 22 "Frasier" 



episodes 

Even though Butler's character 
isn't gay, be has been paying atten- 
tion lo "Ellen," which is threatening 
to make the lead character, played 
by Ellen DeGeneres, an openly gay 
woman. Buder said making a famil- 
iar character gay is the proper way 
for a show to tackle gay issues. 

"I think it's the best way lo intro- 
duce a gay lead character." said 
Buder. "if it's wrilten well"

Roommates, soon to be stalemates 



by Jeremy Ecenturger 
News Editor 

I thought I bad survived the days 
of fighting with the people 1 lived 
with. First it was my parents who 
seemed to think I was never old 
enough lo do anything Then there 
were the days of fighting with my 
brothers and sisters over which tele- 
vision programs would be watched 
on any particular nighl. Little did 1 
know, the worst was yet to come .1 
got a roommate. 

Like any poor college student, 1 
was forced to get a roommate when 
the cost of living on my own became 
too high I though! it would be great 
I would have someone lo talk to. 
split the rent with, divide the cosl of 
the food and utilities with, .or so I 
thought. It turns out that it may be an 
experience I will never forget - no 
matter how hard 1 may try to. 

Having a roommate is difficult 
You have to share a bathroom, the 
bills, ihe food, and, most important- 
ly, ihe responsibilities And lei's not 
forget how hard u is to find a person 
that you can stand to see on a daily 
basis, witboul wanting to cause 
harm to them. 

The bathroom is an adventure in 
and of itself- For instance, who gets 
to put their toothpaste in the medi- 
cine cabinet? Whose wet towels go 
where? Does the toilet seat slay up 
or down? Who cleans all ihe scum 
off of the toilet, tub and sink? These 
are jusi a few questions thai roam 
through my head everyday. 

You know it's bad when you wake 
up in ihe morning, go lo run some 
water on your face, and discover a 
towel full of vomil in the sink — a 
result of your roommate's partying 
from the night before Yes, one must 
always expect ihe unexpected when 
living with a roommate. 

Fighting for ihe last of the food is 
cause for a fist fight How do you 
decide who gets the last of the chips 
sitting in the pantry? Or Ihe last 
Pepsi in ihe refrigerator? Who does 
the dishes after dinner is through? 

It gets really frustrating when 
your roommate is twice ihe size of 
you and therefore eais twice as 
much. What's worse is that after 
they eat every piece of food in sight, 
they leave grease all over the oven, a 
counter full of dishes, and never 
seem to notice if ihey happcrcd to 
drop a few panicles on ihe floor. 

Yet the most difficult Ihing to 
handle is the bills. Who pays the 
phone bill when go one admits to 
calling long distance? Who pays the 
electric bill when one aims the air 
conditioner on all day? When do 
you pay ihe bills? For me, il is real- 
ly annoying when you have lo con- 



slantly bug your roommale for ihe 
money Plus, you may spend money 
on a subscription to a newspaper, 
and the olhcr may line the litter box 
with il before your eyes ever get lo 
see it 

So to prevent these awful events 
from happening with you and your 
roommale, I offer these 10 simple 
tips of advice, 

1. Before he/she moves in, make 
sure you do not have conflicting 
schedules. Nothing is worse than 
when one person is going to school 
and working the morning shift and 
the other is partying in ihe apanmeni 
all night and working second shift 
Set time limits. 

2. Roommates should always be 
honest with each other If something 
is bothering you about your room- 
male, tell him/her. Telling the person 
blundy is the easiest way to handle 
every situation 

3. A cleaning schedule should be 
made. It is not fair when one person, 
usually the cleanlier one. cleans the 
entire apartment every night 

4. Roommalcs should never get 
involved with the other's personal 
life and relationships 

5. Two people living together 
should almost always have separate 
friends Seeing the same person day 
in and day out can really be sicken- 
ing. Roommates should be encour- 
aged lo spend time away from each 
other. Unless of course you're mar- 
ried to your roommate. 

6. Organize Make a list of who 
pays for wbat No one person should 



pay for all the groceries, pay the 
entire phone bill when both use such 
things You should always try lo 
split things right down the middle. 

7. Roommates should know if a 
key to the apartment has been given 
to a third party. The third person 
always seems lo take advantage of 
the facilities available (o them. 
Nobody wants to pay their S50 
worth of long-distance calls 

8. If you're very smart, you will 
always put a padlock on your bed- 
room door The trick behind the pro- 
cedure is for you to keep the only 
key lo that lock. If you gel to the 
point where you just cannot take it 
anymore, simply turn that lock. 

9. One should always learn to 
hide things. For instance, one night 
your roommate may offer to buy 
you dinner, but you later realize 
he/she used the money you bad set 
aside for laundry. 

10. The rule thai beats all others is 
io simply think twice before you do 
anything. While you may think the 
hardest pan was getting him/her to 
move in in the first place. It is virtu- 
ally impossible io gel the person to 
leave. Have you ever seen "Single 
While Female"? 

Though these tips are just the "tip 
of the iceberg." 1 hope they help you 
in achieving some son of compro- 
mise wilh the ones you live with.

Journey to Diversity 



A personal look at adoption 



by Paul Tuppcr 
Editor 

Good news, friends I bave 
found some people who arc will- 
ing lo discuss diversity from their 
perspectives in the coming weeks 
As they craft the words into 
award-winning articles. I wanted 
lo share an experience I've had as 
an adopted person, 

This came about in one of my 
classes. "Controversy in America." 
Tbis is an excellent class I recom- 
mend to anyone and everyone. 
especially those with strong, well- 
informed opinions (how I got there 
still remains a great mystery). 

We were discussing abortion, a 
topic that increasingly raises blood 
pressures in every part of this 
country My well-educated class- 
mates, as with the enure country, 
are divided on the moral issues 
surrounding this debate Many of 
the arguments focused on the 
often-used abortion answer adop- 
tion. And though I agree adoption 
is a possible solution for some, I 
can't say it works for everyone 
Especially the adopted. 

1 discovered in this conversa- 
tion that many people believe that 
adoption is a cut and dry routine. 
That adopting a baby is as easy as 
filling a request form, being 
reviewed by a panel of presumably 
well-adjusted judges and instantly 
being handed a baby. The family 
then drives away and lives happily 
ever after 1 wish it were that easy. 

My adoption is not a rariry, 
with the exception that I was not 
adopted at birth, but much later. I 
was adopted on Christmas Eve, 
1974, shortly before my parents 
had a cli ild of their own 1 grew up 
experiencing the growing pains of 
every child in America, but with 
one difference. I always felt like 



MYSTEBY J&gt;ItftfEJ8 OFFERS 

ALTERNATIVE ENTERTAINMENT 



the goldfish to my brother's puppy 
In my eyes, I was second best and 
loved least. 1 was well taken care 
of. but not fully appreciated 1 
equate my life to cookies: Which 
would you rather bave. a store 
bought cookie or one you home 
baked? 

Toe worst feeling I've ever had 
in my life was when my brother 
deservingly won bis little league's 
MVP award. My dad wanted to 
display the massive trophy in the 
most prominent place in ihe house 
Yet none of the awards I had ever 
won had been up for such consid- 
eration I don't remember ever 
feeling less loved. 

Although 1 can say with clarity 
that this does happen in many 
homes, I'm proud to say not every 
adopted child experiences this. I 
have good friends who arc the par- 
ents of both adopted and biological 
children, and they do exceptional 
jobs of showering both children 
with love and attention But 1 reit- 
erate, this scenario is not common. 
Adopted children placed in homes 
do feel left out and grow up bitter 
This creates problems no one will 
mention and few hash out. By all 
means, there is more to question 
for (he adopted than wbo is one's 
natural parents 

I'm lucky, I was able to hear 
my parents admit ihis to me when 
I was 19 and began to understand 
why such a thing could ever bap- 
pen From that moment on. we 
were able to begin a long and' 
tedious healing process that I am 
proud to say is nearly complete- 
But die reality of the situation is 
tbis: not all adoptions have story- 
book endings. Perhaps those wbo 
argue against abortion should take 
thai into consideration before 
using adoption as a basis for their 
arguments.

Staff Writer 

How many times have you gone 
to a play and wished you could get 
involved and be a part of the action? 
Bower-North Productions of Fort 
Wayne specializes in doing just that 
with iheir mystery dinner plays. 
Their latest production, "Who Slew 
Shazoo?' promises to be an enter- 
taining evening. 

The mystery dinner offers a real 
"Who done it" mystery play along 
with an elaborate meal. The Oct. 22 
play of "Who Slew ShazooT' will 
lake place at the Holiday Inn 
Northwest at 6 p.m. Don't worry 
about having to grab a bite to eat 
before you arrive because a meal of 
Lobster Bisque, sirloin, potatoes and 
chocolate mousse will be served. 

The play is written and directed by 
Alan North, who became involved in 
ihis business on somewhat of a 
whim, North explained that he and 
co-owner of Bower-North 
Productions, Larry Bower, were in a 
murder mystery play together aboul 
8 and-a-half years ago, and when it 
was over be told Bower, "I think I 
can write one of these!" And that is 
just what he and Bower did. 

Bower and North (hen formed 
Bower-North Productions and their 
first mystery dinner look place on 
April 15. 1988. Since then, they've 
done about eight different produc- 
tions, including over sixty perfor- 
mances a year. 

Perhaps the most unique aspect of 
a mystery dinner show is the audi- 
ence participation. In fact. North said 
that the most rewarding part of pro- 
ducing these plays is the thrill of the 
audiences' response, as they let their 
imagination run wild and enjoy 
the evening. 

Throughout the dinner, the "sus- 
pects" - in full character and costume 
- circulate through the audience and 
talk (o the audience members about 
the relationships each had with 



the victim. 

Of course ihe play wouldn't be 
complete without a detective. The 
detective travels throughout the 
audience, trying to do what everyone 
else at the mystery dinner is trying to 
do — figure out who the killer is. 
According to North, the detective is 
"...not as smart as the rest of 
the audience." 

These mystery dinners not only 
give you the opportunity to be a pan 
of the production, but also allow you 
(o play detective for the evening. 

The latest show. "Wbo Slew 
Shazoo?," features a receptionist and 
three fortune tellers, each of whom 



has a motive to murder Shazoo. If 
you can figure out who did the deed, 
you get to carry the prestigious bde 
of "Super Sleuth of the Evening." a 
name which lets everyone know that 
you have figured ii all out. 

Additionally. IPFW has a connec- 
tion lo ibis particular play. John 
Knight, an associate professor of 
consumer and family sciences, along 
with some of his students, arc over- 
seeing this production as pan of their 
course requirements. 

According to North, the purpose 
of getting the students involved is 
giving these students hands-on expe- 
rience in running a production from 



sian to finish. North compared it to a 
psychology student having a chance 
to work with actual patients prior to 
starting their professional career II 
offers a chance for students to sec 
what managerial skills they need and 
possess in an entertainment selling 
while still in school. 

So, if you're interested in having a 
great night out, consider attending 
"Who Slew Shazoo?" Be ready to 
bring your imagination and to enjoy 
a play in a way that you probably 
never bave before, 

Tickets are S25 per person (includ- 
ing food) and can be purchased by 
contacting John Knight at 481-6562.

match in a single pro set, 8-6. Hasler 
and English won the No. 2 doubles, 
7-5. 6-2. 

"It was mat match that I saw a lot 
of things we had been working on 
all season come together," Horton 
said. 

IPFW continued from there. 
Their next meet, a home contest 
against Goshen College, showed the 



Mastodons leading the way before 
prevailing rain overtook the players 
and the meet was canceled. 

On the high note. IPFW entered 
the Great Lakes Valley Conference 
tournament as Horton had planned: 
improving and educated about their 
opponents. 

Seeded seventh oul of eight 
teams after their recent perfor- 
mances, the Mastodons scared sec- 
ond-seeded St. Joe College with 
three singles wins before succumb- 
ing to the Pumas' pressure. 5-3. The 
Pumas won the regular-season meet 
between the two teams, 9-0. 

IPFW then look on Southern 
Illinois University-Edwardsville, 
another team which swept the 
Mastodons. 5-0 Wuh the meet 
between the two teams Ued at 4-4, 
Baumgartner won the last match 3- 



6, 6- 1 , 6- 1 , to scat the upset. 

'That was just unbelievably 
huge," Horton said. 

The GLVC tournament's and the 
season's final meet ended with 
IPFW losing to Lewis University, 5- 
4. 

"My concern was, 'Can we get 
after it mentally,'" Horton said, 
despite bis confidence in his team's 
physical abibties. 

"[And) we came oul sluggish." 

Even then, taking four singles 
matches from the Flyers was cause 
for encouragement. The Mastodons 
finished sixth out of the tourna- 
ment's eight-team field, one place 
higher than their seeding 

"This year's team finished the 
same place as last year's team," 
Horton said, "and I mink lasl year's 
team had more talent." 



Soccer players struggle 



by S. Brant Kelley 
Sports Editor 

After streaking to a 3-1 Great 
Lakes Valley Conference record, 
Terry Stefankiewicz' soccer team 
has fallen into a mid-season funk, 
losing four straight matches in the 
last two weeks. Now al 5-8. 
Stefankiewicz is forced to rebuild 
bis team's morale and vision, fast. 

Just a week after winning their 
third straight match, the Mastodons 
travelled lo first-place Lewis 
University and lost a defensive con- 
test, 1-0, on an early second-half 
goal Twelve minutes into the sec- 
ond half, a Flyer shot rang from the 
comer of the field and bounced 
twice before the Flyers' Tom Zee 
drove home the second chance. 



Despite the goal, Stefankiewicz 
described the second half as one of 
the Mastodons' better halves of soc- 

"We played die best 45 minutes 
of soccer we ever played," 
Stefankiewicz said. "They [Lewis] 
only got the ball past midfield three 
times." 

The Flyers' rise to the lop has 
been borne by their defense, which 
has kept opponents scoreless for 
eight straight matches.' But 
Stefankiewicz said his team missed 
some chances and he minks they arc 
not the GLVC's best eleven. 

"1 think they're beatable," he 
said The next night, he would get a 
chance to test his theory against the 
team he thinks is better: the 
University of Wisconsin-Park side. 



They're in second place." 
Stefankiewicz said, "but I think 
they're the best team in the confer- 
ence." 

IPFW began the match by con- 
tinuing the excellent offensive play 
from the previous afternoon and 
matching UWP's level of play with 
over a dozen straight passes on a 
first possession which had the 
Rangers' defense scurrying. 

But with the table set for anoth- 
er good afternoon, the Mastodons 
yanked the tablecloth from under- 
neath and trashed the place settings 
themselves. 

"Then all the wheels came off 
the wagon," Stefankiewicz said. 
"They just didn't play well, that's 
all"

Volleydons continue to spike 
their way to tournament reality 



by S. Brant Kcllcy 
Sports Editor 

The IPFW women's volleyball 
leam continued lo romp Ihrougb its 
schedule will] six more wins over 
the last two weeks 10 increase its 
winning streak to 15 wins, tying a 
school record. 

En route to their present 18-4 
record, 9-0 against (he Great Lakes 
Valley Conference, the Volleydons 
lost only their fourth and fifth 
games in the last 15 matches, and 
that on the final of three matches in 
three nights 

Oct. 4, Si. Joe College's young 
squad walked inlo the Gates Center 
with hopes and went out with a 
three-straighl defeat, 15-9, 15-3, 15- 
8. 

"They were ... very young, and 
they played that way." IPFW coach 
Tun Heffron said "They know 
they're going lo take some lumps." 



According lo Heffron, SJC's 
freshman and sop bom ore -la den 
squad has a bright future Puma 
coach Kevin Furnish agreed 

"We were looking lo gelling 
some lurk victories oul of Ihis." 
Furnish said "I thought we bad nice 
communication on the court." 

"|Bui] they aitack il at such a 
high point above the net thai ,., 
we're already at a disadvantage " 

SJC was only the first team at a 
disadvantage; Hillsdale College was 
the next. 

After giving up the first seven 
points to Hillsdale, IPFW rebound- 
ed lo win the first game. 15-8, and 
subsequently the match, 15-4, 15-9. 

"Traditionally, we play very well 
against them," Heffron said. "After 
that point [7-0], we just kind of con- 
trolled the match." 

Wayne Slate, for the second time 
this year, followed al Hillsdale, 15- 
2. 15-13,8-15, 15-7. 




"li started oul ... we played real- 
ly well." Heffron said. "[But] for 
some reason, we just don't play well 
against them " 

Nevertheless, the win was the 
Volleydons' seventh against a Great 
Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference foe, which is important 
lo iheir tournament hopes 

The Volleydons' nexl three 
games were each one night apart 
and greatly enhanced their position 
in Ihe GLVC. 

Lewis University came to the 
Gales Center on Oct. 9 and their 
advancemeni in the conference was 
barred in three straight, 15-7, 15-7, 
15-6. 

As usual, IPFW's athleticism 
look over for the match, especially 
that of an increasingly prominent 
Dottie Porch. 

"Again, Dottie jusl dominated," 
Heffron said "When Dottie jusl 
goes up over iheir block, slams it 
down ... they [Lewis] just kind of 
looked al each other like. 'How are 
we gonna stop that?'" 

In each game, Ihe VoIleyDons 
jumped to a lead of at least four 
points before cruising lo the end of 
the game 

IPFW traveled to Ihe University 
of Indianapolis the next night and 
won a gutsy match in three. 

While a quick match, the play 
was closer than the score indicated. 
That was hardly a surprise to the 
Volleydons. who traditionally face a 
scrappy Ul team Bui ultimately. Ihe 
'Dons' athleticism won the day 

"We're jusl too much for them 
athletically and in serving and in the 
middle," Heffron said. 

In their last match of (he week- 
end, Heffron's Dons displayed the 
fatigue of a squad in its third match. 
Southern Illinois University- 
Edwardsville, then tied with IPFW 
for the GLVC Blue Division lead, 
pushed the 'Dons in each of the 
three games before IPFW ended ihe 
maich, 15-10. 15-7, 15-9 

They wdl enter ihe University of 
Tampa tournament in Florida with a 
9-0 GLVC mark and a tie for fourth 
in Ihe Midwesl regional rankings. 

"We were jusl mentally and 
physically drained," Heffron said. 
"We didn't play well." 



Andi Reichart goes for the spike. 



SOCCER, continued from page 7 

Despite uninspired play follow- 
ing the initial offensive sequence, 
ihe Mastodons entered halftime tied 
with the Rangers, 0-0. 

Early in the second half, UWP 
scored, then Justin Labrum evened 
the match at 1-1. Then the Rangers 
scored twice more without an 
answer and seni IPFW to its second 
straight loss and the downside of 
500 for the first lime in a month. 

The sky looked even more gray 
afier last weekend and two overtime 
losses by the Mastodons to middle- 
of-the-pack GLVC teams. 

Southern Illinois University- 
Edwardsville marched onto IPFW's 
field and left lied with the 
Mastodons, 1-1, al ihe end of regu- 
lation, thanks io a lasi-minute goal 
by Mastodon Brandon Combe. 
Labrum irapped and crossed a bard 
pass from goalkeeper Mike Schmitz 
to Combe, who then kicked the ball 
home. 

But SU1-E jumped on Ihe 'Dons 
in overtime, scoring their second 
goal just six minutes into ihe period. 
GLVC scoring champion Danen 
Snyder of SIU-E scored again in the 
overtime for the final score, 3-1 

"I don't think they're a better 
team than we are," Slefankiewicz 
said, mystified by the loss. "[And] 
we went lo the ball better on 
Saturday than we did on Sunday" 

Sunday capped the streak of bad 
luck for ihe 'Dons as they dropped 
their fourth-straight conference 
match, to a previously winless 
University of Southern Indiana learn 
in the GLVC, and losi several spots 
in the conference standings. 

The Mastodons started the match 



on fire, pulling ahead 3-1 in ihe first 
half. But they leaned back on their 
heels and losi in overtime, 4-3. 

Schmitz lost the handle on the 
ball on USI's first goal as it bounced 
ofl his chest lo a waiting Eagle 
attacker who scored on ihe pui- 
back. USI's second goal came off an 
IPFW defender. Schmitz called for 
the ball and confusion set in 



between himself and the defender 
before the defender decided to clear 
Ihe ball from the penalty area, 
shanking it into the goal instead. 

In overtime, the Eagles' Glen 
Doran, scored the winning goal. 

Coach Mark Coffee said another 
win should secure a bid, but Iwo

Harriers near season's 
end with consistency 



by S. Brant Kcllcy 
Sports Editor 

The IPFW cross counlry learns 
ran through ihe stretch parts of iheir 
seasons over ihe lasl two weeks, 
first at the Goshen College 
Invitational on Oct. 5 and then al 
IPFW's Open Meet last weekend. 

The women's team finished fifth 
out of seven teams at Goshen, in 
front of Tri-Staic University and St. 
Francis College. 

Kay Pulver finished third in the 
race with a lime of 20 minutes, 27 
seconds, but the next Mastodon run- 
ner was Melanie Vamer, at 16lh. 

Mona Mourad finished 43rd 
with a 23:48 time. Cindy Duba, 
Kristine Minnick and Andrea 
Harding finished 50th, 52nd and 
53rd, respectively 

At the Open, Pulver won her first 
race of the year with only her sec- 
ond sub-20 minute time of the sea- 
son, 19:55. Vamer and Roser fin- 
ished third and fourth, respectively, 
in the event, which did not tally 
team totals. 

"Madeline Roser did an excel- 
lent race for herself," Tillapaugb 
said. 

The men's team continued lo 
display more consistency as they 
finished fourth of five teams, in 
front of Goshen, at the Goshen 
Invitational and placed three run- 
ners in ihe first five spots al the 
IPFW Open meet 

Freshman Steve Teuscb finished 
third in both races and Chad 
Clevinger and Adam Barton fin- 
ished close behind as the men's 
team displayed a consistency lack- 



ing from earlier meets They could 
be even better if Randy Hawkins 
regains his health before season's 
end. Hawkins has balded calf prob- 
lems for most of Ihe season 

"Definitely ... we're making pos- 
itive strides as we go from race to 



race," Tillapaugh said. 

This weekend, the Mastodons 
travel to Bloomington where they 
participate in ihe Big State/Little 
State meet, which was originally to 
be hosied by Indiana State 
University in Terre Haute. 




Adam Barton makes strides toward the finish line.
