Campus alcohol use or abuse? 

The facts about college students' drinking habits 



1/ your conccplion of Ihc 
drinking hjbits ol college students 
is basca on what you've sec on TV 
and in the movies, or what you 
hear aboul in the media, you prob- 
ably think Ilia I everyone on cam- 
pus is usually wandering around in 
an alcoholic haze. 

Sludenls, as well as the gener- 
al public, have been led to tielicve 
thai alcohol abuse is ramp.int on 
college campuses. In a 2002 survey 
ol UOO college students conduct ed 
by "The Peer Edilor," alcohol abuse 
was listed as Ihc second biggest 
problem on campus, (railing 
behind cost of education. 

However, recent studies have 
shown that this belief is not true. In 
fad, according to a 2000 Core 
Institulc study, 69 percent of col- 
lege students have 0-5 drinks per 
week. Tlie number of non-drinkers 
has actually increased from 1 5 to 19 
percent over the last 10 years. 

Some other little known facts 

* 68 percent ol sludi 



* 77 percent reported that Ihcy 
have not pcrlormcd poorly on a 
test or project because of alcohol or 
drug abuse. 

• 98.5 percent of college stu- 
dents have not been arrested for a 
DUl/DWI. 

■ 73 percent ol college stu- 
dents use a designated driver ivhcn 



Ihcy dnnk. 

Certain, individuals are also 
more likely to overindulge Ihan 
others- Slalistically, drinking rates 
arc highest in fraternities and 
sororities, followed by on-campus 
housing. Additionally, freshmen 
and those involvedAvith athletics 
lend to drink more. Those who 
drink least are students who live 
with their Families and commute. 

Even though most college stu- 
dents do not abuse alcohol, there 
are still many who do and Ihe con- 
e. "larger 



and r 



: destru 



; than 



nonly thought," according to a 
study conducted by the National 
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism. 

The NIAAA study found that 
among college students 18 to 24 
years of age, drinking conlributes 
lo an estimated 1.400 deaths. 
500.000 injuries and 70.r 



not regularly engage 
drinking, many have or do on cxca- 
sion. Binge drinking is defined as 
drinking five or more drinks in a 
row for men and four or more for 
women. Of the sludenls surveyed, 
about 30 percent had parlicipalcd 
in binge drinking more Ihan three 
limes in a two week period. 

The NIAAA Task Force report- 
ed thai this group of frequent binge 
drinkers accounts for almost 70 

Eercent of all alcohol consumption 
y college sludenls. This means 
that a small percentage of college 



students are causing most of the 
alcohol- related problems and giv- 
ing Ihe majority of responsible col- 
lege students a bad reputation. 

For those students who do 
indulge, or overindulge, this 
behavior can have a suDslanlial 
impacl on their academic perform- 
ance. A direct relalionship nas been 
shown between the number of 
drinks Ihatasludent has and his GPA. 

■ "D" and "F" students aver- 
age 95 drinks per week. 

* "C" students average 5.G 
drinks per week. 

* "B" students average 4.4 
drinks per week, 

* "A" students average 3,1 
drinks per week. 

Obviously, excessive drinking 
can also cause a variety of substan- 
tial health problems including 
damage to the heart, brain and 
liver. The greatest health risk for 
college drinkers, however, is Ihe 
increased incidence of accidents, 
both vehicular and otherH'ise. 

All this adds up to Ihe com- 
mon sense notion that if you are 
going lo drink, it is essential to be 
responsible and do so only in 
moderation.

Voluntary life without TV: Part 2 
One writer tells his story 



The IhJtd 
lU was my Xa&amp;X. I wnlrhi^d more 
TV and didn't gel down to the 
library very often, nor did I go 
to the 3rl hou.se theater a; 
inueh. By then I had a car wilh 
me and had discovered Ihe 
enormous amounts ol picluf' 
eaque locations off campus. 
Bloominglon and Monioe and 
Brown Counlies olfer a huge

the parks around Monroe 
County are the subject for 



res! of the summer hermetically 
attached to the huge TV my 
friends and I had in our apart- 
ment watching Sopranos 
reruns- 1 also discovered "OZ," 
of which 1 also became an 
instant fan. Later I became 
enamored with shows on the 
Discovery, History and AJcE 
channels. At that lime, I seemed 
to have fo

■" — has remained 



I'm not sure what the 
result of this new TV-less peri- 
od of my life will be. I imagine 
I will eventually subscribe to 
cable again when I have 
enough dough lined up for it. 
Maybe by this winter i will have 
basic cable aivj possibly HBO. 

For now, I have to be con- 






fide.) 



ifter my third 
lU. I came home to Fort Wayne 
and enrolled at IPFW. I got 
heavily mvolved m the student 
newspaper, which seemed lobe 
my calling. My life became dif- 
ferent from my tile at lU. IVhile 
1 lived at home thai first semes- 
ter back from college, t had a 
TV at my parents' house, which 
1 watched, but not as much as 
when 1 had been m high school. 
It seemed 1 spent most of my 
spare lime away from the 
house wilh the friends 1 slill 
had in Fort Wayne. 

When my friends and I 
moved into an apartment dur- 
ing the summer alter I moved 
home, 1 discovered Ihe Home 
Box Office channel. 1 had previ- 
ously watched an episode of 
"The Sopranos" during a cross 
country drive wilh my father 
thai spring. Being 50 percent 
Italian (and of the school of 
Ihoughl that the mafia is still 
glamorous). I was immediately 
hooked. 

1 proceeded to spend the 



in place from that t 
still a huge "Sopranos" and 
"OZ" fan. Tjust no longer have 
cable. My situation again has 
changed. No longer livmg with 
friends, I don't have the luxury 
of cable. Granted, I have a cable 
modem, which I've decided is 
as necessary for me as coffee is 
for many other people. I have 
not watched cable or any TV 

In not gelling cable serv- 
ice, 1 also seem to mysteriously 
not have Ihe local free channels. 
1 think it must Ije my incompe- 

, though, m not being able 

channels. 
Not thai it mall 
I interested in anything o 



I fare on PBS. So, 1 
am once again completely TV- 
less. 1 turn on the TV and all 
that 1 see arc ant races. 

My TV is also a little 
embarrassing to me since it is 
enormously small. I'm not even 
sure what Ine picture size is; the 
set was only 599. It was Ihe sec- 
ond smallest set Best Buy 
offered. The other siie was Ihe 
one people tike to keep in Iheir 



, earlier than I used to. I 
would guess that the free time 1 
do have will be spent attempt- 
ing to finish up mv English 
degree, 1 wilt probably also do 
plenty of reading and maybe 
even find myself trying my 
hand at creative writing — that

T beneficial for 



sion should be enperienccd in 
moderation. I think that a per- 
son — especially one with an 
impressionable mind as most 
young people have — certainly 
needs lots and lots of time 
away fram TV. 

On the same token, TV has 
its merits. There are certainly 

and educational programs 
broadcast today. It's just a mat- 
ter of balancing one's viewing 
time with time one should be 
partaking in other pursuits.

Driver's Ed 101 

Today's Lesson: How to park, properly 



Allow me to provide a sce- 
&gt;: It's 8:30 a.m. Tuesday 
ling. After battling Ihe road 
ruction crew outside of my 
addition, "racine" with the older 
drivers taking their day Irips to 
Walgreens, navigating more 
road construction and those peo- 
ple ivho refuse to drive over 40 
mph on Stellhom Road, it's now 
my turn to batlle fellow IPFW 
students for a parking spot. 

I knoiv what you re think- 
ing — this is going to be another 
Eerson complaining about the 
LCk of parking on campus. Well, 
you're wrong. So, allow me to 
finish my scenario. 

I pull into the parking 
garage. I am wailing patiently as 
the soul train of cars sloivly 
moves along in an endless search 
for a parking space. 

Finally, I'm the leader ol the 
line. I spot a nice parking space 
between a fairly small vehicle 
and a van. I'm thinking there has 
got to be more than enough 
room for my little car to fit. I start 
to pull in and what do find? 
Some jacko didn'l quite realise 



white lines. Needless to say, I 
have to back out and move up to 
the third level of the garage in 
search tor a new place to house 
my car for a few hours. 

Yes, I think wc have a lack 
of parking on this campus; but 
I'm sure it doesn't help that the 
people who do drive to this cam- 
pus can't park their cars. I realize 
that it has been a while since 
some students have had Driver's 
Ed, but I'm sure it's staled in the 
driver's manual thai when park- 
ing, one should park between 
the two parallel white lines. 

In some cases, the parking 
spaces arc marked off wilh tivo 
white parallel lines, a very large, 
open space and then another set 
jH white parallel lines. I've 
noticed these parking spaces 
tend to cause the most contusion 
for drivers on campus. The fool 
and a half space is not to be 
parked over. This is a "no tire" 
area. This area is generally used 
for passengers to open their car 
doors to exit or enter the car. 

A few nights ago, I was in 
the office working on my stories. 
When I arrived in the parking 
garage. I found that some very 
nice driver parked so close to me 
that 1 couldn't even open my car 
door. Consequently. 1 had to get 
in through my passenger side 
door and climb over lo the dri- 




didn'l 
that I 

need to be backing out ol the 
space. So. in order for me to 
leave the garage. 1 had to back 
oul very slowly, in the opposite 
direction of the flow ol traffic. A 
little hard to understand? Picture 
it as though you were backing 
into a one way street the wrong 

Parking isn't really difficult. 
It's just something thai takes 
practice. Therefore, maybe some 
Sunday, these people who can't 
seem lo park betiveen Ihe white 

Dad lo learn how lo park. 

On a more serious note, it's 
an issue of a lack of courtesy. It's 
rude lo park someone in, which 
is essentially what these people 
arc doing. It's rude to run some- 
one over wilh your rolling 
"bookbag" and it's r\ide to let 
the door slam in someone's face. 

What happened to being 
nice? 1 try to be as nice as I can, 
but if this is the way people are 
going lo act on campus, then 
maybe we should [ust go back lo 
being neanderthals, carrying 
around clubs and beating these 
cars that parkover the while lines. 



Now 1 would like lo provide 
few parking tips to people o 
campus. 



should even make a scpar 
parking lot for the students with 
vans and SUVs, I really don't 
have anything against Ihe people 
that these vehicles, it's just that 
feci that they think 



Students shouldn't be 
afraid to use the inside circle of 
the round-a-boul. It is there lo 
help the flow of traffic. All we 
need is a few good people lo 
show others how it works. 

Since a vast majority of peo- 
ple on campus fear the inside cir- 
cle, when someone docs choose 
to dive in the truide circle, that 
person never has a chance lo 
mer^c because everyone else is 
driving on the outside. 

•I'm all about driving a lit- 
tic over Ihe speed limit, but driv- 
ing fast in Ihe parking garage 
isn't a good idea. I can't tell you 
how many limes I have almost 
been hit. 

I've seen my life flash 
before my eyes, but then luckily, 
the person driving slams on his 
breaks and avoids hitting me. If 
people drive a bit mon: slowly, 
not only will you avoid hitting 
me or other students, but your 
brakes will thank you. 

• I realize that a collision 
occurs when tivo cars go lor the 
same pedestrian, but drivers, 
please do realize that the cross- 
..Willks arc meant for pedestrian 
- crossing. 

In other words, when you 
sec Ihe crosswalk, that doesn't 
mean you should play "chicken" 
with whomever is trying to cross 
the street. I don't care how late 
you arc going to be for class. 
pedestrians always have the 
right of (vay. 



Venus Asks, Mars Answers: Man-s obsession with football, is it just primal urge? 



Venus Asks: 

The football fetish, known 
lo females as Sunday, has got to 
be one of the biggest hurdles in 
every relationship. The fact that 
my guy could resist every urge, 
mcluding bathroom breaks, 
food, and well, you know... in 
order to see the score of a certain 
football game is highly annoy- 
ing. What is it that catches his 
eye and makes him oblivious lo 
the world around him? 

This year is worse than Ihe 
last few. My guy has become 
interested and highly mvolved 
in fantasy football, an Intemet 
"game" among many different 
"teams" batthng il oul for ttie 
most points (if 1 understand cor- 
rectly). These poinLs arc earned 



by Ihe number of yards run. 
thrown, etc. by certain football 
players that each human player 
drafted earlier last month. Docs 
my man win anything for this? 
Thai's what I'm interested in' 

I guess the most problemat- 
ic thing aboul this freakish fool- 
ball obsession is the fad that it 
culsintoour quality lime togeth- 
er. No. wait — let me finish (you 
men were about lo tackle me for 
that comment. I could feel it). It's 
not that 1 wont your hill atten- 
tion on Sunday, just please 
acknowledge that I exist for 
more reasons than lo run food 
out to you and bring you refills 
and such. My girlfriend job 
description says nothmg about 
waitrcssmg. If you want that, go 



I'm not even asking to be 
included in your Sunday obses- 
sion; 1 tried that anti found 



is that you get your own food 
and drinks or ask politely and 
stop assuming that I'll be there 
every Sunday to wait on you. I 
have a life too, you know! 



Howi 



s that a 



become 

obsessed with something just for 
myself, your priorities overtake 
mine unless what I want lo do 
for myself is during your Stmday 
event. Watch out buddy, things 
just may be changing! 

Nick: When I was in a relation- 
ship in high school. I told the girl 
I was dating that Sundays were 
off limits because of football I 
really don't know what the 



appeal of football is 



Michelle: Man's obsession with 
football goes back to ancient 
limes. It's symbolic of war and 
the strategic planning that is 
involved. 

Kathy: It's just holding them 
over 'tile hockey season really 

Renee: Men kind of unite when 
they are walching football. Ifs 
kind like when women are 
walching Oprah; we all feel a 
sense of togetherness and com- 
mon ground. 

Jonah: We live in a society 
where we feel like we have to 
prove our masculinity, so, foot- 
ball IS an outlet for miwrulinity.

The Independents fire it up at Sneaky Pete's 



One adv^inlagc ai knowing

lt:m is Ihar more oflcn (ban nol. 
Ihe band has io sneak you into 
the venue as such was my case 
Friday, Ocl. 18 when local acis 
Fisted Sister, Fal Ass and 
Lurking Corpses welcomed 
louring band the Independents 
to Sneaky Pete's. 

Upon arriving at Sneaky 
Pete's. I had to make cortlaci 
with my friends in the sloppy 
punk bind Fislcd SIslcr. Luckily, 
guitarist Dylan Gram sent drum- 
mer Shem Hinkle to wait for mc 
al Sneaky Pete's basement where 
the bands load up equipment 
and look me to the tloor in the 
(reighl elevator. Dodging the 
ever-presenl sound engineer, I 



took my seal next to Ihe various 
members of Ihe bands who were 
on the bill for the evening. 

However. I came to the real- 
ization that conversing was 
becoming more o[ an impossibil- 
ity Anticipation was growing in 
Ihe crowd as some or the patrons 
look to playing to pool Io deal 
with their excilement, while 
most hit the bar. The events that 
followed the night could be 
hypothesized as being a direct 
result of that. 

Finally, aFler hearing Ihe 
pleas from Ihe crowd and finish- 
ing their long soundcheck, Fisled 
Sisler played their scl in a man- 
ner similar to how they said they 
practiced it a mere three limes 
that nighl — and Ihat was fast 
and sloppy. They all had energy 
and a slagc presence Ihat will 
probably nol be forgotten (or 
some time at Sneaky Pete's. 



After Fisled Sisiei leli the 
stage. Fort VVajTie idols, Fal Ass, 
began their set. Again, another 
set Ihat was fast, and above else, 
it was loud. Fat Ass proved Io 
Ihe people al Sneaky Pete's why 
Ihey personify rock 'n' roll in the 
Summit Cily. Evil Presly, vocalist 
of the Independents, euen 
explained Io Enck Coleman, gui- 
tarist of Fat Ass, that the audi- 
ence couldn't really hear the 
vocals. Coleman jus I responded, 
"Well, Ihat is kind of our thing." 
That is an attitude that almost 
makes mc cry for joy. 

After some pleas from the 
audience nol to leave the stage, 
Fal Ass exiled, leaving room for 
the Independents. Now. Ihe 
Independents look like a group 
of bikers from outer space who 
landed in a remote swamp in the 
American sotitheasi and their 
sound complements their look. 



They are ore part ska, one 
part old school punit and the Sun 
Records influence is i(\cscapable. 
The singer is not donned Evil 
Presly (or nothing. Even Presly 
carmol slay on the stage for most 
of Ihe show, instead he lakes to 
crooning the audience, making 
an effort to be seen by every 
patron. With so much rock and 
so much laleni, it is no wonder 



To Ihe dismay of many of 
Ihe patrons, the Independents 
eidted for the Lurking Corpses to 
play their renditions of horror 
rock perfect for Ihe Halloivecn 
season. All and all it was a great 
show, and a vvonderful free show 
thai 1 almost (ett guilly about 
sneaking inio, but 1 did consider 
buying a shirt.

'Bang Bang You're Dead' drives home the many causes of school violence 



risk. 



"When you label a kid a

words from the mouth of teacher 
Val Duncan in the Showtime 
original movie "Bang Bang 
You're Dead." 

Duncan, played by Tom 
Cavanaugh, is une of the main 
players in the movie biised on a 
play of the same name. The play 
Bang Dang You're Dead" was 
wrillen in 1999 by William 
Mastrosimone. 

Around one month after the 
Jones bo ro school shootings and 
just one week after Ihe shootings 
in Springfield, Maslrosimone 
wrole Ihe play in his Enumclaw, 
Wash, home. 

Maslrosimone began Ihe 
play one nighl after one of his 
children causally mentioned 
during dinner thai a sludcnt had 
scribed "I'm going to kill every- 
one in Ibis class. And Ihe teacher 
loo," on a blackboard in his 

Shaken bv the Ihreal. 
Maslrosimone was unable to 
sleep thai nighl. Thu4, th'e first 



draft of "Bang Bang You'i 
Dead" came to life. 

Maslrosimone wrole Ihe 
play directed at any polenlial 
kilter, any kid in Ihe auoiencc of 
the play ihat currently had or 
harbored any homicidal feelings 



High School, f believe lliat the 
ivorld ivas in need for something 
just like Ihis movie. When 
Showtime went Io Maslrosimone 
ilh Ihe idea, he must have (ell 



the- 






; Columbine as my 
main point. It was on April 20. 
1999. Ihat America woke up and 
realized that the trend of vio- 
lence in schools is all loo real. 

In my eslimation, Dylan 
KIcbold and Eric Harris may 
have done us all a favor. If Ihe 
thought processes of these killers 
is truly what "Bang Bang You're 
Dead portrays it Io be, maybe 
Klcbol/and Harris can in some 
way be considered heroes. 

Maybe Ihey did what Ihey 
had Io do Io stop Ihe strain of 
mental and physical abuse in our 
schools. 



In the movie, Ben Foster 
portrays Trevor Adams. Trevor 
was once the typical student. He 
was at school to do his work and 
gel through Ihe days. Then, 
when football players Biad 
(David Paetkau) and Mark {Eric 
Johnson) embarrassed Trevor in 
(roni of (he cnlire school, Trevor 
became more than your average 

Trevor was soon kicked out 
of school for threatening Io blow 
up the football Icam that Brad 
and Mark were pari of. The 
movie opens on Ihe firsl day of 
school Ihe next year. Trevor is 
returning to Ihe school and is 
quickly faced wilh ridicule (rom 
other students and conslani 
searches from school officials 
and police officers. 

Shortiv into Ihe day. Trevor 
IS shown Ihe play "Bang Dang 
You're Dead" by his teacher Mr. 
Duncan and Ihal is where Ihe 
real e mo I ion begins. 

Trevor is very reluctant Io 
expose himself Io Ihe students 
and teachers who refer to him as 
'The Mad Bomber' by porlray- 
ing a killer in a school produc- 
tion. Trevor declines to be part of 
the production until he meels the 



school's newest sludcnt. lenny. 
played by Jane McGregor, 

Soon afler, Trevor is 
befriended by a defiant group of 
students known as Ihe Trogs. 
Referred to by one sludenl as the 
"freakiest of Ihe freaks," the 
Trogs begin Io challenge Ihe pop- 
ular jocks' sense of sclf-entille- 
ment and supremacy. Scan 
(Randy Harrison), who has a 
kind of leadership of Ihe Trogs, 
begins a conllicl wilh slar fool- 
ball player Brad thai escalates 
from minor pranks into danger 



The

s of 



defiance. 

Afler a violent allack by Ihe 
football team Ihat leaves Scan 
bloody and bruised, the Trogs 
decide to make the final move m 
the deadly game. 

Faced wilh the thought that 
his friends are going Io wage an 
assault on Ihe school. Trevor 
must face Ihe impending conse- 
quences of Ihe Trogs' decision 
and musl weigh his feelings and 
Ihe I me meaning of friendship in 
the climactic point in the movie, 

I'm not the kind of person 
Io give away much of Ihe slory, 
so Iwill let you become aware of 
Ihe details on your own. 



infor- 
1 Ihe 
movie is whal Maslrosimone 
feels goes on inside Ihe head o( a 
potential killer. Through Ihc 
characters Sean, Kurt (Kristian 
Ayre). Zach (Brenl Clenen) and 
Trevor, Maslrosimone sends out 
Ihe message Ihat the actions of 
other sludcnls arc what drives 
Ihese children to Ihe edge. 

There is one phrase Ihal 
Trevor makes in regard Io his 
peers on one of his video lapcs in 
the movie Ihat really gels Ihis 
point across and sent chills down 
my spine. 

"Tliey give you a name. The 
name docs something to you. It 
changes who you arc. It alters 
your molecules. And one day 
you wake up. and you look in 
ihe mirror and you don't recog- 
nize you anymore because you 
believe them, and then one day 
Ihey say Ihat name and you hear 
something go snap. You realize 
what you have to do. You have 
to lake your name back, 

"And you have to do il in 
front of the whole school 
because that's where Ihey took 
your name from you." 

In Ihe wake of the school 



shootings of the lale '906, partic- 
ularlv Columbine, the media and 
ncarlv Ihe entire population tar- 
geted so many outlets as the 
cause for Ihe unconceivable; 
behavior. From music to televi- 
sion and everything in between, 
we were all searching for. 
answers, Mastrosimone gives 
those ansivers with his play and 
this movie. 

Sure, people will turn Ihcir 
nose up at Ihe concept of such a&lt; 
movie. Of course Ihe critics will 
slam the ideas that are por- 
trayed. But it's time for everyone 
Io open Ihcir eyes. Mastrosimone 

foes somewhere wilh "Bang 
ang You're Dead" Ihal nobody 
has dared logo, 

"Bang Bang You're Dead" is 
the definitive movie of this era. 
The words to describe Ihe emo- 
tions thai it provokes cannot be 

Everyone should see Ihis 
movie. Maybe it will answer 
Ihosc unanswered questions, 
and maybe it won't, 

Bui il gets Ihe point across. 
It will make vou think about our 
society anci deeply examine 
what IS the rool of the problem.

Fatigue catches up with Dons in loss

cau^t up to IhclPFW men's soccer team Friday as 
the Dons were shut out by Akron 4-0 at Hefner

"After those four games that we played in six 
days, they've paid more of a price on it tonight 
than ever," said IPFW coach Terry Stefankiewic?. 
'This wasn't our leam. Nobody riad lheir lees. It

Did You Know: 
Changing faces and 
changing places 



lukftr in 1957 and Allanta i 



Fans in Los Angeles wore oulragcd in I960 when 
ihe new Lakers owners refused to change the learn 
name after i move from Minnesota. 



Pio-wresller Glen Jacobs has portrayed si 
ftfrenl characters in his eighl-year career, 
recent being Kane with VVWE. 

When Chris Webber was traded to Ihe Sacramento 
Kings in 1998, he refused to unpack his posses- 
sions for several months in hope of another trade. 

The liavens and the Titans arc the only NFL teams 
to change Ihcir names after relocating. The runner- 
up in bolh teams' choices for names: the Vipers. 



Only one learn in sports history has relocated from 
the Unilcd Stales to Canada. The Atlanta Flames 
became Ihe Calgary Flames in 1980. 

NHL and NFL learns that have relocated have only 
been in their respective championship finals a total 
of seven Umes since the move, compared to the 
eight appearances before Ihe moves. 



Ironman. bul he s hard pressed to .slay in one 
pl.ice. Rudd has had full-lime jobs driving the No 
2 Wrangler, No. 26 Quaker Slale, No. 5 and No. 10 
Tide and No, 28 Tesaco cars in his 25-year career. 
Rudd moves lo his sixlh learn next season when he 
lakesover theNo.21 Molorcrafl car. 

Pra-wrcsller ScotI Levy has had live gimmicks in 
his career, but nol until his most recent did he 
achieve success. As Raven, Levy has had 36 title 
reigns in WWE. WCW and ECW. 

Talk aboul overstaying your welcome! Oris Carter 
recenllv signed a deal wilh the Miami Dolphins 
after playing 14 seasons as a Minnesota Viking. 

Anyone confused about ivhere MLB's Angels are 
from? Despite staying in relatively Ihe same area, 
the Angels have been known as Los Angeles, 
California and Anaheim in Ihe last 10 years. 

The NflA's mosi recent relocaled franchise, the 
Memphis Grizzlies, has ruled out looking for a 
new name after the move from the mass-grizzly 
populated Vancouver. Few know that theCri/.zUes 
name came just three weeks before Ihe 1995 expan- 
sion draft. Prior lo Ihal, the team was set lo be 
named the Vancouver Beavers. 

Terrell Owens has been a San Francisco 49er for his 
entire career. So why mention him with a new 
place? Well, this man is Ihe innovalor of finding 
new places for things. 1 mean, who else is vain 
enough to place a Sharpie in his sock to autograph 
a football after a touchdown? 

My Changing Faces and Changing Places pick of 
the week is this: The Anaheim Angels. What's their 
new place you ask? The World Series and Ihe win 
column. Il's lough to predict a winner because it's 
adoseseriesonpapcr. but I think Barry Bonds will 
find some way lo cheat. Belter luck nexl year 
Angels, you'll need it. Can anyone say 1997 Florida 
Marlins?

Kicking dream 

From page 7 

River City Rhmos, the South 
Bpnd Vipers of the Michigan 
Ko&lt;itb.-ill Lengiie, the Allen 
County Explosion of Ihe Federal 
Football League and the 
Southern Michigan Tunlienvolvcs 
of the Mid-Conlinenlal Football 

Then, in 2001, Clawsoo 
moved indoors and played half 
a season with Ihe Louisville Fire 
oi Arena Football 2, the Arena 
Football League's triple A 

Noting that the goalposts 
in the AFL and NIFL are nar- 



rower than those in the National 
Football League, Clawson feels 
that kicking in indoor football is 
moredifficult than it is in the NFL 
"It's a little different, 
because you've got a shorter 
field, which is kind of nio;, bul 
il's a lilllc tougher, because NFL 
goalposts are IB feet wide and 
AFL goalposts are only nine 
feel," he said. 'The ones here 
wilt be 10 feet wide, because it's 
a little different league. It's still 
tough and still a narrow target. 

lo be any good at Ihls. Even 
mediocre in this league is dead- 
ly accurate." 

How accurate is Clawson? 
Well, during his time ivilh the 



Fire, he nailed the third-longest 
field goal in league history al 54 

Although he is working 






nthet 



IPFW, Clawson dreams that 
someday he will be kicking at 
football s highest level. 

"I've still got the belief that 
I can make it to the NFL," he 
said. "1 know it's going lo lake a 
lot of work, because there's a lot 
of competition in Ihe kicking 
position. You find that wherever 
you %o, bul I still believe I can 
make it to Ihal level." 

The next step to reaching 
that level may be just a phone
