Program connects students and alumni 

E-mentoring is beneficial to everyone involved 



K 



Edilor 



As of September of Ihis year, IPiHA' studcnls 
now have a valuable networking resource, as 
wcli as a way to 'lesl Ihe wjicrs' of various 
careers lo see i( Ihey might be rigtil lor llieiii. A 
new e-mentoringprograni. whicfi Is available on- 
line, connects IPf^ students and alumru so that 
they can discuss issues relating lo whatever 
career the student is interested in 

Students .ind alumni sign up for the pro- 
gram at &lt;htlpV/www.monslprlrak.com/slu- 
dcnls/unrcg/contacl.html&gt;. Registration is (rcc 
and open lo any student or alumni o( IPFW, 

The program, ivhich is the brain-child of the 
Alumm Relations deparlmeni at IPRV is beine 
implemented by Academic Career and 
Counseling Services and Alumni Relations. II 
gives students Ihe opporlunily to make connec- 
tions and network while still sitting at their com- 
puter at home or on campus. 

In fact, hundreds of participants have 
already signed up lor Ihe program and dre reap- 
ing some of its many rewards. Benefits from the 
program exisLfor both the studcnls and Ihe alum- 
ni who participate. 

"Students have Ihe ability lo Icam if they are 
on the right track education ivisc. lo possibly 
spend a day at a comoany, to network with peo- 
ple m their field and lo have doors opened or 
conlacls made via their mentor lo help them find 
a job." said Jennifer Bosk, director of Alumni 
Relations. 

Once students are paired with on alumni in 
their field Ihev can decide how often they will 
talk via e-mail and whether or not Ihey want lo 
extend Ihe mentoring to include corporate visits. 



networking events or one-on-onc sessions. 

'For the alumni who parlicipale, it might 
work into an internship or a new hire, il allows 
the alum lo hear about what Is new in their field 
that is being taught in the dassnjoms. Most 
alums wish to give back lo their alma maler so 
this is one of Ihe simplest ways," added Bosk. 

The program can also be useful lo students 
who arc undecided about Ihe field Ihat they wish 
to pursue alter graduation Students may have 

opportunity' to talk to a variety o( people 
employed m different fields. Students can also 
find out first hand what various careers are real- 
ly like and whether or not opportunities cxisl in 
me field that they mav be interested in. 

ACCS keeps Iraek of the number of students 
and alumni participating in the program and 
which programs they arc working at/intcrcsted 
in. Surprisingly, given Ihe dramatic enrollment 
increase in Ihe Health Sciences Deparlmeni (22 
percent) this year, no one field in Ihe program is 
standing out as being more popular than another 

Most of the alumni enrolled in the program 
right now are local, which is more convenient in 
terms of visiting the alumni's business. Then? are 
some alum in Ine program, though, who arc not 
in Fort Wavne. which could be beneficial in terms 
of networking for those students who want to 
relocate alter graduation. 

According to Bosk, this program is "valu- 
able lo students because you never can gel too 
much inlormation to help oneself. And the possi- 
bility to have someone open doors to potential 
gobs is vital in today's market. 

More information about Ihe program is 
available on Ihe Web site.

Neither my roommate nor I 
decided to bring d scI. 1 remem-

guy over the phone. We bolh 
agreed thai having no TV was 
going to be a good aspect of our

It also had a projector that 
i (and almost everyone else 
who wcnl lo the films on a reg-

plenty o( lelcvisions at lU. Nol 
seeing the value in becoming a 
Greek (I was a little intimidated 
after a fellow lU freshman 
drowned on his own vomit 
while trying lo get inio a fral), 1 
was forcca lo seek enlerlain- 
mcnl elsewhere. It wasn't too 
hard lo grow familiar with and 
become, more or less, a 'regu- 
lar' al a few places on the lU 
campus. 

[ fell right al home at the 
movie thealer that played art 
house films. It was a grand 
place and a grand lime, as peo- 
ple used lo say. The Ihcaler. 
open on Ihe weekends, was 
located in a dingy, aging lecture 
hall in Ihc ad school. 

The lecture hall also hap- 
pened lo (imctiqn as a small 
Iheaire wilh a projt'clion house 
and a screen at ihc front oi Ihe 
classroom, soil ol like the psy- 
chology lecture hall over in 
Keltlcr. Similarly, this one had 
uncomfortable seals, the backs

soil, gum and archival graffiti

as basic as you can get. but it 
was dirt cheap and quality 
enter la ioment. I saw plenty of 
amusing and interesting for- 
eign and American films that 
never made it lo Ihc big screen. 
My olher pastime in place 
o( watching TV became my 
(aunis lo Ihe lU library. I don I 
doubt thai there arc bigger and 
belter libraries in the United 
Slates. Thai's not really impor- 
lanl. The lU librarv is massive, 
especially the graduate side of 
Ihe building. Split into two 
sides (Ihe other being Ihc 
undergraduate side), the build- 
ing must have had a million or 

The graduate side has, I 
thinly, 10 or 12 floors. Each floor 
is brimming wilh slacks upon 
slacks of books. These slacks 
reach nearly lo Ihe 10-fool ceil- 
ings. The first time I went there.

o the u 



graduate side of Ihc building. 
It's not nearly as impressive, 
but for me il was still over- 
whelming. Honestly, I couldn'l 
figure out how to use the 
library catalog Ihc first lime I 
went there, I think t was look- 
ing (or Nabakov's "Lolita." I 
must have walked through 
each of Ihe fiVc floors on Ihe 
undergraduate side looking lor 



library wasn't the 
most pleasant. 1 found my book 
but with plenty of trouble. The 
ncKl lime I went there. I learned 
the library c atalo g inside and 
out. It's nol IhaFaifficuTl. I also 
explored Ihe graduate side of 
the building. Still looking for 
another book (1 think il must 
have been a limited cdilion, 
obscure John Updike volume ol 
shorl stories given lo Ihc 
library by Ihe author), I walked 
through several floors of Ihe 



library, at last finding Ihe book. 
This became a sorl of pat- 
tern for me on week nights. I 
spent plenty of lime in the 
slacks of the graduate side of 
Ihc library. 1 didn'l really have 
one specific favorite place or 
floor, I had a number o[ Ihem. 
My favorite places were graKi- 
li-covered desks and tables hid- 
den among the slacks. 

lured to study al one of the 
grad students personal desks. 
These were inlcrcsling in that 
you could learn exactly what 
the grad student was doing his 
or her thesis on. And later, if 1 
had stayed long enough at [U. 1 
probably would have started 
recognizing some ol the names 
on tlie published theses that 
occupied several stacks on one 
floor of the library These were 
bound, sometimes thick black 
books of typeset print that 
some grad student &gt;t3d spent 
hours and hours writing. 1 
never read to far into any of Ihe 
theses, and I don't remember 
any of the titles. 

Even during the second 
semester [ was al iU when I 
had a TV, I still made regular 
trips lo the library and Ihe art 
house theater. I didn't watch 
much TV but recall a feeling 
that had 1 not had the TV, I 
probably tuould have fell like I

trying lo distance myself from

younger. I never thought about 
watching TV much until I gol 
to college. Having no TV 
around allowed me plenty o( 
lime lo contemplate the fad 
that 1 had no TV to watch. I 
didn'l gel loo plVilosophical 
about il. 1 just merely Ihought

There's nothing worse than

Il's one thing lo be rejected

One o( Ihe

Ihose with unslaMc or erratic 
pi&gt;rsonalities. Many think th.it 
Ihey, being wcll-bj lanced, mild- 
lempered and normally genial, 
are therefore immune lo depres- 
sion. "This is nol Irue." Jacobs 



depression may be genetic or 
olhetwise biological. Often it is 
caused by an imbalance of chem- 
icals in the brain thai cany com- 
munication between nerve cells 
thai control mood as well as 
other bodily systems. Stress, 
mcdicatiorxs and certain person- 
ality Irails can also add lo this, 
causing depression. 

Some symptoms of depres- 
sion include a persistent sad. 
arviious or emply mood; feelings 
of hopelessness or pessimism; 
decreased energy; fatigue and 
leelines of guill. woithlessness 
or he^lessness. If these svmp- 
toms ore experienced anci last

screening should be considered.

They're all talking about 
Amina Lawal, the young unwed 
mother who laces a dealh sen- 
li'nce for having a child out of 
wedlock in Nigeria. The way the 
media portrays the whole story 
IS as though Nigerians are bar- 
baric and Afghanistan II, no 
pun intended. As a Nigerian. I 
really feel the need to speak up 



this i; 



- there's really 
mure tO Nigeria than Laival and 
what has been portrayed. 

For anyone who does not 
know Ihe full story, Lawal is a

families especially relatives and 
in-laws who cannot take can; of 
themselves due to disability or 
illness. Nigerians are a very 
warm, friendly, respectful and 
welcoming people. Women arc 
treated well and aie considered 

There are many notable 
female Nigerians such as 
Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti tor 
example, a woman's right 
activist. She was the first woman 
lo drive in Nigeria and is the 
mother ol Fela Kuti, a renowned 
musician (his CDs are available 
locally); Dr. Ransome-Kuti, a 
former health minister who 
helped spreads AIDS awareness 
in Nigeria and Beko Ransome- 
Kuti, a human rights activist. 
Three of those individuals have 
received numerous awards, both 
inlernational and in Nigeria 

Another notable Nigerian 
woman is Flora Nwapa. a 
famous Nigerian writer who is 



known for being the first African 
woman to publish a book in 
English. She was also an admin- 
istrator, teacher, cabinet minister 
and owned her o*vn publishing 
company. She died in 1993 at the 
age of 62. 

Incidentally, the current 
Miss World is a Nigerian, 
Agbani Dorego. 

Nigerians are also a very 
religious people, the majority of 
which are either Muslim or 
Christian. Some practice tradi- 
tional warship; some Ibos for 
instance, believe that everyone 
has a little god. a personal chi, 
that guides them thtoughout life

One ol the most interesting 
parts of Nigerian culture is the 



style of dress. Nigerians nre very 
flamboyant when it comes to 
clolhine, Nigerian women espe- 
cially, love jewelry and ethnic 
clothes like Aso-Oke, Kaftan, 
Ceoree and Danshiki. 

There are over 250 tribes in 
Nigeria and each tribe has their 
unique style of dressing, food 
and language. The most com- 
mon Nigerian languages arc Ibo, 
from e.istern Nigeria; Yoruba 
from western Nigeria; and 
Hausa from northern Nigeria. 
More information about Nigeria's 
rich culture is available al

JusI as every great country 
has things in its history that il is 
not proud of like sl.ivcry in the 
United Stales, Japanese camps 
during WWII and Russian atom- 
ic bomb testing in I-Iirashim3, 
this is one of the country's nolso 
great moments. Hopefully, this 
will make Nigerians stronger, 
just like the s.id events of 9/11

Blame it on Rio debut a disappointment, shows promise 



Spor/.s IVrilff 

Did I miss somelhing? 
Wasn't Fori WaynL- supposed lo 
be 3 backbone of rock? Isn't Ihis 
3 town Ihjt lijs produced 
Abrahiim, All Pain h»Av and 
Skovm.is? So what m.nl.r.'s cvcry- 



(tiuch alcohol and not enough 
brain cells. 

I don'l want lo step off on 
Ihp entirely wrong loot here. 
Blame II On Rio isn't all Ihat bad. 
1 actually found a dccenl portion 
of their album "20 Seconds lill 4 
ever" lo be enjiiyable and 

So what's my problem wilh 
Ihe chords Ihal pump Ihrough 
my JVC headphones when 
Blame It On Rio is in my CD 
player? Thai's simple — I could 
gel Ihe same sound by Ihrowing 
nearly any pop/punk CD in Ihe 
CD player In a lime when 
pop/punk and rocV: are laking 



over the music world. Ihe key to 
success IS onginalily. something 
thai Blame ll On Rio severely 
lacks. 

The opening Irack "Gel Up 
Again" is among (he belter 
Iracks on ihe CD, but Ihe cross- 
ing of main and background 
vocals leave* parts of the song in 
an entangled mess. On an album 
tvhcic the vocals are lacking lo 
say Ihe leasl, you never want lo 
make the listener try lo decipher 
Ihe lyrics like Blame It On Rio 
does on Ihis track. 

The second track "Junflth" 
makes very litlle sense which is 
acluolly good news (or most 
bands of this genre. Abraham 
(irsl achieved fame with their 
tracks full of pointless lyrics. 

The Ihird track "Sorry 
Baby" is perhaps the (vorsi song 
I have heard from a local band. 
The lyrics highlight a palhelieal- 
ly melodic dose of Blame II On 
Rio at its raw. unrelenting worst. 
1 can honestly say Ihat my ears 
thanked Ihe CD when this track 



iorry Baby" w 
ly (ID player 



finally llnished and I don'l thmk 
ill be playmg on 
again anytime 

As a huge Good Charlotte 
fan. 1 did absolutely enjoy every 
second of the fourth song 
"Missing Person." This track is 
wiihout a doubt Ihe highlight of 
this album. It showcases the 
most originality thai Blame It On 



Rioca 



, pump oi 



But. just when they capture 
my allcntion. Blame II On Rio 
give me Ihe repetitive "Summer 
of 'eg."' As 1 listen to this song. I 
can't help but think that Blame II 
On Rio recycled the ideas of sev- 
eral Green Day songs and put 
some new lyrics in (or sentimen- 
tal value. 

Tracks six and seven, "Airborne" 
and "So Long," showcase the 
main reasons why Blame ll On 
Rio's guitar playing isn't win- 
ning Inem any awards. The Iwo 
keep up the bland 



of 



pop/punk Ihat 



oh-si 



&gt;uld . 



make Mark HopussicL 

"Rule the World" slarls oil 
with a good guilar/drum combo 
that is completely spoiled by 
those boring vocals once again. 

A small glimpse of ongmal- 
ity shows Ihrough on "No 
Curlew." Not only does the 
group slow the music up a bit, 
the lyrics actually show good 
substance. The background 
vocals could use some help, but 
they are Ihc sole thorn stopping 
Ihis Irack from bordering on 

At this point, my interest in 
the CD once agam goes (rom a 10 
lo 3 three when "Like you 
Seller" slaits lo play. The lyrics 
go too fast and Ihe ramblmgs are 
barely recogniiable. To make 
matters worse, the voice-over, 
white used pathetically, is barely 
heard over the inslrumcnlals. 
After the voice speaks. Blame It 
On Rio decided lo Just insert a 
screaming part lo the song for no 
apparent reason. 

"She's Everything" and 



"Bindmgs" arc simply keeping 
up the trend ol over-hyped, bor- 
ing pop /punk. 

But between those patheti- 
cally similar Iracks is whal I con- 
sider Ihe break out track o( Ihe 
album. Blame 11 On Rio tests the 
waters o( the omo world with 
"Goodbye." The difference is 
that this lime Ihe group doesn't 
bury themselves. 

The melodic acoustic Irack 
is a heartwarming piece of the 
mindset of Ihc group. If more of 
the songs sounded like this, I 
would tell everyone thai Blame 
11 On Rio was a musl-have CD. 
It's mainly because of this song 
that I would actually purchase 
this CD. 

"Goodbye" is a song that 
stands atone at Ihe top of the 
lepelilive tracks, bui don'l gel 
your hopes up. My money says 
ihat Blame II On Rio will soon 
shy away (rom emo and keep up 
the sad siring of so-called punk 
thai sounds like Ihe Backstreet 
Boys with colds.

Well, ncwsHash lime for

Ming ivill jusi be another wasl-

My monev for rookie of

Dunlcavy Perhaps the best all- 
around rookie itie league has 
ever seen. Dunlcavy's size 
helps him move around ilisidc 
Willi the big boys, bul his shol 
could som climes even make 
Reggie Miller salivate. 

The problem once again

Iheir new tcammales posess. 

The bcsl foreign player lo 
come oul of the draft is Nikoloz 
Tskitishvili. He is a pure linese 
player and would be a poten- 
tial AU-Siar Ihis year If he was- 
n't stuck in Denver with the 
always palhelic Nuggets. 

The two guys Ihat will

Dixon and Dan Dickau, Bul 
once again, the Wizards and 
Ihe Hawks arc nol CKaclly play-

The onll second round 
steal will end up being Ihe 
dominate Carlos Booier in 
Cleveland. He'll turn heads, 
and 1 expect to sec him starling 
by laic- December, 

So, lei's start our evalua- 
tions out in the Western 
Conference. 

The Midwest Division 
should be a highly competitive 
division. Obviously, the 
Memphis Grizzlies will come 
in lasl in the division again. 
Maybe they can relocate alter 
another embarrasing season 
with a potenlifll all-star roster. 
If Shane Batlier and Pau Gasol 
can't pull this Icam oul of thi 



gullei 



in the r 






have one word to solve Ihe 
problem: Contraction. The rest 
of the division should be strong 
with the other six teams all in 
playoff contention. II wouldn't 
suprise me lo sec Ihis division 
takes five of the available eight 



only three teams making it lo 
Ihe playoHs from Ihis division. 
The Kings, Ihe Los Angles 
Lakers and Ihe Portland Trail 
Blazers will lead Ihe way out 
wesl. While Pheonix. Golden 
Stale and Seattle will all fmish 
under 500 lor the season. 

The Clippers will make a 
valiant effort lo make Ihe play- 
offs, but will fall short yet 
again. Maybe after Ihal. every- 
one aIHgned with the team will 
realize Ihat being a Clipper is 
NBA purgatory. 

The fate ol the Eastern 
Conference is nol as obvious. 
Nearly every leam could have 
a chance lo make the playoffs. 
Bul il will also be the end of Ihe 
road for several individuals. 

This could be the end for 
Michael Jordan, It's sad lo see 
the greatest of all-lime make a 
comeback and sink inlo obscu- 

.ly like he has, Hopt 

ike Charles Oakley 
and ride oft inlo Ihc sunsei 
come mid-April, 

The Atlantic Division will 
be the most highly conlesled 
division Ihis year. 11 may take 
an upset or a miracle to win 
this division. 

Four Icams will emerge 
into the playoffs, but all seven 
will be in contention. The rein- 
vented Boston Celtics will lead 
Ihe way Ihis year in Iheir 
search lo reclaim the champi- 
onship spirit. Paul Pierce and 
Antoine Walker will leave no 
stone unlumcd by the end of 
the regular season- 
Jason Kidd will lead the 
New Jersey Nets most of Ihe 
way lo Ihe playolls, bul looks 
for Dikcmbe Mulumbo (o be 
Ihe key in the Nels lale season 
sucess. Philadelphia will gel it's 
game together and go lo the 
playolls on Ihc back of some- 
one other than Allen Iverson, 
Look lor Keilh Van Horn lo 
chase Ihc championship dream, 
lor Ihc 76ers this year 

And finally, the Orlando 
Magic will do what Ihcy have 
been destined lo do lot Ihrec 



New Jersey by helping Ihe 
76ors eliminate the favorites in 
Ihe first round, Boston will end 
Ihe Cinderella run of 
Cleveland. New Orleans will 
give Reggie and Ihe Pacers a 
firsl round bool and the new 
power of Ihe EasI in Orlando 
will take oul Detroit in a first 
round sweep. 

Out wesl. Sacramento will 
embarass Portland in Ihe open- 
ing round. Shaq will lead Ihc 
Lakers past Ming and the 
Rockets. Minnesota w'ill sink 
The Admiral's ship in San 
Antonio and Dallas will deliver 
a knock out blow to the ailing 



live gan 



The following rounds will 
be full of hot heads and the 
need for anger managcmcni. 
Round two will sec Boston take 
il to Iverson and the Sixers. 
Baron Davis' unseen abililv 
won't be enough as Grant Hill 
and Ihc Magic will keep Ihe 
dream alive, Ihc Timbewolves 
will end the drive for four by 
eliminating the Lakers in scvei 
games and Sacramenlo wil 
bring an end lo Dallas' season 

The conference champi 
onship scries will both come |i 
a halt alter six games. The 
explosive Celtics will seek to 
add another banner lo the 
rafters by eliminating Orlando 
3-2, Sacramenlo will go head- 
to-head in a thrilling battle 
with Mirmesota, bul Cameil 
won't be able lo slow dovvn a 
Kings leam that is destined for 
Ihe championship. 

In the 2003 NBA Finals, 
Ihe Kings will win games 
three. Tour and five v 



be in shock as Webber, Bibby, 
Slojakovic, Christie. Divac and 
Ihe rest of the Kings re|Oice 
Iheir firsl ever NBA 
Chanipionship. 

Granled, if Webber does- 
n't play this year, the Kings 
won't even make il past round
