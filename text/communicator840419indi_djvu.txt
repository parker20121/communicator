IPFW suggests 
April advising 

By ANNETTE ROY 
Staff Writer 

Wha! may seem like a hassle to many students this spring is actually "a con- 
Wlexiseffortloseparaleadvisiiigand reglslraUon," said Donna Worlhley. director 
of Student Academic Counseling Services. 

Students In certain programs including engineering, technology, nursing, arts 
and letters and science and humanities have been notified that they must meet 
with an adviser during April to plan for the fall, IBM semester. 

"Too many students wait until July for advising, and they might not be getting 
good a vising,' 1 Worthle&gt; said. She Mid some of Ihe faculty members may nol be 
herein July, but thai every' office will be Available at registration time in the foil, 

Worthley said the Committee of Academic Advising, made upol representatives 
from every academic unll and herself serving as chair, recommended the April 
advising to the vice chancellor so that each individual student will lake lime to 
plan a quality education The recommendation also gave each academic unit the 
choice lo make the April deadline. Worthley said 

"The April advising is for continuing students— those who are in school now and 
will beinthefall.■' Worthley said 

For these who do not know what their fall work schedule or lifestyle may belike. 
Worthley said they should still find out what classes they need to take, but they do 
not have to plan specific class times. 

"There Is no real policy or enforcement with the deadline," Worthley said.

Gingrich receives chemistry fellowship 



An IPFW chemistry major has been 
accepted for a six-week summer 
fellowship in nuclear chemistry at San 
JoscStale University in California 

John Gingrich, a junior chemistry 
student, has been chosen as one of 12 
students to participate In an ac- 
celerated undergraduate program 
sponsored by the Division of Nuclear 
Chemistry o( the American Chemical 
Society. 

The program will consist of lectures, 
labs, a guest lecture scries and field 



Some of the places Gingrich will visit 
in association with the fellowship are

NASA-Ames Lab, The General 
Electric Nuclear Facility and the

All coats to participate in the 
program are covered by the American 
Chemical Society. Including trans-

college In the Unl led Stales that offers 
an undergraduate degree In nuclear 



"I'm very anxious to go and see what 
the program is like." Gingrich told the 
Communicator "When I found out that 
this summer fellowship was available 
I decided that I couldn't afford to not 
apply" 

"The program Is an honor, and John 
is worthy of it as a student," said 
Kenneth Sieve mon, chair oT the 
department of chemistry 

Gingrich recently won an award at 
the Science and Humanities Honors 
Banquet as the outstanding analytical 
chemistry student. The award is based

seven year enlistment in the Navy's 
nuclear power program During his 
service in the Navy, Gingrich became 
more interested in studying nuclear 
power andchemistry at a university. 

"After having sci en years of nuclear 
school in the Navy, this fellowship was 
right up my alley," he said. "I think 
m&gt; rxpvrience was a help in getbng 
accepted to the program." 

Stevenson said. "John ought to be 



commended for going to the 
fellowship Many programs of this 
type are available to students who just 
don't take the initiative loapply." 

When asked what he hoped lo learn 
at the summer school Gingrich said. 
"Among other things. I hope to learn 
more about radioactive waste and

problem In the world today."

If you believe that with your In- 
terests and skills you will make a good 
nurse or that you have the ability lo 
train as an engineer, career counseling 
can give you a battery of tests to help 
you decide what career your skills and 
values might boused In. 

The tests arc offered to students, 
prospective students and alumni 
"These tests must be Interpreted by 
trained professionals," Robert 
Barkhaus, director of counseling 
Placementond Testing, said. 

"Moat people think of counseling and 
testing as narrowing down their 
choices. Usually ft broadens them by 
showing students a couple of areas 
they may not have considered," 

A two part career assessment course 
was sponsored by the office of Con- 
tinuing Education, on March 19. 
Results will be discussed April 26. 
About 20 people took the test. 
Residents of Fort Wayne and outlying 
districts were reached with In-

opinion 



IPFW increases fees 



McDonalds used to have a commercial 
In which a customer bought a meal and 
was surprised, when he gol change back 
from his dollar. 

A few years ago. IPFW could have had 
a similar commercial, where a student 
would get change back from a $100 bill 
for a three-credit hour course. 

This fall, that same IPFW student will 
have to fork over S 127 35 to the univer- 
sity lor that same three-credit hour 

Students are once again being asked to 
foot a larger portion ot the bill for an 
adequate education. 

John Carnaghi, vice chancellor for 
financial affairs, said the fee increase is 
needed to help compensate faculty 
members 

IPFW, along with the other campuses 
of the two universities, fear faculty 
members will move into the private 
sector if not adequately compensated. 
This is a genuine fear. However, it 



doesn't justify increasing the tuition. 

Students should not be paying a larger 
share of the burden to compensate 
faculty members, the stale should. After 
all, faculty members are employees of 
the state or Indiana. 

The entire slate of Indiana benefits 
from its slate uniyersities, not just the 
students attending those universities. 
Unfortunately, many IPFW students 
don't have a choice of where they want to 
attend college because of other com- 
mitments. 

IPFW students and the students' 
government should lobby the general 
assembly in the future to adequately 
compensate faculty members, thus 
keeping tuition down. The students of 
both universities throughout the state 
have been shortchanged by the boards of 
trustees' actions. Students are the one 
group that cannot afford to pay a fee 
increase every year.

fectiveness of the IPFW
