OFFICII 



Have you ever considered 
how "Army Officer" 

would look on 
your job application? 

An interview with Major Dick Reinholtz, Army 



"Many employers can 
give you the answer. 
Because to fill respons- 
ible jobs, they often look 
for college graduates 
who have held respons- 
ible jobs. 

"A 3 an Army officer, 
you have to manage men, 
materials, and money. 
Your first year out of 
college, you shoulder 
greater responsibilities, 
at an earlier age, than 
most other graduates. 

"So it's no wonder that 
many employers, looking 
for demonstrated leader- 
ship, rate "Army offic- 
er" above most other 
qualifications. Or why 
career minded college 
students so often take 
Army ROTC. 

"I n addition to what 
Army ROTC can mean to 
you after college, there 
are many important ben- 
efits while you're in 
college. Scholarship op- 
portunities. Practical le- 




adership and manage- 
ment experience. And a 
monthly subsistence al- 
lowance of $100, for up to 
20 months during your 
last two years of college. 
"Army ROTC offers 
col lege sophomores the 
opportunity to earn an 
officer's commission in 
two years. But you must 



apply before April 1, then 
attend a six-week sum- 
mer Basic Camp, with 
pay. Approximately $500. 

"Do well and you 
qualify for the Army 
ROTC Advanced Course 
in the fall.
