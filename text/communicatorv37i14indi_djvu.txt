"Resisiance is futile. We will be as- 
similated!" When IPFW is filing new 
leehiiuloL'y. this is nut .1 bad thing. 

IPFW will be undergoing a Star 
Trek-like trans' formation over the win- 
ter break. Twenty -one classrooms will 
be renovated with new equipment; from 
projectors and DVD/VCRs to Dell flat 

"[We] started discussion early this 
year," said Joseph McCormick, man- 
ager of user technology support for 
information technology services. "[11 
visited several trade shows and spoke 
with universities Irani California to 
Florida to learn what types |uf technol- 
ogy are available]." 

Then, IT Services created Ihe 'per- 
fect' technology classroom, outfitted 
with what they felti 
dents could use mos 

"Simplify the 
support - intuitive is the key word." 
said McCormick. 

In order to test the new technology 
- and see if anything else was needed - 
IT Services sent two rounds of e-mails 
and a blitz of phone calls to a group of 
faculty at IPFW inviting them to check 
out Ihe new classroom equipment. 

Over the course of two weeks, about 
fifty instructors experimented with the 
equipment and attended an hour-long 
demonstration. 

Instructors were asked to give feed- 
back about the technology, which re- 
sulted in changes in the final setup. 

Final approval for the new equip- 
ment was given Nov. 9. If everything 
goes according to schedule. classrooms 
will be renovated from Dec. 18 to Jan. 
7. 

"The plan is to have the vendor 
install everything over the holiday 
break," said McCormick. 




Juecue Lehman and Phil Wittwer use technology to study for finals. 



According to the Department of 
Institutional Research. IPFW has 90 
classrooms. Of these. Sf) are general 
use classrooms - which means that they 
can accommodate projectors and other 
equipment. Only 38 of these class- 
rooms have 'fixed classroom technol- 
ogy.' such as a computer and projector 
permanently placed in the rooms. 

"We can't afford to redo all Ihe re- 
maining rooms,"' -aid McCormick. 

As a result, 21 rooms will be 
equipped u ith the new technology. 

"After (this) installation, the [em- 
plate will be in place and only 27 



(classrooms will be| left ol general use- 
to revamp, along with relrolitting the 
existing 38," he said. 

The 'training room' which holds 
the new technology is like ihe bridge of 
l lie knlcrpnse. Everything is contained 
in one unit — the Spectrum Lectern— a 
fixed, slate-gray desk that sits near the 
front of the room.' There will only be 
one cable attaching all the equipment 
from the desk to the wall. 

"What I really like is that it's clean," 
says McCormick, noting Ihe lack of 
messy power cords, remote controls 
and rolling carts. Speakers are installed 



in the walls, while the projector lias its 
usual perch in the ceiling. 

The lectern holds u DVD/VCR 
player underneath, with a control box 
and a computer lower. The keyboard 
is contained in a low drawer that folds 
open, complete with cushioned wrist 
pud. Tlie compute! on top, Dell model 
GX62D, has an upright Hal screen. A 
small black Hip-up panel on top of the 
desk reveals a 3,f&gt; inch toudipad/piisli- 
button screen, This is what controls all 
the machinery,

Alumni Honored During Homecoming Game 



Those who attended IPFW's Home- 
coming basketball game not only got 
the chance to see the men's team in 
action, but also had the opportunity to 
witness some of the university's most 
distinguished alumni being honored. 

On Nov. 19, during half time at the 
Memorial Coliseum, four alumni were 
recognized for their post-graduation 
contributions to both IPFW and the 

The Alumni Top Volunteer Award 
went to Jeff Taner, a 1982 graduate who 
studied business and accounting. 

Starting out as a college freshman. 
Taner had every intention to finish his 
degree at Indiana University in Bloom- 
ington. but things went so well in Fort 
Wayne that he decided lo stay put. 

Some 20 years later, Taner, the di- 
rector of audit and accounting services 
at Dulin. Ward &amp; DeWald, is an active 
member of IPFW's School of Business 
Alumni Council and the Alumni Asso- 
ciation's Advancement Team. 

Taner. who is also a Pacesetter tor 



the Alumni Annual Fund, said that he 
never expected to receive such a pres- 
tigious award. 

"I was very surprised when 1 re- 
ceived the news from Jennifer Bosk 
(director of alumni relations). I feel 
honored to have been selected," he 

Taner noted that he has been moti- 
vated to slay involved with the Alumni 
Association in part, because he is sur- 
rounded by IPFW alumni everyday. 

"We employ quite a few IPFW 
grads here al DWD," Taner explained. 
"That is our number one source for 
new hires. Our firm gives an account- 
ing scholarship each year and we also 
sponsnr ihe accounting society." 

It was from these links to IPFW 
that Taner was first invited 10 take part 
in Alumni Committees. From there, 
his participation progressed. 

"It has been a very positive expe- 
rience and I enjoy working with the 
people I have met through my involve- 

Taner was certainly not the only 
graduate whose efforts have garnered 
recognition. Because of his work with 
the Burmese community, Kyaw Joe 



Soc was presented v

Soc, a Burmese translator lor Fort 
Wayne Community Schools, is the 
founder of the Burmese children's 
preschool readiness program. He also 
serves as director of the Burmese Lit- 
eracy Program and is expected to be- 
come a member of the Yellow Ribbon 
Task Force lor Fort Wayne Community 
Schools. 

Kurt Heidenreich was the recipi- 
ent of the Bob F. Jesse Medal, which 
rewards Purdue graduates who provide 
unique and signihcanl contributions to 
IPFW. 

Now an architect with Engineering 
Resources, Inc.. Heidenreich designed 
the IPFW Willis Family Pedestrian 
Bridge and served as a structural and 
site designer for IPFW student hous-

Civil Engineering Professor Named President of Indiana's ASCE 



David Devine, associate professor of civil engi- 
neering technology, was recently named president 
of the Indiana section of the American Society of 
Civil Engineers. 

Devine, who joined the ASCE while he was in 
college, said he became a member because it was 
die only group at the time for students interested in 
civil engineering to join. 

"The American Society of Civil Engineers is 



the largest professional orgam/.iiion in the world," 
Devine said. 

The ASCE represents civil engineers in both 
the national and local scenes. These engineers have 
been called upon by the government to help in ur- 
gent situations, such as the 9/1 1 plane crash inlo the 
Pentagon. 

'There are committees that look into the de- 
tails of buildings and roads that civil engineers deal 
with. " Devine said. 

The ASCE has been around for 150 years and 
currenlly has over 140,000 members. The Indiana 
section is composed of 1,800 members. 



Devine said that being president of the ASCE 
has helped him make contacts with students and 
faculty members both around the area and around 

Devine spoke of how he has been lo a conference 
in South Korea and the national ASCE conference. 

Last year, Devine was the vice president of the 
Indiana section and says he is looking forward lo 
being involved this year. 

"It does involve a lot of work, bui it is nice 10 be 
recognized," Devine said.

know how the billions work," noted 
McConnick, pointing out the clearly la- 
beled bultons and brightly lit touchpad. 
Plug-ins hidden under the screen 
hold cables for laptops or a socket for 
a power cord. On the touchpad screen, 
brightly lit icons guide users in ma-

ihe s 



ton (blacks out the projector screen but 
leaves the desktop active as the instruc-

Help button. Once the Help button is 
depressed, .l message pops up at the help 
desk in IT Services. An ITS person can 
telephone ihe instructor using a number 
they input on screen, send a message to 
the instructor via ihe touch panel screen 
or send out a person to help. 



Because the Crestron touch screen is 
constantly wired 10 the ITS system, the 
Help Desk can identify problems with-

"It was truly acommiiicr uilk|je back when 1 attend-

Bypass High in reference to its location on Coliseum 
Boulevard. Now you have dorms and new buildings be-

It is no smalt miracle that the God of the universe was willing to leave heaven and be bom in a lowly, obscure 

stable in a Middle Eastern town. But perhaps an even greater wonder is that the same God is willing to come 

into the dirt and filth of our lives. Why? Tobring healing, lorgiv eness and wholeness. He's not waiting for you to 

clean up your stable or to make your life more acceptable to him. Just ask any of us how Jesus has changed our lives.

Gay Parenting: Provides Option for 
Neglected and Abused Children 



I honcslly do not understand the 
issue with homosexual parenting. I see 
the Conservatives' point-of-views, but 
Ihcy seem lo be forgetting the foremost 
subject: the child's welfare. 

Why are people so quick to judge a 
parental unit that jusi-so-happens to be 
a homosexual couple? 

Instantly, it's assumed that the par- 
ents are exposing their children to sa- 
distic, sexual rituals. 

Or, that the parents are "brainwash- 
ing" their kids, henceforth "forcing'" 
them to be gay. 

We're people, not monsters! We 
eat and sleep and work just like hetero- 
sexuals. We have feelings. We have

any homosexual couple? 

We all know that not every single- 
parent home is negligent or harmful to 
a child's well-being. 

On the contrary, in fact, I know 
several single mothers and lathers who 
arc performing their parental duties 
admirably. (I also know several of the 
opposite.) 



The point 1 am trying to make is 

this: if a child is healthy, happy, and 
llirivmu-why interfere'.' There's no 
excuse for it. 

Seeing as though I am not u parent, 
1 can not speak as such. That being 
said, however. I will say that I would 
assume that a homosexual couple 
would attempt lo raise their child in the 
most nonjudgmeniul home possible. 

1 know for a fact that thai will be 
my motto. And, I will not ostracize 
my kid if Ihey (GASP) turn out to be 
straight!

There is absolutely no justifiable 
reason to say that a lesbian or gay 
couple should not be parents. 

I understand that the child will 
probably be tormented, but everyone's 
life is made hellish by a bully at some 
point during their childhood. Whether 
the parents are gay or straight, imtorlu- 
nately.no child is immune. 



Comedian's Apology Falls 
Short of Public's Expections 



By Stephanie Samples 

As many of you may know, 

there has recently been a large 
amount of media attention di- 
rected towards Michael Rich- 
ards, otherwise known as Kramer 
from the popular television show 
"Seinfeld." 

If you didn't hear about this 
story, here is what happened: Mi- 
chael Richards was performing at 
a club in L.A and was heckled by 
an audience member. 

Richards then blew up and 
began using profanity and racist 
remarks against African Amcri- 

The video for this event was 
on television and available online 
from many Web sites. When I saw 
this video, I was shocked. 

I can understand Richards be- 
ing upset about his act being in- 
terrupted, but you don't perform 
at a club that serves alcohol where 
some of the audience members 
may be intoxicated and expect 
everyone to be polite. 

I never heard exactly what the 
audience member said to prompt 
the racist remarks, but Riehards's 
reaction was completely inap- 
propriate regardless of what was 

The day after the event was 
brought public, Michael Rich- 
ards appeared via satellite on the 
David Lettcrman Show during 
Letterman's interview with Jerry 
Seinfeld. 

Richards apologized and said 
that he wasn't a racist, but that he 
had just lost his temper. 

During his comments, the au- 
dience did not know how to react 
and some were laughing, which 
upset Richards. 

I don't find what R ichards said 
to be at all humorous; however. I 
do find his attempt at an apology 
amusing. 

Claiming that he is not a racist 
and that he didn't mean what he 
said is not an acceptable explana- 
tion for his behavior. 




Hi.s 



&gt; his i 



i be- 



havior makes u seem .is though 
he didn't think what he said was 
a very big deal, and that a sim- 
ple "I'm Sorry" would make the 
whole thing go away. 

This event made me think 
where the line is in comedy. Many 
different comics poke fun at oth- 
ers and themselves. 

Sometimes, the line ts unclear 
What one person finds funny may 



be extremely offensive to anoth- 

Numerous reporters on televi- 
sion were making remarks about 
how the situation surrounding 
R k hards s outburst would be 
taken much lighter if it were an 
African American comic making 
offensive remarks about a Cauca- 
sian person. 

I don't agree v. ith ihal because 
it is speaking too generally, if an 
African American comic made a 
comment about a Caucasian in his 
or her act, I don't think it would 
be offensive because the audience 
would be aware that it is a joke. 

On the other hand, it an African 
American comic had an outburst 
like Richards, I wouldTiope that 
the public would be just as of- 
fended. 

This controversy is not jusi 
about race; it is about having re- 
spect for other people. A perform- 
er should be thankful that there 
are people willing to pay to come 
see him or her. 

Even if the show doesn't go 
his or her way, he or she should 
know how to handle il. 

I am not necessarily a sup- 
porter of holding grudges, but 
when things like this happen, I 
feel thai it is somewhat necessary. 
In a country that should be grow- 
ing logether and trying lo break 
boundaries and walls between us, 
we should nol support entertain- 
ers who say such hurtful things. 
Although he may be sorry, a sim- 
ple apology should not 
be enough. 

If he truly thought what he 
said was inappropriate, he would 
not have said it in the first place. 

that we all may make some inap- 
propriate comments, bul a person 
needs to know how to control 
their self. 

If they don't, is sorry really 
good enough?

What is President 
Bush Thinking? 



By Curtis Nash 



What is George W. Bush thinking? 
While watching the images com- 
ing back from Iraq and seeing pa-si- 
deniial press conferences about the 
same, wondering what is going on in 
the commander-in-chief's mind is un- 
avoidable. It inspires inner conflicts, in 
one's mind, The duality of one's per- 
sonality emerges, and the inner debate 
Ines to explain away what one sees. 

What is he thinking? He is firm in 
Ins resolve lo "slay the course." 

Ah. a new buzz word: stay the 

Stay the course to do what? He 
gives an answer, but when asked lo tell 
someone else what lhat is, il sounds 
unclear. It is unclear because the 
course bus changed somewhat since 
ihe beginning of our invasion of Iraq, 

No one here was supportive of Sad 
dam Hussein's tie, ilinenl o| bis people, 
and no one approves of human suffer- 
ing and the repression of a person's 
right lo walk around doing whal he 
wants to do. However, thai is going 
on in many places, even places where 
there arc few American business m- 

huinongous reserves of oil-thc life- 
blood of our cullurc and ihe fuel for 



to respond to Srbcnica, and we did 
nothing lo prolcct Ihosc in Rwanda. 
We continue shirking Ihe responsibili- 
ties of Ihe Genocide Acl of 1948 by 
ignoring the evils being wrough! in 
Darfur. Iraq, and Armenia. The list 

Resolve is a good thing, no? The 
previous President was ridiculed for 

changing his mind according lo the 
will of public outcry. "Waffling" was 
ihe bUZZWOFd of the day during Presi- 
dent Clinton's tenure allhe helm of ihe 
country, especially when be undertook 
a humanitarian mission lo rescue the 
people of Somalia from those in power 
there. A President should nol waffle. 
He should "slay the course" and nol 

Another new buzz phrase: cut and 
run. Thai sounds like a bad thing. Il 
could be a big pan of what is keeping 
us in the Iraqi quagmirc-thc fact lhat 
we jusl know that our enemies will tell 
Ihe world thai they kicked our bulls 
out of Iraq. We are much too proud 
lo allow that. We are not chicken. We 
will nol "cut and run" like frightened 

And don't forget ihe price for Ihis 
resolve. We should know in this day 
and age thai, for the most part, wars 
are paid for with the blood of ihe poor 
and Ihe young. 

Arc you saying that ihosc in our 
military, along with their families, had 
no idea they might be in harm's way 
when they enlisted? Can they stand 
Up and be proud for serving, organize 
anti-war protests and sing John Len- 
non songs when this possibility oc- 

Don't go iherc-these people are 
huning. Does it make it any less 
wrong just because opposing Ihe cosis 
of war is an old argument? 

Besides, pointing out the worst of 
what has happened is ignoring the is- 

What could the President be think- 
ing? One has to assume that to draw 
oul the plan slep-by-step would un- 
cover the plan. He is an intelligent 
man and is advised by the most pow- 
erful minds in the country. There arc 
always naysayers. regardless of who is 
currently in the While House. Does he 
have lo spell out the reasons and the 
long-term goals of everything he does 
to anyone who questions him? Do we 
really need to know? 

We would like to know ihal there is 
a plan and that the reason for the plan 
is humanitarian in nature. Or perhaps 
lhat the plan is related lo hunling down 
Osama bin Laden and dragging him- 
as Hunter Thompson would have said- 
'by the bumper of a Buick through the 
streets of Washington.' 

Yes, a good image. But does he 
know what he is doing?

"College Republicans have helped 
lo change the course of history, and 
change it for the better." 
These are Ihc famous words from our 
country's 40th President, Ronald Wil- 
son Reagan, who arguably has gone 
down as one of the greatest presidents 
in our modem era. 

The College Republican National 
Committee (CRNC) is the country's 
oldest and largest youth political orga- 

Founded in 1892. the CRNC cur- 
rently has over a quarter of a million 
members throughout more than 1,800 
campuses nationwide. 
In the state of Indiana, Purdue, IU, 
Notre Dame, Ball State, Indiana Stale, 
Valparaiso, and IUPUI all have Col- 
lege Republican Chapters locafed on 
campus. This list goes on and on. 
Even the University of Southern Indi- 
ana has a College Republican chapter. 

But there is one campus in Indi- 
ana, that - as odd as it may sound - 
does not have a chapter for their stu- 
dents. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this 
campus we are referring lo is our very 
own IPFW. Luckily, in the next few 
months, all Republican Mastodons 
will once and for all have the opportu- 
nity to have their voice be heard. 

This chapter can only succeed with 
your help. This student organization, 
however, is not the lypical group lound 
on IPFW's campus. 

If enough people join, we may very 
well have big opportunities ahead of 
us which would include the opportu- 
nity to host well-known conservative 
speakers-not only speakers such as 
Seymour Hersh, Ralph Nader, Wolf 
Blit/er and Robert Kennedy Jr., who 
have in years past come to speak at 



IPFW and who all have liberal ideolo- 

Now, don't get us wrong. It has 
truly been an honor to have these 
speakers come to IPFW, and nol all of 
the speakers have had liberal ideology 
For instance, both Lynne Cheney and 
Bill Kristol have been two speakers on 
the conservative side of the spectrum 
who have spoken at IPFW. 

Nevertheless, the point is that by 
forming a College Republican Chap- 
ter here at IPFW. we will consistently 
have the opportunity lo host well- 
known conservatives from around the 
country, and you — as members of the 
College Republicans — may be able to 
meet them firsthand. Throughout the 
country. College Republican Chapters 
at various universities have held such 
speakers as Ann Coulter. Rick Santo- 
rum, Michael Reagan, and Sean Han- 
Yet, the College Republicans is 
much more than listening to featured 
speakers. As a matter of fact, accord- 
ing to our constitution, we would have 
four main goals as a student organiza- 

• To make known and promote the 
principles of (he Republican Party 
among members, the IPFW campus, 
and the surrounding communities 

• To aid in the election of Republi- 
can candidates in all levels of govcm- 

• To encourage and assist in ihe or- 
ganization and active functioning of 
the Republican Party at local, state, 
and national levels 

• To develop political skills and 
leadership abilities among Republican 
students as preparation for future ser- 
vice by them to the community 

Finally, it is very important to point 
out that we are not forming this group 
to criticize and ridicule the Demo- 
cratic Party. Instead, it is our goal to 



promote Republican ideals. 

This is not an anti-Democrat club, 
and everything we do will be done 
with the utmost respect to all differing 

As a matter of fact, both of us 
greatly respect much of the work 
done by many of our local Demo- 
crats including Graham Richard, Tim 
Pape, and Ben GiaQuinla, who have 
all provided tremendous leadership in 
strengthening our community. 

Wilh the highly-respected Profes- 
sor Andrew Downs as our advisor, it 
would be hard to imagine the club be- 
ing run any other way than with class 
and dignity. 

Together, the two of us invite all 
of you to join an organization that is 
long overdue in one of ihe most con- 
servative districts in our country. It is 
hard to believe that in a city like Fort 
Wayne, where College Republicans 
would be welcome with open arms, 
IPFW has yet to form such an organi- 

Not only would joining this orga- 
nization look great on your resume, 
help you get involved in the com- 
munity and on campus, and give you 
great opportunities to meet wonderful 
Republican leaders, but most impor- 
tantly, it is easy to join and will actu- 
ally be an enjoyable and eventful time. 
Let's do our best to do as Reagan said 

to change the course of history right 

here in our own backyard. 

Look for flyers wilh more informa- 
tion around campus in the very near 
future. For further information on join- 
ing College Republicans here at IPFW, 
contact Anthony Mitson by e-mail at 
mitsacOH" ipfw.edu or Adam Welch 
[ii vvekaj02(«ipfw.edu, and make sure 
to join ihe Facebook group "College 
Republicans (IPFW Chapter)" where 
we will be sharing information on an 
updated basis. 



Tis the Season for Grumpy People 



I work in the service industry, 
where I am forced to put on a smite 
and stay pleasant all the time. How- 
ever, doing this becomes quite diffi- 
cult considering some of the clientele 
I end up serving. 

Black Friday, the busiest shopping 
day of the year, wasn't too long ago. 
If you decided to make an attempt at 
shopping on this day, you were most 
likely pretty after pushing ihrough 
crowds and waiting in long lines. 

I know I was irritated, but I didn't 
take it out on perfect strangers who 
arc attempting to make your dining 
cspcrience enjoyable. 

On Black Friday, I had to serve 
grumpy people who had just spent a 
Ion of money on unnecessary Christ- 
mas gifts and were very stingy when 
it came to leaving my earnings. 



I don't think lis right calling them 
"lips." $2.13 isn't anything close lo 
what someone needs to live off of. and 
those "tips" are actually what I rely 

Don't even get me started on run- 
ning a server back and forth like cra/y 
for one item at a time. Drink your 
soda slightly slower and allow them 
to catch their breath instead of de- 
manding things right then and there. 
You don't really "need" the extra but- 
ter immediately. 

Besides dealing with grumpy peo- 
ple and their poor excuses of "tips." 
people are just plain rude during the 
holiday season. For example, trying 
to find a parking spot anywhere is 

There are people who will "sleal" 
parking spots even though they arc to- 
tally aware that the other person has 
their signal on. Or as a pedestrian try- 
ing to cross through the parking lot. 
drivers are so concerned with getting 
the close parking spot that they are 



ohiiv 






raining 

freezing rain and windy and that the 
pedestrian is waiting and wailing lo 
cross the road. 

Not only are strangers grumpy. 
sadly family is loo My mother, who 
is overwhelmed with shopping for 
everyone and coordinating all the 
Christmas get-togethers, is just get- 
ting crabbier by the minute. 

By the time Christmas morning ar- 
rives, everyone is so exhausted with 
all the preparations that the day is 
hardly joyous anymore. 









holiday season, stop and lake a mo- 
ment to think about our mood and de- 
meanor wilh other people. 

Let a chilly pedestrian cross the 
street before you zoom off to find 
your perfect parking spot. If you are 
in a restaurant, maybe you could smile 
and treat your server like a human be- 
ing, because they are giving up qual- 
ity family time so that you can dine 
out (with or without your family). 



Micro-Chipping Pets: Tracking 
Device is Invasion of Privacy 



The Chips that may aid 
in bringing your lost 
pets home, could be 
keeping tabs on you. 



Do you have a pet that was recent- 
ly adopted from an animal shelter? 
If you do it, was most likely micro- 
chipped. This is a 
new trend among shelters, so in case 
your little furbaby should ever get 
loose or something of that sort, jt can 
be identified and returned to you. 

But, some feel that this is an inva- 
sion of privacy. Putting a microchip 
inside of the animal hardly seems eth- 
ical. Granted, the pet can be safely re- 
lumed to you. but why does this have 
to be put inside its body? I believe 
this is why we pet owners get them 
collars and engraved tags with their 
name and our address on them. 




Also, the owner doesn't have a 
say in the matter This is a mandatory 
practice in order for the poor thing to 
be placed in its new home. 

In a sense, with this chip in our 
pets, we are being tracked. Mean- 
ing, if our pet is with us, we are being 
tracked too.

Marines Fight to Give Childhood 
Holiday Memories Since 1948 



By Brian Jones 

The Marines rarely ask for help 
The organisation, wlm.li prides iiselt 
on toughness, self-sacrifice, and its 
combat abilities, focuses on being 
able to accomplish almost anything 
on their own But around this time 
of year, the Marines do something 
that could almost be called 
uin.haracierisiic. They take up the 
fight to make sure every need&gt; child 
receives a gill this holiday season. 

"This is truly a great thing and 
I'm proud every lime I can be a part 
of it," said Cpl Joshua Fausnaugh. 
an IPFW student and Marine 
reservist serving wiih iJetaJinieiii 
One Communications Company in 
Peru, Indiana. 

The United States Marine Corps 
Reserve Toys for Tots program 
began in 1947 when Major Bill 
Hendricks and a group of Marine 
Reservists in Los Angeles collected 
and distributed 5,000 toys to needy 
children. 

The idea came from Bill's wife, 
Diane. In the fall of 1947, Diane 
handcrafted a Raggedy Ann doll 




anil asked Bill lo deliver the doll to 
an organisation whiih would give it 
lo a needy child ai Christmas When 
Bill determined that no agenev 
existed, Diane told Bill that he 
should start one. He did. The 1947 
pilot prn|ecl was so successful that 
I he Marine Corps adopted Toys for 
Tots in 1948 and expanded it into a 
nationwide campaign. 

"1 didn't join the Murine Corps 
with Toys for Tots in mind.' said 
Sergeant Brent Carlisle, a Ft. Wayne 

war in Iraq. "After seeing what 
this program is capable of, it's one 
of the things I'm most proud of 
when I look hack on my time in the 
Corps." 



Until 1979, the Marines collected 
ami distributed new and used toys. 
On Reserve drill weekends during 
October, November and December, 
Reserve Marines would relurbish 
used toys. However, since Christ mas 
ol l l )Sll the Marines have collecled 
and distributed only new toys. 

Three factors lead to this change. 
First, the Reserves were tasked with 
a greater role in national defense 
This caused Reservists to dedicate 
every minute of weekend drill time- 
to combat training and left no time 
tor the tradition ol refurbishing toys. 
Second, health and safety aspects of 
toys made the distribution of used 
toys legally inadvisable. Third, 
"hand me down" toys do not send 



the message Marines ivanl to send 
to needy children. 1 he goal ol the 
Toys for lots program is to deliver 
a message of hope. A shiny new toy 
is the best means of accomplishing 
this goal. 

Over the 57 years of the U.S. 
Marine Corps Reserve foys for Tots 
Program. Marines have distributed 
more than 332.5 million toys to 
1.SS.7 million needy children Tins 
charitable endeavor has made the 
U.S. Marines (he unchallenged 
leader in looking after needy 
children at Christmas. 

Over its 14-year lifespan, the 
Marine loys lor lots Jinmdalioii has 
supplemented local toy collections

holds a 3.5 GPA. 

"Chelsey is a very quick point guard 
who is a tremendous athlete. She has 
the ability to get to the basket, shoot (he

her ability to defend. She brings a lot of 
energy every time she's on the floor."

Air Force Grounds IPFW 



USAFA, CO - A local Colorado ra- 
dio station described today's Air Force- 
IPFW game as a "powdcr-pufF' contest 
for the Falcons. Air Force had just 
come off of a 94-58 blowout of ACC 
opponent Wake Forest, so what chance 
did Independent IPFW have? Appar- 
ently a good one, as the gritty 'Dons 
gave the Falcons everything they could 
handle before falling 78-66. 

It didn't appear that would be the 
case early in the game as Air Force 
took a 13-5 lead on an old-fashioned 
three-point play by senior forward Dan 
Nwaelele. 

However, the 'Dons would dig in. 
and after a three-pointer by sophomore 
guard Jakan Johnson and a triple from 
senior forward Justin Hawkins, IPFW 
grabbed a 21-20 lead with 7:50 left in 
the opening half. 

Air Force took their biggest lead 
in the first half on a three-ball from 
Nwaelele that made the score 32-23. but 
with under a minute left, the Mastodons 
got a layup from junior forward Jaruan 
Burrows and a pair of free-throws from 
junior forward Zcljko Lgcne to cut the 
AF lead to 34-29 at half. 

IPFW remained close throughout 
the entire second half. 

Atriple from Johnson pulled IPFW 



within two (49-47) at the 12:16 

Nwaelele hit Ins third Iroin behind 



niainmg, lo give AF an I I -point. 63-52 

The Mastodons mounted one linal 
charge. Junior forward DeWitt Scott 
knocked down a jumper at the 4:45 
mark to draw the 'Dons to within six 
(63-57). 

But, the Mastodons couldn't over- 
come the foul-shooting of Air Force (8- 






made 29 of 35 at- 
tempts from Ihe charity stripe. On the 
flip-side, IPFW attempted only five 
foul shots ihe enure game (2-5). 

Both teams shot very well in the 
contest. Air Force shot 59.5% (22-37), 
while the 'Dons shot 5 1 .0% (26-5 1 ). 

IPFW tried to overcome the lack of 
free-throws with three-pointers. IPFW 
hit 12 in the game, five coming from 
Johnson who led Ihe Mastodons with a 
career-high 19 poinis. 

Scolt was the only other "Don in 
double-figures with 15 poinis. 

Nwaelele led all scorers with 26 
points. Junior guard Tim Anderson 
scored 18 for the Airmen, while senior 
forward Jacob Bunschi added 14. 

With the loss. IPFW falls lo 3-5 
on the season. They are now 1-1 on 
the current three-game road trip which 
ends on Wednesday at Michigan Slaie. 
Game-time is 7:00p.m.
