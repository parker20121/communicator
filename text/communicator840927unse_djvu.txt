IPFW 

proposes 
new degree 
program 

By ANGEL* FRANCE 

Bunwrtiw 

A new degree program has been 
proposed lor IPFW by an induslrial 
advlaory commillee, consisling of 
pro lessors Irom the department of 
mo nulac luring technology ond leaders 
In ihc manufacturing Industry. 

Computer integrated ma nufac luring 
technology, or CIMT. may mean on 
additional 90 to 120 students per year lo 
D?FW. The program will provide op- 
portunities for those seeking em- 
ployment and those who are already 
employed in some area of manufac- 
turing to become proficient in computer 
aided design and computer aided 
manufacturing 

CAD-CAM programs are becoming 
Increasingly popular, even vital, in 
many areas of manufacturing 
technology Major automotive plants 
such as Ford and General Motors are 
requiring that their suppliers use it, and 
Fort Wayne's Dana Corporation in Fart 
Wayne implemented a CAD-CAM 
program Just last year. 

Jack Quinn. chairman of manufac- 
turing technology, a member of the 
Induslrial Advisory Committee, hopes 
and expccls that II will be approved. 

The proposal was submlllcd to the 
Purdue University Board of Trustees in 
West Lafayette a few weeks ago 

Quinn believes Una] word on the 
acceptance ol the plan should come 
within the next year. If approved, the 
degree program will most likely be 
implemented in the fall of 1986. 

Currently, IPFW's department of 
manufacturing technology alters three 
bachelor's and two associate's degrees.

IPFW 

looks at 
more than 
SAT tests 

By SANDY HARMEMNG 
Stolf Writer 

Admissions looks for three Ihings in 
incoming sludents, said Phil Kennell. 
director of admissions. 

Kennell said admissions look for the 
type of courses the student look in high 
school, the student's rank in class, and 
SAT scores. 

Bui SATs don't examine how well 
students have mastered subjects such 
as chemistry, Spanish, history or 
geography Educational reformers 
question the importance of SATs. 

"SATs are important." said James 
Bundschuh. dean of science and 
humanities. 'They're a good indicator 
ol the student's future." 

On the other hand, Julius Smulkstys, 
dean of arls and tellers, said, "SATs 
are important up lo a point, but they 
should be considered with olhcr factors, 
such as grades and evaluations from

Religion, politics mixing isn't new 



res peeling an establishment of religion, 
or prohibiting the Iree exercise thereof 

Since 1791 when these words were 
Included in the First Amendment lo the 
Constitution, lhe separation of church 
and stale has been a national policy. 
Even so, during different periods ol 
American history, religion and politics 
have been combined. With the 19*4 
presidential election now in full swing, 
this disputed Issue has again come to 
tight. 

Religion has at certain times in 
American history been an important 
factor in politics, said James Haw, 
chair of lhe history department The 
policy of separation of church and stale 
has developed gradually. 

In the colonial period, for example, 
most colonies had a state supported and 
funded church. Some of these states 
continued tax support of religion until 
Ihcenlury when the First 
was made applicable to 
vemmenls. Prior to that time 
idmentwas interpreted as only 







applying 
said Haw. 

Religion has cropped up as an Issue 
from time to time Id political cam- 
paigns as well. The 1850's Abolitionist 
movement, toughening Immigration 
laws in the last half of the 19th century 
and Prohibition in the IHO'a were all 
died by Haw as examples of political 
Issues with ties to religion. 

William Ludwin, associate professor 
of public and environmental affairs, 
said religious Input Into American 
public policy la "conspicuous In Its 
absence," Although this country began 



as a Christian nation, religious people 
and religion have not had a significant 
impacl In public policy except dh some 
specific issues, he said. 

He said religion Is at present a minor 
factor in the political process. Frank 
Codispoti, assistant professor ol 
political science, agrees. 

The focus on religion early In this 
presidential campaign will not con- 
tinue, Codispoti said, and did nol come 
about because of any specific desire by 
eilher party to bring the bume into the 
campaign. The candidates have cm 
phaaiied religion early in the campaign 
and will let the issue fade. 



Ronald Reagan, Codispoti said, w 
not make religion o central theme to 
his campaign because of the con- 
troversial nature of the Issue 

He said that although Reagan Is 
popular with younger voters, past 
surveys have indicated lhal younger 
voters generally are not In favor of 
Reagan's support of prayer In public 
schools or the banning of abortion. 
These two Issues are closely tied with 
religion In Reagan's platform. Instead 
of risking these potential voles. Reagan 
will probably not strongly emphasize 
religion in his bid for re-election, 
Codispoti said.

IPFW needs more vehicles for trans- 1 
porting students Involved in university 
[unctions, Bald the director of (he 
Indiana-Purdue Forensic League at 
Monday's meeting of the Fort Wayne 
Faculty Senate. 

Robert Adams, director of the 
Indiana -Purdue Forensic League, said 
he often has to ask his students to drive 
Lheir own cars to and from meets. 

John Camaghi, vice chancellor for 
financial affairs, said IPFW Is working 
on obtaining another van for the purpose 
of transporting students, 

Adams should never have to ask his 
students to drive their cars to and from 
meets. The Forensic League, through 
the success it has had at regional meets, 
promotes IPFW throughout the mid- 



The shortage of vehicles comes about 
when the athletic teams have to travel to 
away games on the same weekends the 
Forensic League travels to a meet. 

Both of these extra-curricular ac- 
tivities spread the IPFW name to places 
It wouldn't reach otherwise. Adams and 
the athletic department should have 
access to a van when It is needed. 

A request by the athletic department 
to purchase a 112,000 mini bus was 
denied a couple of years ago by Purdue 
University, Camaghi said. 

Maybe another request should be 
made. IPFW could point out the 
financial damage the university would 
suffer if a privately owned vehicle is 
involved in an accident on the way to or 
from a speech meet.

Cubs end drought 



Monday night, the Chicago Cubs ended 
baseball's longest drought when they 
beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-1 lo clinch 
the National League East Division. It 
was the Cubs' first championship of any 
kind since 1945 when they won the 
National League pennant. 

With the Cubs winning, it marked two 
teams with a large following of fans in 
the Fort Wayne area winning two of 
baseball's lour divisions. A week ago, 
the Detroit Tigers clinched the 
American League East Division. 

The Cubs and Tigers have given 
baseball fans a lot lo cheer about this 

The Tigers started the season by 
winning 35 of their first 40 games and 
remained in first place from the first day 
of the season until the last. Included in 
that stretch was a no-hitter pitched by 
Jack Morris. It was the first no-hitter 
thrown by a Detroit pitcher since 1956. 

The Cubs didn't start nearly as fast. 
They didn't take over first place for good 



until August. The Cubs still provided 
many outstanding moments though. The 
most memorable was probably the day 
when Ryne Sandberg twice hit game- 
tying homers against the St. Louis 
Cardinals lo salvage a Cub victory. 

Fort Wayne fans may have s 
to cheer about, especially if the Cubs and 
Tigers meet in Ihe World Series. It would 
be a rematch of the 1945 Series, won by 
Detroit. 

The 1984 Series would also give 
baseball purists something to cheer 
about Tiger Stadium, home of the 
Tigers, and Wrigley Field, home of the 
Cubs, are old-fashioned stadiums. Fans 
in those two parks feel as Ihough they 
can reach oul and touch the players 
Both parks have grass fields and a 
unique personality. Wrigley Field has no 
lights, meaning the Cubs play all of their 
home games during the day. 

Baseball will surely benefit by a Tiger- 
Cub World Series.

IPFW recruits 
28 new faculty 

By JENNIFER AC K LEY 

"Mew faculty bring new Ideas and create excitement and 
interest. " said Edward A. Nicholson, acting chancellor 
IPFW has 28 new lull-time [acuity members this fall. 

But how did IPFW. who oflcrs a pay scale comparable Id 
Indiana University and Purdue University — Ihe two lowest 
paying institutions In Ihe Big Ten — attract Inls large 
number? The answer Is recruitment. 

An extensive effort was made to attract the most effective 
educators by drawing upon Ihe attributes of IPFW. Olfering 
a midwest location, IPFW employs many natives of Ihe mid- 

friends, these rccmi Is make up a majority ol the new faculty 



"Above all, the emphasis on our campus Is primarily upon 
leaching Instead of research," said Nicholson. He added that 
fPFW offers well-equipped labs and physical fuel lit lea, In 
addition to friendly and compatible prospective colleagues. 

Each division is responsible lor recruitment, with hiring 
based upon the division chairman's recommendations. Tills 
year, an aggressive elforl was also made by John P. Ulmer. 
dean of student services, to attract minority faculty, 
especially black recruits. By visiting 17 colleges and 
universities throughout the midwest and south, some success 
was achieved by (he hiring ol two minority faculty members 
in the departments of education and engineering. 

Paying special attention lo compohlile research Intercsla 
and course strengths. IPFW looks for skillful teachers. 
Previous experience and graduate work by prospective 
employees enable each division to screen its applicants and 
hire only Ihe most qualified. Nicholson said.

By DAVESCHWilHElt 

Staff Writer 
The Civic Theater started 
its 1984-aS season with Ihe 
musical "George M," and 
the excellent cast headed by 
Larry Life helped make 
"George U" Ihe best per- 
formance at the Fort Wayne 
Civic Theatre in two years. 

The musical presented 
some of Iheups and downs of 
George M. Cohan's career 
starting with his blrih and 
ending with his not fitting 
into Broadway anymore. All

bumps and a chill down my 
spine when I heard "Give My
