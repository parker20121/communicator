Anthropological perspective given on terrorist attacks 

Professor Sandstrom stresses the need for improved foreign policy in United States 

By Star Nelson 
News Edilor 



"It's a terrifying lime lobe 
alive," began prolessoi Alan 
Sandslrom. director o( IPfW's 
anthropology program, as he 
led oft this year^ Luncheon 
Lechjre series last Wednesday. 

Sandslrom's lecture was 
cntilled "An Anthropological 
Perspective on September lllh: 
Clasii of Civilizations." The lec- 
ture was given lo an ovcrflow- 
i who listened raplly 



causes behind the terrorist 
Sandslrom went on lo pro- 
anthropological observations 
he had made while conducting 
lieldivork in Mexico. 

He noted that a tribe of 
rulive Indians, who had lived 
in Mexico since prehistoric 
times, had managed lo survive 
and retain a cultural identity, 
despite the fad that they had 
t&gt;een dominated by Spaniards 
and that 95 percent of their 
population was wiped out in 
the TiTsl ci^hl lo 10 years after 
they were mvaded. 

The tribe mointains its 
identity through dress, which is 
actually a 16th centurj- Spanish 
clothmg style. Sandslrom relat- 
ed ttiis story as an example of 
Ihe power and tenacity of cul- 
tural identity, whether it is 
legitimate or nol. 



Cultural identities, not 
international borders, consti- 
tute the contemporary dividers 
of peoples, according to 
Sandslrom. "Culture is always 
defined in opposition lo some- 
thing. It is constantly being cre- 
ated and re-created. Culture is 
actively and cotwtanllv crealed 
by people to identify Ihem- 
selves and defend themselves." 
Sandslrom explained. 

Sandslrom then offered 
three divergent lines oi anthro- 
pological thought as a back- 
drop lo his exploration of the 
anthropological issues behind 
the September attack last year. 
He continued his discussion 
with a brief history of anthro- 
pology, ^vhich was founded as 
a fieltf in Ihe 19lh cenlur)'. 

Contemporary culhjre as 
tve know it ivas born in France 
during (he Enlightenment pen- 
od. The cultural ideals, then 
knoivn as 'civilizocion,' which 
sprang from that period would 
today be referred to as global- 
ization, an idea obviously 
embraced by the Uniled Stales 
government, beginning with 
Reagan and Bush and their. 
"One World Onter." 

An opposing cultural 
view, known as 'Kultur' was 
developed m response in 
Germany, which today, in ils 
most radical form, might 
equate lo fundamentalism. 

"Fundamentalism is a 
world-wide movement, not just 
a VS. problem. It is essentially 



anti-modernism, anfi-global- 
ization," Sandstrom said. 

Fundamentalism has been 
used by some, who are tired of 
iking orders and being told 



A'hal t 



belie' 






establish individuality. 

Osama bin Laden is an 
example of a leader whose fol- 
lowers see him as reluming 
Ihem to more fundamental reli- 
gious values, hfe is. in a sense, 
giving them a cultural individ- 
uality, a set of social values lo 
base I heir behaviors on. 

Bin Laden is only a figure- 
head for the movemcnl, identi- 
fied and singled out by the 
Uniled States govemmenl as a 
target- Deslnaying bin Laden is 
a (utile act though, according to 
Sandslrom. 

"Go ahead and pick off 
individual leaders. There will 
always be other people lo lake 
their places," he added. 

Our ignorance of the sig- 
ruficance of these cultural iden- 
tities and their relevance is 
slarting to cost us. Sandstrom 
offers two suggestions for the 
United Slates govemmenl to 
help alleviate the ever-looming 
terrorist threat which hangs 
over Ihe head of Ihe nation. 

• First, take care of the 
immediate threat through intel- 
ligence gathering, security 
measures and working to 
secure our present well-being. 

■ Second, the Uniled 
Slates needs a belter foreign 
policy. We don't focus enough 



on it. Uniled States foreign pol- 
icy IS planned around each 
E residential election cycle, in 
)ur year increments, we need 
lo Ihink in terms of a 50-ycar 
foreign policy plan. 

According lo Sandslrom, 
we musl also use methods 
accumulated by applied 
anthropology to ease economi- 
cally disadvantaged nations 
into gaining economic stability 
and independence. "We share 
responsibility for (he economic 
misery of Ihe world," 
Sandslrom said. The Uniled 
Slates also has Ihe inlelleclual 
and economic capacity (o alle- 
viate thai misery. 

Sandstrom believes that 
educated thinkers, like those 

come up wilh altemalivcs lo 
globali/alion and fundamental- 
ism and work an Uniled States 
foreign policy problems. 
Additionally. he warned 
against America-bashing, 
despite whatever shortcomings 
Ihis nation may have. 

"We are acting like a world 

Eower. like many throughout 
istory, but we need lobe belter 
than that. We are belter Ihan 
that," Sandstrom concluded. 

Chancellor Michael Wartell 
will present Ihe next lecture in 
the scries on Sept. 18. His pres- 
enlalion, "Ilic Univeisity Today," 
will be held in Ketller G46. Free 
pizza will be provided by 
Student Government.

Mars Asks:

mbcr&lt; 



Females are allowed lo plav 
the course — they just can t 
be members. 

Now I'm not sexist at 
all, but this is no noble cause. 
This is nol Rosa Parks refus- 

bus. In fact, this is more com- 

E arable to Daria from the 
ittle Rascals trying to be a 
member of the gang! 
Sometimes guys just need to 
hang oul with other guys! 
We jusl need to get away! 

Why. aJicr all o( these

National allow female mem- 
bers? H's not as i( there aren't 
female&lt;on]y clubs. And, I 
don't see any women healing 



down Ihe doors lo join the 
Hairclub for Men. 

As of now. the pec^le who 
run Augusla National have 
stood Uieir ground, despite tlie 
pressure from the media, spon- 
sors and vanous oUiCT groups. 
And 1 say to them, "Stay stronjj

And to anyone who 
believes thai women should 
be allowed as members, 1 
ask, "WHY? " I promise thai 
if you want to start your own 
club for women only, we'll 
leave you alone. 

In closing, I'd just like to 
ask one more thing: Where's 
it going to slop? Pretty soon 
people who can't golf are 
going to demand and get

I'm all lor equality, but 
It seems Ihe ivotld has

Versatile punk album far from 'Limited' 



In » year when so-called 
punk music is popping out of 
ihc woodwork. It's refreshing lo 
hear a new group iKal doesn'l 
complelety copy off of Ihe MTV 
mjinslays. Never Heard Of [I 
gets Ihe |ob done on their fourth 
album. "Limited Edition." A 
sclf-d escribed mix of New 
Found Glory and Good 
Charlotte, NHOI lampeis with 
several different sounds on their 
album. From Ihc mean'spirited 
"Veronica" to Ihe seemingly 
melodic "The Escape," NHOI 
keeps the listener interested

will appeal to nearly any crowd. 
NHOI hits ha(d with the 
album's first song "Alone." 
"Alone" will aUo be the first sin- 
gle and video from the album. 
^Alonc" exhibits NHOI's good- 
nalured punk roots with a 
Strang New Found Glory-lype 
sound without all oF the over- 
done hype. The nexl three 
songs — "Waste of Time," 
"Where Am 1" and "She's 
Over It" — all keep Ihe string of 
pop/ punk strong. 

For those of you who are 
ihinking thai NHOI brings the 
same walcred down pop/punk 
of Dlink 182, you are mistaken. 



NHOI jam-packs each Irack 
with hard-hitting guitar riffs 
and vocals thai will leave you 
reeling for days lo come. The 
group stops mid-album to show 
thai Ihey can shil have fun with 
their work as Ihey cover Ihc 
classic Foundations track, 
"Build Me Up." Bui, don't think 
their cover is clean-cut doo-wop. 
NHOI's Johnny Bnltain slill hits 
hard with serious blasts from his 
powerhil bass. 

NHOI leafs oul yel again 
with an unbelievable melody for 
"The Escape." Vocal isl DJ 
Dell'Osa belts oul some ot the 
best cords by a rock singer.

An added treat is in store 
for all of you album owners one

track is a must hear. The track,

affects of tequila, is the perfect 
ending to the most diverse punk

New perspectives to sci-fi and fantasy 



"Mists of Avalon" 

Not loo long ago, I caught a 
rc-run of Ihe TNT movie "Misis 
of Avalon," which was based on 
the book of the same name by 
Marion Zimmer Bradley 

It looked pretty neal. I've 
always liked Arthurian legend, 
and the twisi of having it told 
from Ihe perspective of Ihe 
female characlers was quite inter- 
esting. So, I went oul and read 
the book, and I'm so glad I did. 

The characters were incredi- 
bly well thought out. Through 
Ihe eyes of Morgaine (also 
known as Morgan Ip Fey), 
Cuenhv-vier, Vivianc (the Lady of 
Ihe Lake) and other supporting 
women. Ihe story of the rise and 
fall of Camclot is told. 

The story begins before 
Arthur is bom and tells the story 
of his enchanted birlh. II tells the 
previously untold tale of Avalon 
and ils secrets, including the 
fac luring of Excalibur and 
the position of Merlin. 

Bradley did her homework 
well and many of the historical 
relcrences are based "" --- -' 
finding — rot all, of ■ 



many. By the end, there arc new, 
younger characters taking over 
the roles of the now older, more 
jaded characters who started oul, 
1 love the way she presents 
the large amount of hmc thai 
passes and Ihe changes ii brings. 
All in all, 1 would certainly rec- 
ommend this book to anyone 
who likes King Arthur stones 
and likes fresh new perspectives 
on classic material. 

"Stranger in a Strange Land" 

Another book that has been 
r reading lisl for ; 



raised into adulthood by acivdiza- 
tion on Mars. When he is fiiully 
discovered and broughl back to 
Eailh, the real story begins. 

Mike is basically a human 
who knows nothing abotit what 
Ihe rest ol us humans think it 
means lo be human. He has no 
concept of money or greed or 

objects with his mind. 

His discovery of religion 
makes a great ' 



5 him 



a schoo 



:nda- 



long time (at the 
lion of a close friend) is "Stranger 
in a Strange Land" by Robert 
Heinlein. 1 finally got around lo 
reading Heinlein 's classic Sci-Fi 
case study of humanity, and 1 
think I'll be reading it again soon. 

The book is set in the lale 
pari of Ihe 20th century', but ivas 
actually written in Ihe early 
1900s. So, there are flying cars, 
but there is no such thing as 
AIDS; the whole world is run by 
one government, bul baseball is 
slill USA's national pastime. 

Although my lavorile char- 
acter is Jubal, the main protagonist 
is Michael Valentine Smith, who 
has an exh:3ordinary birth and is 



tcacholhers how lo use their latent 
"superhuman" poivers. Above 
and beyond the plot of the story 
lies the intuitive observatioiu. 

Heinlein talks about ethno' 
cenlrism. sexism, religion, caruii- 
balism and many other social 
problems humans deal wilh. 1 
recommend the uncut version 
over the shorter one because it 
gives each of Ihc characters a 

' distinct flavor.

It. The international invasion of Iht' 
NBA has begun. Is 11 a slep in the

quick fix for a sporl that is losing 
more fans each year? 

For some reason. Stem and the 
frotil office leadeis dcdde Ihe NBA need-

Canada. IVhile the Toronto Raptors 
have taken a step in Ihe right diicc- 
lion, the Vancouver CiTTzlics were 
an embarrassment to the sport. 

But what can the Toronto 
Raptors base their success on? They 
can base a good portion of Ihcir suc- 
cess on Vince Carter, a man ivho is

" — ylhing. the re( 
oreign players 
s ol a handful of players 
m the NBA. Howei'er. for ever)' 
Dirk Nowilski. Steve Nash, Peja 
Stojakovic and Vlade Divac, there 
are dozens of players on the grand 
stage that is the NBA who are 
mediocre at best. 

For example, players such as Totu 
Kukoc. Dino Radp, Zhi Zhi VVang and 
Tony Parker an;all-slars in their home- 
lands, but in Uie NBA, they arc no 
more than middlc-dass players. 

So why do people like Stern 
think that intemalional players are 
going lo have more of an impact 
than before? Because out of every 
doien players irom overseas, one of 
them can stand on his oivn tivo feel 
in the NBA. - - 

It's Ihe same song and dance 



over and over again. The New York 
Knicks Ined it in 1999. They wasted 
the 15th pick in the draft on the 
Fiench-bom Frederic Weis, passing 
up top players Ron Arlest and 
Ctvean George in the process. 

And those are just two of the 
players. Thiitecn of the 14 players 
selected in the first round after Weis 
have gone on lo play in the NBA, 
something Weis has yet to do. 

The phenomenon of foreign 
players is paralleled only by iKe 
phenomenon of high school stand- 
outs skipping college to cam a buck. 

Based rai the success of Tracy 
McGrady, Kotie Bryant and Kevin 
Camett, a record se\'en high school play- 
ers dccJarcd themselves eligible for tnc 
aMl draft looking for lame and fortune. 

Here's a reality check; only five 
of them were drafted, ordy four in 
Ihe first round, only one of Ihem 
started any games and none of Ihem 
had any valuable playing lime, 

Draftmg high school stars vias 
thought to be a quick fix for several 
years. Guess what — those coaches 
andgeneral managers were woBng. 

So what will make Ihe quick fix 
usineforcign players any different? 

The first NBA drafl occurred in 
1957. Only eight players were 
selected. II wasn't until 1986 that a 
foreign player was selected in the 
first round of a drafl, and it wasn't 
unlil 1994 when that man, Ar\'ydas 
Sabonis, made his NBA debut. 

In 2IMI, only four foreign players 
were selected in the firel round. What 
a change to 2002, when only si&gt; were 
drafted in the first round, but eight 
I'lected in round ' 



it may have been some? 
sign that 

ling better and could outplay 
American players. 

But wait, wasn't Ihat Argentina 
game the first loss by America in 
men's baskelball in intemation.il 
play since pro players began play- 
ing in 1992? 

A span of 10 years ivent by for 
Team USA with a record of 53-0. So 
what's the big deal? Who else can 
say Ihey were undefeated for 10 
years? Who else has won every 
Olympic, World Basketball 
Championship and Goodwill 
Games gold medal for 10 years? 

Not a single country can claim 
that, cicept for Ihe United Slates. 

So does this spell Ihe end for 
American domination? No, but a 
good deal of sports writers think so. 

ESPN.com writer Chad Ford 
even went as far as to say thai "bas- 
ketball will never be the same again." 

This guy must be off his rocker. 



What 






s the 



What 



)uld coaches and gi 



gener- 

il managers be thinking? While 
standout college players like Juan 
Dixon and Oan Dickau ivaited unlil 
late in Ihe hrsl round lo hear their 
names called, unknowns like 
Nikolox Tskitishvili and Nene 
Flilario were lottery picks. 

For those in favor of the inter- 
national invasion, Sept. 4 and 5 
were probably great days. On those 
days, a quick Argentina squad and a 
delermined Yugoslavian team 
handed Team USA back-lo-back 
OjScts^'Tmht: World-flasktiball 
Championships. 



Team USA has just begun." The 
Dream Team is sllll very much alive. 
Is it a bump in the roacl? Sure. But is 
it a bad thing thai the USA lost? No, 
it's a good thing. 

Not a single player on that 
leam wanted lo be the one to end 
Ihe streak of victories. For the past
