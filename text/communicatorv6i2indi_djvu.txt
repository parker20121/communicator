I.U.'s 'palace revolution' 

The Willbern Reporl is finally public, most ol its recommendations are now

Oh, yes. We forgot to mention Dial the family ,iml students ,uc upset again. It 

is admirable that President Ryan could accomplish so much in so little time. 

Ryan's talk about continuous evaluation not withstanding, the I.U. 

.idminislr.itive changes were sucjrslcd by the Willbern Report with only one or 
two exceptions The Willbern Task Force consisted nl ;i number of high level I.U. 
officials - three of which are now even higher level I.U officials-- who were 
charged with studvini: the administrative structure of I.U. The report was kept 



already been made Thai story is eel line, so old you would I hull; I bal we would be 
used to il by now. Evidently Prestdenl Ryan had hopes in thai direction. 

The reporl was never subjected In public scrutiny until it was too late to do 
anything about il This caused Vice President Liebenow lo quit. He probably 
would have fouled things up anyway. 

The Willbern Reporl ignored the iccjimal campuses, most likely considering 
them necessarily evils that get in the way of the granduer of the 
Bloominglon- Indianapolis axis To his credit. President Ryan gave Ihe regional 
campuses a somewhat higher prionl v in the fmal reorganization lie also rejected 
the proposal that Purdue be kicked out of the Indianapolis campus. 

The reorganization is little more than a feeble attempt to prevent IU-PU from 
going independent Ryan hopes ihat merging the administrations and academic 
schools of the Bloomioglon .iod Indianapolis campuses will link the tow 
inseparably. 

There was a lot of talk about economy and weakening the bureaucracy. It 
speaks for itself that I.U. now has more vice presidents than Purdue, a university 
that takes pride in its bureaucracy
