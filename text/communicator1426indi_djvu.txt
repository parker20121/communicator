The IPFW faculty Mimic has voted lo

It's not easy being a guinea pig and 62 year-old Barney

Unfortunately, Clark's other organs gave out, and he died 
March Z3. The Jarvtk-T heart, however, still beat when 
Clark' a circulatory system collapsed. 

The man-made heart gave Clark 112 eilra days of life. and.

managed to rise above the

for this category Is Ben
