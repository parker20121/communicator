INDIANA - PURDUE COMMUNICATOR 



Broyles, Manges like it 

Heads agree with 
'super-chance/lor' 
unification plan 



Bj TIM DUCEY 

The future governance of Indi- 
ana-Purdue University moved sever- 
al steps closer to a "super-adminis- 
trator" this week, as both the 
Chancellor of Indiana and the Dean of 
Purdue, in separate interviews, 
advocated the creation of such a post. 

Ralph E. Broyles, chancellor of 
Indiana, and Roger J. Manges, dean 
and director of Purdue, expressed 
their views for the students and 
faculty at the local campus, to 
clarify their position on governance 
following the release several weeks 
ago of the Keenan Report tothe 
Indiana Commission on Higher Edu- 
cation. 

Brock Able.student body presi- 
dent at Indiana-Purdue, issued a plan 
last week favoring the creation of a 
"super-administrator." When asked 
about the Able plan , Chancellor 
Broyles said, "Several years ago, I 
think three or four, I was under the 
impression that that was exactly what 
was going to be the future here, of this 
particular campus— a person who 
would unify the administrative struc- 

Dean Manges had this comment 
about a single administrative head: 
"I've maintained for some time now 
that this institution could not have 
reached the degree of quality, nor had 
its present impact as soon as it did 
have, without both Indiana and 
Purdue. When you join two institu- 
tions which academically comple- 
ment each. other as do Indiana and 
Purdue, one would expect quality." 

Manges continued, "On the other 



the administrative functions have 
been unified, I strongly believe we've 
reached the point in time when some 
form of administrative amalgama- 
tion would set the stage for our next 
period of growth. I see no other 
alternative, quite frankly, than a 
single individual, be he called a 
"super-chancellor," or what, be 
appointed with the responsibility, 
therefore, of 'getting it all together.' ' ' 
Both administrators agreed that, 
although the decision to proceed in the 
direction of a single administration 
head would have to come fro the 
offices of presidents of both universi- 
ties, the Fort Wayne Campus should 
have a voice in the selection of such a 
person. 



Chancellor Broyles mentioned 
that the Indiana Faculty Senate had 
already deliberated about the possi- 
ble formation of a committee, and had 
drawn up a list of 14 persons to be 
considered as faculty representa- 



; should be included on 
such a committee, but Chancellor 
Broyles qualified his position on 
student representation by saying he 
did not feel the committee make-up 
should include equal student repre- 
sentation. He said, "Since this 
committee would ultimately report to 
both institutions, the ultimate deci- 
sion would have to be made by the 
boards of both institutions. Recom- 
mendations could certainly be made 
to those boards by committees that 
are made up of constituencies. That 
would involve, as I see it, faculty, 
students, and alumni." 

Broyles disagreed with theAble 
plan at this point, mentioning that he 
did not feel that students should be 
represented on an equal basis with 
faculty. The Chancellor said, "The 
student representation is, in a sense, 
somewhat transient. People who are 
here now are not going to be here 
maybe next year, or two years from 
now." Broyles added that he feels the 
faculty, due to their more permanent 
status and experience, would have 
more knowledge at their fingertips in 
selecting a person to head the 
university. 

Dean Manges, expressing his 
desire that the campus have a voice in 
the selection process, said, "I would 
hope that whoever is selected, that the 
agreement to select be just that; and 
that any kind of further unification 
emanate from within the institution, 
and not be super-imposed from 
outside." 

Manges, in considering whether 
students should be represented on a 
"search and select" committee, said, 
"Absolutely, there should be input by 
the students. Obviously, the decision 
(about student representation) will 
have to be made out of both 
presidents' offices, but I would be 
very surprised, frankly, if there were 
not students on the committee. I 
certainly support it, and, at every 
opportunity, will make that point." 

The Keenan Report propoed 
complete independence for the Fort 
Wayne Campus as the most favorable 
alternative for future governance. 




Both Chancellor Broyles and Dean 
Manges disagreed with the idea of 
independence at this time. Dean 
Manges said, "If we look at the 
Keenan Report, where he talks about 
it (independi

and with certain 

thin the state, I 

would suggest 



with Professor Keenan. He said, 
doesn't seem sensible to me, really. I 
know that a number of faculty that we 
were successful in bringing into the 
institution, came because it was 
Indiana University, or because it was 
Purdue University. I would, quite 
frankly, feel that if this coming 
legislature would mandate complete 
autonomy for this campus, we would 
be set back-how many years I have 

The Chancellor then listed a 
number of problems that would be 
created by independence; including 
difficulties in obtaining operating 
funds, the hiring and housing of a 
records-processing staff, the difficul- 
ties in keeping permanent student 
records, and the possible loss of fringe 
benefits that the faculty and staff 
would encounter, such as new 
contracts for insurance. Broyles also 
mentioned the fact that the campus 
simply doesn't have the physical 
facilities at present to support 
independence. 



The Able plan outlined a call for 
unification of the faculty into one 
body, rather than two separate 
entities. Both administrators, when 
asked abut that aspect, felt that this 
qustion should be addressed by the 
faculty themselves and was a bit 
premature to discuss at this point.

JPAC studies reduced 
parking fee schedule; 
to vote in 2 weeks 



By TIM DUCEY 

Two important actions were 
taken at the Joint Parking and Traffic 
Advisory Committee meeting held 
-Wednesday, October 31. 

A critical recommendation was 
made to consider a drastic reduction 

parking fees starting with the 






1974-75 school year. The recommend- 
ation was made to consider 
structure of $40 per year for "A" 
stickers and $4 per year for"B' 
stickers. A further alternative sug- 
gested at the meeting was the ! Folk representing students, made 



The suggestion was made by a 
JPAC sub-committee, formed last 
month for the express purose of 
seeking viable alternatives to the 
present fee structure, which is $60 per 
year for "A" stickers, and $25 per 
year for "B" stickers.

Thomas K. Scott, with Dr. James 
Berry representing faculty, and Mike 



Soccer players to receive awards 



Athletic committee suspends 
NCAA requirements 



ByT 



If FRANKE 



This Joint Athletic Committee 
decided to suspend the rules of 
eligibility that caused the Indiana- 
Purdue soccer team to forgeit all 
their wins and ties of the 1973-74 
season in order to present varsity 
awards to the players for this year's 
participation in soccer. 

The committee made this decis- 
ion because three soccer team 
members played most of the season 
before they were told by the 
committee that they were ineligible. 

The decision was reached in a 
meeting of the committee on Tues- 
day, October 30, 1973, with several 
members of the soccer team in 
attendance. Player Vince Lochbihler 
and Coach Andy Johns voiced their 
opinions on the soccer controversy. 
Both Lochbihler and Johns felt that 
soccer should remain a varsity sport. 
Lochbihlvr wants to promote soccer 
by visiting high schools and acquaint- 
ing the athletes with the soccer 
program here. 

Johns feels that involvement in 
soccer is low because Indiana-Purdue 
is a commuter campus and the 
players all have part-time jobs. He 
added, however, that soccer is an 
important addition to the athletic 
offerings at this campus. 

No decision was made regarding 
the future of soccer as a varsity sport. 

In other action, the committee 
decided to suspend the eligibility rule 
concerning number of hours complet- 
ed during terms attended until the 
rule could be investigated. A sub- 
committee to study the eligibility 
requirements was named. 

The continual disappearance of 
athletic equipment was an important 
topic of discussion at the committee 
meeting. Johns noted that 15 of 20 



recently purchased soccer uniforms 
are missing. 

The committee discussed the 
possibility of hiring a super-manager 
to be in charge of all equipment used 
in the athletic programs. Jim 
Bolinger, directed of student activit- 
ies, was asked by Ed Leonard, 
chairman of JAC, to investigate and 



super-manager. 

Leonard appointed a committee 
to promote the athletic program on 
campus, a committee to analyze the 
intramural program, and a commit- 
tee to analyze the inter-collegiate 
program. 

The Students' Government repre- 
sentative said that the government 
would also appoint committees to look 
into the athletic programs.

their recommendation after consider- 
ing the future needs of the campus 
concerning parking, including the 
.paving of all "B" lots, the considera- 
tion of a projected addition of two new 
lots totaling 500 spaces, the adequate 
lighting of all lots, and the nuiini.-mi 
ence of a cash balance in the parking 
fund to meet future possible expenses. 

The sub-committee report was 
greeted enthusiastically by the full 
committee, and is expected to be 
well-received by anyone now paying 
the present high fees, 

The committee, in seeking sup- 
port for the recommendation to 
reduce the fee, moved unanimously to 
conduct a poll through the campus 
newspaper, the Communicator. The 
poll will ask for pertinent data from 
persons who now hold "A" or "B" 
stickers, either full or part-time, and 
will be published in the November 8 
' " s campus paper. 



buildings, to deposit returning ballots. 
The committee pleaded for faculty 
and students to make a point of filling 
in and returning these ballots, since 
their decision will rest on the 
enthusiasm with which the new fees 
are received. More information will 
accompany the ballot in next week's 
Communicator. 

The committee also moved to 
create two free slots immediately in 
front of the Day-care center, so that 
parents dropping off or picking up 
children will have free and easy 
access to the center in inclement 
weather. This proposal is expected to 
be initiated immediately. 

The 2-slot area will be marked 
with a sign emphasizing "For 
Day-care center only," and will be 
limited to 5-minute parking. The 
effectiveness of this service to 
parents will be evaluated at a later

Speaking 



NCAA and IU- PU 



The last two or three weeks have witnessed a controversy over the 
athletic programs at IU-PU. More specifically, the eligibility of three 
soccer players and one cross-country runner has caused severe 
repercussions among the members of the teams, the Joint Athletic 
Advisory Committee, the Student Senate, and others. 

The controversy centers on the question of whether IU-PU athletics 
should be governed by the rules of the National Collegiate Athletic 
Association (NCAA). Incidentally, IU-PU is not at present a member of 
the NCAA, nor has it applied for membership. 

At present the NCAA rules regarding eligibility are used by the 
varsity teams on campus, This means that strict grade point average 
and credit nour qualifications must be observed by all participants. 

It is the conviction of the Athletic Committee that IU-PU should 
reverently adhere to all NCAA regulations. The feeling is that, should 
application for membership to that organization be made in the future, a 
histoy of such rule following would make easier the transition. 

No one questioned this logic until this most recent unfortunate 
incident. The players in question did not meet these requirements, but 
this was not established until the fall seasons had run their course. 

Asa band-aid measure, the Athletic Committee voted to forfeit those 
contests which were won with the use of ineligible players. The 
committee also is considering not granting varsity awards to these three 
or four athletes. 

While everyone is arguing whether or not awards should be given, the 
real issue is being confused. Given the type of campus we have, should we 
be concerned about national athletic affiliation? 

The advantages of such affiliation are obvious. The disadvantages 
are not so clear. 

For instance, the NCAA does not allow part-time students to 
participate This eliminates a substantial number of IU-PU students. 
These are the same students that are usually left out in the cold. 

It is time the Athltic Committee took a good, hard look at this whole 
business of NCAA affiliation. It just may not be good for thii campus. 

The present problem will go away, but others will replace it. The 
committee had better grab the bull by the horns while it still has the 
chance. 

Nader and the establishment

assessment of Ralph Nader as a booster of the free-enterprise system, 
even though the assessment comes from the nation's top defender of U. S. 
capitalism. 

"The whole point of Nader," U.S. Chamber of Commerce President 
Edward B. Rust said recently, "...is his single-minded dedication to 
making marketplace realities of the very virtues that businessmen 
ascribe to the system." 

Rust's comments at a business meeting in Chicago were not entirely 
tongue-in-cheek. He warned his audience that Nader's targets in his 
consumer crusade are "the dissatisfactions and the frustrations that are 
widespread among American consumers." 

In brief, the patient has conceded the doctor's skill as a diagnostician, 
but rejects his questionable prescriptions. 

Nader's penchant for major surgery -- when an aspirin might be 
sufficient remedy - is emphasized in his attack this week on nuclear 
energy. 

In predicting a ban in five years on construction of nuclear power 
plants, Nader thoroughly confused a meeting of the Western Governors 
Conference in Oregon, whose members generally view nuclear power as 
one solution to the energy shortage. 

He accused the Atomic Energy Commission of suppressing evidence 
of the danger of nuclear power plants, citing studies which show that tens 
of thousands of people could be killed in a major accident, which would 
also cause generations of human genetic defects and leave billions of 
dollars in property damage. 

Nader's plan, however, would perpetuate the energy crisis and its 
threat to American productivity and living standards, while the nation 
searches for value "alternatives." 

William Doub, an AEC member, responded to Nader's charge. "I do 
not expect," he said, "the kind of.. .disaster you predict to happen today, 
in this decade or in this century." 

But Nader has again exposed an issue of concern to the public, which 
deserves repeated reassurances. 

And if he is to become a full-fledged member of the system, Nader 
should accept the commissioner's invitation to sit down with him and 
discuss the situation. 



Drug price spread 
shocks probers 



nation's so-called "drug culture," the 
pharmaceutical and advertising in- 
dustries and government efforts to 



By FRANK MACOIY1BER 

Sen. Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis.. who 
probably knows more about the 
practices of drug manufacturers than 
any member of the U.S. Congress, 
can't decide which is worse -- the 
shocking price spread of pills and 
elixirs or the billion-dollar annual 
advertising and promotion ballyhoo 
America's pill-poppers must finance. 

Nelson, a two-term Wisconsin 
governor, is chairman of the Senate 
Small Business Committee's monopo- 
ly subcommittee which has been 
studying the pharmaceutical industry 
since 1967. 

He also is a member o( I he Senate 
Labor and Public Welfare Commit- 
tee's health subcommittee which 
handles health legislation, including 
drug controls. 

Nelson wears a third hat as a 
member of the Senate Finance 
Committee which has legislative 
jurisdiction over Medicare and Medi- 

"For years the American people 
have been forced to pay the highest 
prices for drugs - prices which fall 
most heavily on those who are least 
able to afford them - the sick, the 
poor and the aged," Nelson declares. 
After long hearing, he blames the 
high cost of drugs on brand-name 
prescriptions by doctors and what he 
calls the monopolistic patenting and 
licensing policies of drug manufact- 

Drawing on the vast body of 
testimony and documents acquired by 
his subcommittee, Nelson points to 
some dramatic instances of drug 
price spreads. 

He points out, for example, that 
the Eli Lilly Co. has sold 100 tablets of 
Darvon to U.S. druggists for $7.02 and 
the same product in Ireland for $1.66 
and in Britain for $1.92. 

Ciba Pharmaceuticals has 
charged $3 for Doriden in this 
country; $1.23 in New Zealand; $1 in 
Britain and 92 cents in Ireland, the 
senator says. The firm also has 
charged druggists $39.50 for 1,000 
tablets of Serpasil, a drug which 
lowers blood pressure. When it was 
ordered by the U. S. Defense 
Department under its generic name 
of reserpine, the cost was 60 cents per 
1,000, he adds. 

In this country Pfizer charged 
$20.48 for 100 Terramycin tablets, but 
sold the antibiotic in Brazil for $4.63 
per 100 and in New Zealand for $3.68. 

The senator recalls that in 1967 
the City of New York bought 1,000 
tablets of Benadryl, brand name of an 
antihistamine, for $15.63. 

When it purchased the same drug 
in the same amount from the same 
firm, Parke Davis, under its generic 
name, the city paid S3 per 1,000. 

A recent California Public Inter- 
est Group (CALP1RG) survey reflect- 
ed widespread price difference in the 
same drugs from store to store. A 
birth control pill named Orval, for 
example, sold for $3.35 for a 



supply at one drugstore and $1.89 for 
the same amount at another. 

A drug called Flagyl, used to 
treat vaginal infections, sold for 
$24.45 at one drugstore and for $9.95 at 
another. 

Investigators said many pharma- 
cies refused to disclose their prices, 
for fear they would violate a state law 
prohibiting them from advertising 
prescription drug prices. The law is 
on the books in about 30 states but 
appears to be losing ground. 

This year North Dakota, Minne- 



enacted measures allowing 
in-store drug price posting. New York 
state, moving even a step further, 
beginning next Jan. 1 will require 
posting of 150 most frequently sold 
prescription drugs. 

Sen. Nelson and Rep. Benjamin 
Rosenthal, D-N.Y, whose office con- 
ducted an independent survey of the 
widening gaps between prices for the 
same drug, believe the price spread 
can be wiped out only if all states 
enact laws requiring public posting or 
advertising of prescription drug 
prices, so buyers can "shop" for their

"This means that at least $5,000 is 
being spent per year on each doctor tc 
persuade him to prescribe drugs. 

"In my judgment, drug advertis 
ing by its very nature cannot providt 
unbiased information to physicians.' 

The result: "A vast overuse ol 
drugs in this country," says Sen 




Nelson.

Despite the Marxists' loud weep- 
ing and gnashing of teeth over the 
military coup that ended Chile's 
experiment in Marxism, there is 
agreement among the far leftists that 
President Salvador Allende never had 
all the popular support, the backing of 
the masses, that he needed to 
succeed. 

No less an expert than Cuban 
Premier Fidel Castro, who spent 25 
days visitng Chile late in 1971, was the 
first to say so. 

Castro declared publicly, in his 
farewell address in Santiago, that 
"the success or the failure of the 
Chilean revolutionary process will 
depend on the victory of the 
ideological struggle, on the mobiliza- 
tion of the masses and on the ability 
and skill of the revolutionaries in 
growing, in winning over the middle 
strata of the population." He 
disparaged the attendance at the 
farewell rally, saying "this number

In order to broaden their intellec-

traveled extensively. According to 
what I heard recently, about 50 per 
cent went to Muncie and Decatur on 
the weekends. As to the students, 60 
per cent saw departing planes from 
Baer Field airport, and most intend to 
fly to Chicago, whenever free tickets 
will be provided. 

As to the city itself, it possesses a 
variety of organizations and groups, 
which contribute to the creative

Thus large scope of cultural 
events may vary from listening to 
local commercials, going to a kiddy 
play, rummage sales or Glenbrook. 

This atmosphere of cerebral 
excitement has its beneficial influ- 
ence on our university, and especially 
on our students. While teaching at 
IU-PU I always admired their 
working and thinking power, contri- 
buting to the well-being and well- 



thinking of our academically oriented 
community. My typical student 
averaged daily 5 hours work to pay 
for his ultra-modern apartment, 4 - 
for Baracuda, 3 - for furniture, 3 - for 
food. He slept 4 hours, was recovering 
from tiredness in IU-PU classrooms 
for 6, studied job ads in local 
newspapers for 2 hours, saw his 
girlfriend or wife for 15 minutes and 
thought about doing his homework for 
10 minutes. Thus he achieved 27 hours 
25 minutes in a 24 hour day, which is 
speaking for itself. 

All this illustrates the point, that 
our institution can and will thrive on 
intellectual stimuli provided by its 
staff, students and the city, without an

A lengthy commentary on the

per cent so far in 1973, Allende's 
dilemma was either "coup d'etat or

A CAR SHOULDN'T HAVE 
DISC BRAKES JUST TO 
MAKE IT SELL BETTER. 



Disc brakes are a hot selling item. 

So several manufacturers are 
beginning to make them standard on 
their front wheels. 

Volvo has power-assisted disc 
brakes on all four wheels. Not to sell 
you. To stop you. 

Disc brakes have been standard 
with us for years. Because we believe 
they're more efficient than drum 
brakes. They resist fading, even after 
repeated panic stops. 

The law says all cars must have 
two braking circuits. Volvo did better 
than that before the law was made. 
With two triangular circuits. Each 
controls three wheels. So if one circuit 
fails, you still have about 80% of your 
braking power. 

We also have a device to help 
prevent your rear wheels from locking 
in an emergency stop. 

Great brakes are one of many 
features that have long been standard 
on Volvo. 

For some time we've also had firm 
suspension and radial tires to keep you 
in touch with the road. 

A rear window defroster. 

Bucket seats with adjustable back 
supports. 

Front and rear ends which absorb 
the impact of a collision instead of 
passing it on to the passenger 
compartment. 

Other manufacturers are 
beginning to "introduce" some of these 
features because people are beginning 
to want them. 

We keep putting them all in Volvo, 
because we think you need them.

e than just 






of having multiple orgasms, "problems" such t 
you describe have also surfaced. Multiple orgasms in a 
woman is primarily of physiological significance in that it 
points to a biological difference in terms of sexual response 
between males and females of the human species, ft is 
impossible, and in my estimation, ludicrous to place a 
qualitative judgment on this capacity Especially, when you 
indicate that you are satisfied and fulfilled after having 

I iiave spoken with women who have the capacity for 
multiple orgasms who still prefer a single orgasm and find 
that more satisfying. Many women, particularly as they get 
older and have more sexual experience, can develop a 
capacity for more than a single orgasm in one sexual 
encounter. Also, women not infrequently experience more 
than one climax when masturbating since they have 
greater control over sexual stimulation. Again, this appears 
to be of greater academic interest than of practical 
significance. 

In regard to your boyfriend's capacity for more than 
one orgasm, this is primarily related to being young and 
this ability tends to wane in the mid twenties until the lapse 
between successive ejaculations lengthens to the point 
where they can no longer be considered multiple. 

QUESTION: Two months ago I contracted gonorrhea from 
sexual activity. Recognizing the, symptoms, a burning 
sensation and a discharge, I immediately saw a doctor who 
put me on penicillin tablets for about a week. The symptoms 
disappeared but the area of concern remained extremely 
sensitive and prone to irritation. I began to try a variety of 
other medicines recommended by the doctor. Maybe the 
penicillin tablets only partially killed the infection.The area 
of concern is around the opening of the entire head of the 
penis. I am at my wit's end. 

ANSWER: You received the wrong treatment for 
gonorrhea. Penicillin is used in the treatment of gonorrhea, 
and this is the drug of choice, but it should only be given by 
injection in high doses. Usually one such injection is 
adequate, but by giving lower doses of penicillin over a long 
period of time there is a serious risk of not completely 
eradicating the infection and leading to the symptoms you

there is a question as to how many started just as your did. I

QUESTION: When I get an erection my penis does not go 
straight out but has a curve to it. Actually, it takes the shape 
of a banana. I have noticed no other peculiarities about my 
penis although I am sure there is something wrong with me. 

ANSWER: Most penises curve this way or that way a little 
bit. The majority of penises have a slight upward curve to 
them and your banana analogy is appropriate; there is 
nothing wrong. I receive almost as many questions about 
the shape of penises as I do about the size of penises. In this 
materialistic age. it is reassuring to know that some people 
are concerned about esthetics.

Boast 8-4 record 



ByPHIl.HARTMANN 

The old sports cliche that every town loves a winner and scorns a 
loser is often true on the surface. Take an average pro sports team which 
draws 16 385 fans per contest. If that team becomes a loser, it probably 
will soon be performing in front of 6,385 die-hards. But if it jells into a 
winner, the crowd count may skyrocket to a profitable 26,385 overnight. 

However, all major pro sports cities across this country do not 
behave the same. Some cities are warm and patronizing to their home 
squads whether the clubs are faring well or badly, within limits, of 
course. And then there are fans of other cities who will virtually boycott 
their team on the slightest hint of mediocrity. 

Pennsylvania is the home for two major sports cities, Pittsburgh and 
Philadelphia. For years fans in the Quaker City have had little to cheer 

Last year the basketball 76'ers were the worst team in NBA history. 
The baseball Phillies and football Eagles have been primarily 
cellar-dwellers for years, 

Pittsburgh, on the other hand, has at least been blessed with a great 
baseball team in the last decade. Yet pro basketball was introduced 
several years ago and flopped badly. 

A comparison between the two cities begins to show and can be best 
described by the following example: late last August the Philadelphia 
Phillies were playing host to an average National League rival. The 
Phillies were out of the NL East Division race, yet drew 23,450 fans. 

The Pirates were home, too, battling the St. Louis Cardinals for first 
place in the same NL East Division. For this headliner clash atthe 
beautiful new Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh, the Bucs drew 11,2000 
fans. Is the Steel City really the center of the opera? 

The top overall pro sports towns in the U.S. are Los Angeles and 
Cincinnali. Sports writers in these cities are fair through good and bad 
times alike, and are notable in giving due recognition to many deserving 
pro athletes, not just a handful of super-salaried super stars. 

The fans are warm and sincere; if a star from the opposition breaks a 
sports record in LA. or Cincinnati, he'll get just as great an ovation as he 
would in his own home town. 

In New York in July, sports writers were calling for the scalp of Yogi 
Berra. And many of the fans who still went to Shea Stadium went to lay 
their share of jeers and profanities on their struggling team. 

Then the injurv-riddled Mets staged a brilliant rebound. In a month 
they went from last in the NL East to first. In the playoffs they beat the 
powerful favorite, Cincinnati, for the NL pennant. 

And lo and behold, the great die-hard miracle Met fans were back by 
the thousands! They will all swear they were there all the time, 

At least everybody knows they were there in that final playoff tilt 
with Cincinnati. After the game before millions on national television, 
thousands of great "never-say-die" Met fans poured onto the field, 
trampling those who were straining for the exits. The playing field was 
shredded; the players were shocked. 

The great city of Chicago at least ties New York for the sports town 
rotten apple award. If the Cubbies or White Sox are winners, their 
ballparks will be full If they are just average or are losers, their 
ballparks will be empty, Chicago sports writers in bad times have a 
thoroughly nauseating, pessimistic style. 

Ferguson Jenkins, past superstar pitcher with the Cubs, can tell you 
all about Chicago fans. Fergie came into 1973 with a string of 
accomplishments (all as a Cub&gt; a mile long. He held the Cubs up for years 
with brilliant pitching, and gave every Cub fan memories never to be 
forgotten. 

Yet in 1973, Jenkins couldn't put it together. Did his fans and writers 
sympathize with him, urge him on, stick with him through a difficult 
period ? 

No, they didn't. They crucified him. 

Oakland Athletic star Reggie Jackson wants to get away from his 
town and owner Charlie Finley. He says he'll go anywhere else to play 
ball. Except Chicago.

Netters finish season 



The Indiana-Purdue Mastodon late in the s 



coaching of Dr. Charles Bolyard and 
Dr. Ben Becker, has completed a 
spectacular season of tennis action. 
An impressive 8-4 record speaks for 
the talent and dedication of the team 
members. The Mastodon netters 
completely white-washed three of 
their opponents and looked very 
convincing in all of their wins. Even in 
the losses, the Mastodons showed 
great poise. Coach Bolyard pointed 
out that every loss could have been a 
victory if the Mastodons would have 
been able to pull out a few games (not 
matches, but games). 

Coach Bolyard's optimistic pre- 
season prediction of a 10-5 record 
turned out to be a relatively reliable 
prognostication. The Mastodons 
probably could have had a better 
record than that, but one sure victory 
and one very posible victory were 
cancelled. The Concordia Saxons, 
who had a 5-4 record at the time they 
were to play Indiana-Purdue, cancel- 
led the match against the Mastodons 
because they wanted to finish the 
season above .500. And a match with 
Goshen had to be postponed because 



Bethel, Huntington, and Bible 
College were all double victims of the 
aggressive Mastodon squad, 



Northern Indiana managed to squeak 

out a 5-4 win over the Mastodons, and 
Grace, Tri-State, and Spring Arbor 
earned hard-fought 6-3 victories. 



Purdue tennis team. The team won 
nearly 70 percent of all of its matches. 
Senior sensation Steve Spoltman 
played consistently throughout the 
season, leading the team with an 
almost unbelievable 20-2 record. He 
was successful in 11 of 12 singles 
matches and teamed with a partner to 
win 9 of 10 matches in doubles. Not 
only was Spoltman's record impres- 
sive, but in the majority of his 



Mike Schone actually sported the 
best record on the team at 9-0, but he 
was the team's 7th man and played 
against the least talented competi- 
tion. An undefeated record indicates 
the kind of dedicated competitor Mike 
Schone is. 

Tom White and freshman Dave 
Goldsmith also displayed great talent 
and impressive records. White had a 
remarkable 15-3 record with a clean 
8-0 slate in doubles competition. White 
and Spoltman often doubled up and 
always won. Goldsmith, who played 
6th man most of the season, pleased 
Coach Bolyard with his 12-4 record. 
He lost only one singles match and 
played in many tough double matches 
with Mike Corner as his partner. 
Goldsmith is one of the brightest 
future hopes for the Mastodons. He 
showed great poise and talent in his 
first year of college competitio 




Mike Corner was another new 
addition to the team this year. He 

contributed greatly, finishing with a 
respectable 14-7 record. He won 7 
times in both singles and doubles. 
Corner and Spoltman kept the team 
going in the early stages of 



for the 

Mastodons. Even though his final 8-8 
record wasn't one of the better ones 
on the team, he proved worthy of his 



usually stuck with meeting the 
competition's best player. 

Steve Beltz, who played in the top 
three positions throughout the year, 
finished with an 8-7 record. Beltz had 
the best record of the top three men, 
indicating that he was able to hold his 
own. An example of B eltz's fine 
playing ability occurred in a match 
against Huntington College when 
Beltz humiliated his opponent in 



tennis 



number two singles, 6-0, 6-1. 

John Saurer had a not very 
successful season with a 4-10 record, 
but he will still an important part of 
the team. He faced some of the 
toughtest competition around the 
state, including the number one man 
for Spring Arbor, who starred for a 
junior college team that was runner- 
up in the National Junior College 
Tennis Tournament. 

Gene Chaffin saw little action this 
year as the team's eighth man, but 
did manage a good 5-1 record. Chaffin 
and Schone teamed up in four 
successful doubles matches. 

Pamela Craig wasn't actually a 
full-season player for the Mastodons, 
but she did compete in one doubles 
with Gene Chaffin as her partner. 



They lost. She was the first female 
player to represent the Mastodons in 
tennis, but unfortunately she was 
more a Court than a King. Coach 
Becker put Pam in number three 
doubles, explaining that the match 
had already been won and it was his 
job to give everyone a chance to play. 
Steve Spoltman and Galen Yordy 
will be the primary losses for next 
year's team but, wit the returnees and 
several promising newcomers, the 
team should again be impressive. 
Withthe fine coaching of Bolyard and 
Becker, the team is bound to continue 
improving. An 8-4 record might be 
difficult to beat, but if the tennis team 
improves as much next year as it did 
this year, you can bet that record will

COUNTER-ANALYSIS 

With only two weeks of regular season action left in the intramural 
football program, wewould like to give you our slanted look on sports. The 
summaries listed below are our biased opinion of how Intramural 
Football '73 has progressed. Our ranking of teams and a biased synopsis 
of each follows: 

In first place we have two teams who have different approaches to 
football. Stoneface, a somewhat physical team, had a very good chance of 
taking it all in presason polls. However, they ran into some rather 
unexpected competition midway in the season. It is our opinion that 
Stoneface has softened its rock-hard crust. 

Terry Kundysek, our defensive specialist, has said about Stoneface, 
"They'd be great if they had the Super Jock defense." 

Kevin Tonno, our offensive specialist has, in a tirade of modesty, 
informed us that Stoneface would be better with a qualified quarterback. 

All in all, Jacquay's boys are a sound team and could be a difficult 
threat if only they had a coach. 

The Smith team, alias the Posse, has been placed in a position similar 
to that of Stoneface when it comes to a coaching staff, Terry Kundysek 
reiterates that Smith has a sound defense, depending on the position of 
Bob Werling. The bench strength of Smitty's team has been analyzed by a 
member of the PBWA (Professional Bench Warmers Association) as 
adequate should injuries necessitate replacement. 

The Super Jocks, currently holding down third place, have not needed 
to put more than 25 points on the board in any one game because of their 
superior defense. Led by field generals Kundysek and Clements this 
squad has held their opponents to six points in four games. The Super 
Jocks suffered their only loss to a team which has been averaging well 
over 25 points per game. The offensive ground game is adequate to score 
enough points to win their games. 

Of the teams we have played, we feel that the 73 Calt's deserve the 
next spot. They have improved greatly since merging with Joe Farrell's 
team. We should wan the Frosh to look out for the 73 Calt's. 

Circle K is next in our standings, due to their convincing win over the 
Frosh. Their defense stands second only to the Super Jocks in holding 
number one team Stoneface to eight points. 

The Frosh are a swell bunch of guys, high on enthusiasm but low in 
athletic ability. They are led by Vince Lochbihler who doesn't know when 
to stop talking or writing. To tell the truth, they threaten no one and 
should be a good team to draw for the tournament. They scare no one due 
to their inept offense. 

According to last week's Communicator, this team was rated fourth. 
We feel that it is our duty to point out that their only victory is a forfeited 
game against the Geology Club. No team required many points to defeat 
the Frosh, considering they have scored a grand total of six points for the
