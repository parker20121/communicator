ByMARKFRANKE 

"Super-jock" Phil Gardner of 
radio station WLYV is definitely 
leaving that station but he is not 
determined to leave Fort Wayne, the 
Communicator learned lasl Saturday 
from a close friend of Gardner's. 

The friend, who asked not to be 
identified, said that Gardner would 
consider an offer from radio station 
WMEE, but the super-jock would not 
apply with WMEE for a job. 

Burt Sherwood, general manager 
of WMEE, "came down" on Gardner 



i offer to Gardner. 

The friend said that Gardner 
would not approach WMEE, but if 
Sherwood would make an offer, the 
super-jock would consider it. 

Gardner refused to comment on 
the WMEE matter but he did confirm 
that he definitely will be leaving 
WLYV. 

"I don't plan to be here too long," 
said Gardner. He said that he was 
looking for and negotiating positions 
with other stations. 

"You have lo wail for the ripening 
you want," said the super -jock.

Gardner said that it may be a 
week or so before he leaves WLYV, or 
it may be longer. He said that he still 
may be with WLYV when that station 
adopts a country-politan format in 
mid-March. 

Gardner said that he is interested 
in another station, but that station 
cannot bring him in until it irons out 



Film class assignment worthwhile 



Jan Sanner and Bill Hibben decided 
to make a class assignment worth- 
while to someone besides themselves. 

Both students enrolled in the film 
production class taught by Dale Ware 
last fall. 

The main requirement of the class 
was to make a super 8 milimeter film 

Mrs. Sanner, whose husband works 
at Phelps Dodge Magnet Magnet Wire 
Company, went to the marketing 
department there and asked for 
permission to make an instructional 
film for the company. The company 
gave her permissionm and she went 

The film instructed employees in 
the reading a 



i hand-held measuring the 



The company liked the film and 
asked the student to make another fi 
1m for them. Phelps Dodge purchased 
new photography equipment for 
Mrs.Sanner to use in making the 
second film. She is using the second 
film in another advance, independent 
studt course. 

Mrs. Sanner, who has had previous 
film-making experience from a class 
offered earlier on this campus and 
from making personal travel-logs, 
said, "I've really learned from 
making these films for Phelps." 

Hibben made a film about the 
Drop-In Child Care Center that will be 
used to illustrate the organization of 



groups. 

Hibben used scenes of children 
playing, an informative speech by 
Nancy Getzin, director of the center, 
and shots of the center's facilities in 
his informative film. 

Roy Hanouer, another member of 
the class, made a film on a day in the 
life of WOWO newscaster Jay 
Johnson. Jerry McClish made a film 
on the Ride-Along program with the 
Fort Wayne Police Department. 
Another class member made an 
animated film. 

Some of these films will be shown 
on campus March 27 in the Student 

Ware will be presenting a paper 
on the production of super 8 




t by 'Smoke.' The concert was given 



millimeter film at the International 
Communications Convention in New 
Orleans April 27. Along with the 
paper, Ware will show the films from 
the class. Mrs. Sanner wil also attend 
the conference. 

Maryland studies 
death penalty 

ANNAPOLIS (FCNS)-The Mary- 
land legislature has renewed its 
debate on capital punishment, and 
has received testimony from diverse 
citizens' groups. 

"A death penalty will be passed in 
Maryland in 1974," said Del. Edward 
Dabrowski Jr. (D-Baltimore City). 
He told a House Committee on the 
Judiciary that his bill would impose a 
mandatory death sentence on persons 
convicted of first-degree murder in 
connection with prison confinements 
or escapes, kidnaping or a contract 
killing for monetary gain. 

Del. Richard Ryne (D-Baltimore 
County), who has co-sponsored a 
similar measure, said police and 
prison guards need to have the death 
penalty restored to give them more 
protection in their jobs. 

European trip 
announced 

The French and European Exper- 
ience is the name of the month-long 
travel-study program being organ- 
ized by Clinton Butler, French 
professor at Indiana-Purdue. 

The tour begins May 9 and ends 
June 7. Although the participants 
need not be students, three hours of 
credit will be offered to Indiana 
students for the tour. 

The total cost of the month-long 
tour will be $1080, excluding only one 
meal per day and spending money. 

The itinerary, which is structured 
rather informally, includes time in 
London, Normandy, Spain, the Rivi- 
era, Venice, Yugoslavia, Germany, 
and Switzerland. The tour will 
concentrate mostly on France. 

Prospective participants must 
apply before March 9 by contacting 
Butler at 482-5863 or 483-8601. 

Anyone interested in hearing 
more about the tour is invited to 
attend a color slide presentation 
March 4 and March 7 at 4140 p.m. or 
6:30 p.m. in G51 of Kettler hall. 

Butler lived in France for three 
years and has taken small student 
groups on tours through France. He 
was the assistant director in the 
Brigham Young University Semester 
in France program in 1968.

Vic Sterling, general manager of 
WLYV, said that Gardner has not yet 
officially resigned, but he has 
verbally indicated his desire to quit on

world. He has been cited by the 
magazine on two occasions for the 
quality of his radio programs. 

Sterling said that WLYV would 
not change its call letters as had 
earlier been reported by the Com- 
municator. He said that a change had 
been considered but "there was no 
reason to change them." 

He denied that the decision to 
retain the call letters WLYV was in 
part prompted by the recent change 
in theme by stations WFWR-WCMX, 
Die only other country music stations 
in Fort Wayne. 

The Communicator reported two 
weeks ago that WLYV would adopt a 
"country cousin" image. Shortly 

Drunk driving 

South Africans used to imbibing 
their traditional "sundowner" after 
work may have to change their 
habits. 

The courts, shocked by a high 
accident rale, are imposing fines of 
up to $705 for drunk driving. And 
offenders may also be thrown into jail 
for up to a year. 



WFWR and WCMX are jointly 
managed stations that simulcast, or 
broadcast identical programming 
over both theAM and FM air waves. 
According to a number of sources 
close to those two stations, WFWR- 
WCMX have modified their program- 
ming to prepare for the new 
competition from WLYV. 

Sterling said that WLYV made 
the decision to go country to "offer the 
market a different sound than it has." 
He said that the station did not want to 
continue playing the same kind of 
music as WMEE and WOWO. 

The station manager said that he 
expects WLYV's audience to increase 
in the 25-60 year old bracket and fall in 
the under 25 age group. He hopes to 
retain much of the station's IU-PU 
listeners, many of which he feels do 
appreciate country music. 

WLYV will offer a country-politan 
format. This will include such country 
artists as Bobby (loldsboro and John 
Denver and a Top-40 delivery. The 
format change will come in mid- 
March. 

Sterling said that the station is 
attempting to place its present rock

Prison violence 
key to revolt 



Student independence 

The Indiana University Student Association (IUSA), a new name for 
an old student government organization on the Bloomington campus, is 
launching a drive for a student to be appointed to the I,U. Board of 
Trustees. 

As in all past schemes that have been concocted by the I.U. student 
government, the support of the regional campus organizations is 
requested. 

IU-PTJ Student Body President Brock Able, much to his credit, has 
chosen not to get involved in this campaign. 

This decision by Able was not made on the grounds that he opposes 
the concept of a student trustee. The merits of a student member of the 
board of trustees is another matter entirely. 

Rather, he stayed clear of the movement because of his fundamental 
dislike for Bloomington headed programs. 

The IUSA takes a very paternalistic attitude toward •'its" regional 
campuses. At least, that is the impression that IU-PU student 
governments have had in the past. 

Bloomington likes to give appearances of student solidarity. The 
regional campus students are expected to look to Bloomington for 
leadership and protection. 

Where was this leadership and protection when the report of the 
Higher Education Commission appeared to threaten the future of the 
regional &gt; arupuses? The regional campuses were left on their own to fight 
that one. 

But now the IUSA wants to put one of its students on the board of 
trustees, so it is turning to the regional campuses once again for 
solidarity. 

Able wisely decided that the interests of IU-PU will not best be served 
by fighting for a Bloomington student trustee. Other regional campus 
student body presidents obviously felt the same way. as only three of the 
eight I.U, campuses were represented al a recent meeting to discuss the 

Mr. Able is to be commended for demonstrating independence of the 
Bloomington sludent government. After all, would the IUSA fight to 
increase regional campus representation on the board of trustees? 



Student elections 



Campus student elections are less than two months away Would-be 
student body presidents are busy lining up support and senatorial 
candidates. 

' Campus elections used to be intriguing affairs. The campaigns were 
hard fought, with all candidates going for broke. 
: It used to be nearly impossible for an IU-PU student to avoid being 
confronted by a number of candidates seeking his vote. 

These elections used to be simulations of the real thing. Detailed 
campaign plans were drawn up, and a master strategy of some sort 
directed all aspects of the campaign, from the selection of the ticket to 
designing of flyers. 

The last election, and to a lesser extent the one before that, were not 
up to par. The candidates did not have their hearts in it, and party 
organizations were weak or non-existent. 

This election promises to be different, if we have read the signs 
correctly. Many activist types are openly upset with the present student 
administration. Also, the Alliance for a Better Campus, the party in 
power for the last three years, appears to be split down the middle. 

It will be a pleasant change to see another hard fought campaign in 
the old Alliance for a Better Campus and Student Liberation Front style. 
We hope we are not disappointed. 



By COPLEY NEWS SERVICE 

SAN FRANCISCO - Murder in 
the streets and violence in the prisons 
are the keys to the overthrow of the 
U.S. government, according to the 
revolutionaries now working in the 
United States. 

Members of revolutionary groups 
have been visiting California and 
other U.S. prisons for several years, 
according to prison officials, in an 
effort to build a revolutonary army -- 
while other revolutionaries have 
turned to violence, murder and 
kidnaping in the streets. 

Venceremos, the Maoist revolu- 
tionary group that has been linked to 
the Symbionese Liberation Army - 
which claimed responsibility for 
kidnaping Patricia Hearst - has 
recruited heavily in California pri- 
sons, according to William Hankins, 
invesliniilmg sergeant at San Quen- 
tin. They have also visited prisons 
throughout the United States. 

Many members of the Black 
Guerrilla Family (BGFt, a revolu- 
tionary group of 150 to 200 hard-core 
members headquartered at the 
Deuell Vocational Institute in Califor- 
nia, are Venceremos members. 

Having gotten the BGF on their 
side, sources say. Venceremos is now 
attempting to get the two strongest 
prison gangs behind them - the 



„angs not only vie to 
control all the prisons in California, 
running strongarm rackets, gambling 
and homosexual prostitution in the 
institutions - as well as narcotics - 
but have moved into the streets. The 
Mexican Mafia in particular has 
murder and robbery squads in the 
streets of Los Angeles, according to 
official reports, and is recruiting 
heavily in Sacramento, moving into 
the San Francisco Bay Area and 
building an international narcotics 
operation. 

The New Family, on the other 
hand, controls the Central Valley and 
certain coastal towns such as Santa 
Barbara. 

Both of them are plums that the 
revolutionaries are anxious to pick. 

Venceremos has also reportedly 
contacted white gangs on the inside, 
such asihe Polar Bear Party. 

"Everything, in my opinion, 
seems to be pointing toward Vencer- 
emos." said Hankins. "Everything I 
have come across seems to be 
showing the Venceremos organization 
having their finger; 



i arid New Family in 1972 - and 
almost succeeded. 

A Venceremos woman started 
writing to Cheyenne Cadena, identi- 
fied as a Mafia leader at California's 
Chino prison. She urged him to make 
peace with the New Family prison 
gang and to join with them in the 
destruction of the prisons. 

Cheyenne - a young handsome 



man who was described by an

A THOUGHT IN TIME 

Students do think 



ByDAVEGASKILL 

Terry Doran's Theatre For Ideas 
visited the Student Union this past 
week under the sponsorship of the 
University Religious Forum and the 
Students for a Free Society. Under 
discussion, at least initially, was the 
topic "Why Students Don't Think." 
Impanelled for the occasion was a 
purported cross section of the 
university population, balanced by 
the inclusion of representatives from 
the faculty, administration, student 
body, and student services. Soon a 
small, but rapt, audience gathered to 
view, and under the encouragement 
of Doran, participate in the conversa- 
tion. Before long a reasonable 
dialogue had been achieved directed 
at resolving some sort of malfunction 
on the part of students' ability to 
think. 

The most remarkable aspect of 
the event was the cross-legged 
docility with which the panel and 
audience accepted the topic proposi- 
tion. No doubt apathy is rampant at 
this campus, but it is nothing short of 
incredible to watch a group of 
students and former students occupy 
ninety minutes in pursuit of such a 
sweeping generalization. No, wait. 
That wasn't exactly the case. Only 
about half of the time was spent by the 
group in handwringing over the

relative inability of their student 
consociates to think. The remainder 
of the program had the unmistakable 
flavor of a group therapy session. 
Near the end of the discussion, with 
the head-bobbing assent of the 
majority of listeners, it was conclud- 
ed that "truth" could best be 
discovered via an introspective ven- 
ture into the realm of one's own 
psyche. 

With all due respect to Terry 
Doran's organization and the valu- 
able work it is doing, this university, 
and country in general, needs that 
sort of "effete intellectual snobbery" 
about as bad as it needs the 
tax-evading Vice President who 
coined thequoted phrase. It is a form 
of arrogant condescension to predi- 
cate a discussion on the assumption 
that differences in educational moti- 
vation can be attributed to relative 
abilities to think. The very concept of 
political freedom, assuming that 



of differenci 
personal perception of reality. Too 
wordy? Let's put it another way: 
Different strokes for different folks. 
Consider, if you will, one of the 
examples spotlighted by a member of 
the audience during the program. 
Campus unrest during the sixties was 
prevalent enough, especially at large 
urban universities, to merit national 
coverage by the media. No one will 
soon forget the image of activists

single 



By AUDREY GELUS 

Vacation lime, when a woman 
should be most liberated, is just when 
she's usually least free. Most single 
women spend their time and money 
looking for eligible men at overpriced 
orts or flesh-on-demand 
tfies. In my opinion, they 
might just as well plant some palm 
'.rees in a singles har and stay home. 

Married women don't necessarily 
have it better. Ecstatic to be freed of 
Household drudgery, they often mis- 
(ake two weeks of being waited on for 
a change of life-style. 

Yet a vacation (which literally 
means freedom &gt; should be the time to 
escape from the commonplace, to 
savor great natural beauty, and to 
gubljte up new experiences that will 
eutalize and recharge us the rest of 
the year. 

I recently had such a liberated 
vacation cruising the British Virgin 
Islands aboard the 8S-foot schooner 
"Tiki," which (apologies to Gardner 
McKayi was formerly the star of the 



tures in City Island, 
the Tiki is based on Tortola, capital of 
the BVI and a ferryboat ride away 
from St Thomas. &lt;A word about 
sailing: I was very comfortable on the 



e islands are semi-inhabited.

as the only concessions to 
n. Consequently, there is al- 



most no evidence of what we call 
civilization and the surrounding 
Caribbean is so clear you can see the 
ocean floor 50 feet below. 

Sailing for me is the ultimate 



deck-starved senses soaking in sun 
and sky and breeze; to feel the power 
in the five huge sails the height of 
five-story buildings; to surrender to 
the rhythms of the sea as wind and 
wave beat against sail and hull. For 
me it would have been enough just to 
take the helm and guide and ship 
against the sea with the wind driving 
us along faster than an engine. 

But then there were the caves in 
the cliff walls of Tortola, where 
pirates once hid themselves and their 
booty. We rowed small boats through 
these towering caves just as bucca-

Spirit lifter 



By RUTH STAFFORD PEALE 

Everyone loves surprises and 
wonderful promises. Start each day 
with the exciting feeling that some- 
thing great may happen. 

God is always pouring blessings 
into the lives of people who have the 
sensitivity to see and receive. Such 
spiritually minded people have the 
capacity for wonder. Hence, wonders 
happen. 

"Eye hath not seen, nor ear 
heard, neither have entered into the 
heart of man, the things which God 
hath prepared for them that love 



flashlights to remind us of the 20th 
Century. The treasure has long since 
disappeared but centuries of water 
have created a jeweled belt through- 
out the caves. 

And then there was swimming off 
the boat or from beaches which the 
islanders describe as cool sand and 
warm water. And getting snorkeling 
lessons from the crew (braver spirits 
went scuba diving) and discovering

a former diver in the Swedish navy, I 
ventured out past our sheltered cove 
for the never-to-be-forgotten sight of 
the sun streaming through the ocean 
like a massive waterfall. 

And there was the Island of Virgin 
Gorda where some geological mys- 
tery had dumped giant boulders into a 
massive convoluted heap of caves and 
tunnels. And its gentle inlet of a beach 
surrounded by palm trees where I 
contentedly spent an entire day 
sunning, swimming and snorkeling. 
Or was it watching the purple

to forget the national anguish over the 
senseless killings at Kent State. 
Today the lack of unrest at campuses 
around the country is newsworthy. 
What has changed? The students, the 
universities, or both? 

Clearly, changes are apparent in 
both factors. Rigid adherence to a 
structured curriculum within a disci- 
pline has pretty much been discarded 
in favor of a variety of options. 
Students are much more likely to mob 
athletic fields (this campus excepted) 
than ROTC offices. Perhaps the most 
significant change is in the perception 
by a student Of his role at the school. If 
the majority of students view their 
education in terms of acquiring 
employment upon graduation, which 
seemed to be a major criticism by the 
group discussion, it could very well be 
that the majority of students feel 
social change can best be accom- 
plished from within the framework of 
the society. There is no doubt that a 
certain sense of intimidation is felt by 
many students upon experiencing an 
instructor's imposed viewpoint. In 
fact, perhaps a majority of students 
feel that some of the course 
requirements are irrelevant to their 
goals. But don't mistake classroom 
yawns for vocational apathy. The 
very students whose educational 
motives were imputed by the panel on 
"Why Students Don't Think" will 
graduate into important positions and 
inherit a certain power to effect 
change. They are, if you will, the 
Ralph Naders of tomorrow. Lord 
knows we need them. 

And the "truth" to which the 
majority of students aspire will 
definitely not be discovered anywhere 
near their psychic navels. Rather, it 
will be found only in the active pursuit 
of learned ideals. Students are not 
exempted from the imperatives of 
their environment. The myriad roles 
into which they are thrust as 
individual members of a society will 
condition and form their concept of 
"truth." As a vital factor of the 
environment, educational institutions 
will do well to remember that 
students are not being molded by 
curricula alone but by the extent to 
i the 



Students, therefore, do think. It 
comes as no surprise to most 
students, but it could very well 
revolutionize the patronizing panels 
being formed to stir student interest.

IF THIS HAPPENS-JUST LET HIM BE! 

"We interrupt 'The Waltons' television 
program to bring you this special sports 
bulletin! Flash! Bill Walton, top eager in 
the history of college basketball and leader 
of the UCLA Bruins who just annexed their 
third straight NCAA title, has just 
announced that he will not play profession- 
al basketball! According to the Sullivan 
award winner, his future plans are up in the 
air. He is reportedly considering becoming 
a forest ranger, park nature guide, or a 
wild berry taster under the tutorship of 
Ewell Gibbons. Walton is quoted as saying 
that money isn't the key to happiness, 
whatever that means." 

"We repeat, Bill Walton, superhuman 
American sports hero, has announced that 
he is not going to play pro basketball. Now 
back to the Waltons where John-boy has 
just gone on a nature hike with Bessie Sue. 

The next day we read in the newspaper 
about his decision and reactions to it. 

"Walton reportedly had a nightmare 
two days ago which greatly influenced his 
decision to pass up millions of American 
dollars plus fringe benefits like a new car 
every week and a lifetime membership in 
the Ronald McDonald Fan Club. Walton 
wouldn't reveal all the details of his 
terrifying bedtime experience but did 
reveal that it had to do with his getting 
abducted by four 8-10 giants who forced 
him to devour ten basketballs, valve and 
all, without even a glass of milk with which 
to wash the meal down. 

"The 6-11 Walton says he is fed up with 
a basketball. He's even fed up with his 
fans: 'How can they go stark raving mad 
over us? What do we do that's so 
important? Put a round ball in a basket? I 
wonder what's inside their brains.' 

"Walton cherishes his privacy; 'But 
it's pretty hard to be a private person when 
you run around in your underwear before 
15,000 fans and 40 million more on national 
TV.' 

"He was asked what else was 
important to him: 'Having fun. Enjoying 
life. Helping others. Being myself. Time, 
that's so important. That's why when the 



season's over I have to get away. That's 
why I sometimes wish I'd been blessed in 
something other than basktball.' 

"So Bill Walton has decided to pass up 
the chance to perhaps become the greatest 
pro basketball player of all time. Abdul 
jabbar, Elvin Hayes, and Bob Lanier were 
cornered for their reactions and all said, 
'Thank God.' Walton's supposed new 
general manager whimpered: 'I can't 
believe it. What more could we have done? 
I went out to California to talk to him and 
treated him just like a son. We went to 
McDonald's and had Big Macs, French 
fries, turnovers, more Big Macs, French 
fries and turnovers, and then Mike topped 
off his meal with some shakes, three of 
each kind. Gee, we had a swell time and 
now I'm so disappointed, so sick.' One 
could tell by looking at the carpet that the 
general manager had been sick. 

"John Wooden, mastermind of the 
Bruin dynasty was pegged for his reaction: 
'We've had so many kids through the 
years.. .Bill who?' 

"As Walton bows out, at least for now 
from the sports scene, he has no regrets 
from leaving the press scene as well: 'I'm 
just not a public person in any sense of the 
word. I think the media perceived me a 
certain way, always writing me up as the 
superstar. I mean, UCLA could play 
without me and win, but I couldn't play 
without them. And I found out very quickly 
that you have to make a choice.. .either 
interviews by the dozens or none at all. 
There are only so many hours in a day, and 
time is more important to me than 
anything. I spend 



basketball and school, 



s left for n 



"So Walton has passed up what 
thousands of others can only dream about." 

But does anyone care what Bill Walton 
dreams about? The preceding story has not 
happened yet although Walton's quotes are 
real and do give an indication that the story 
could easily happen.
