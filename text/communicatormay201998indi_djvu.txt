Getting involved on campus: 

The student activities connection 



Have spare time on your hand? Want lo gel 
involved? 

The Studenl Activities Office, Walb Rm. 
2 1 3, offers a number of ways lo get involved al 
IPFW. 

The purpose of the office is to promote 
extra-curricular and co-curricular activities 
which complemcm the educational process and 
which help students develop inio well-rounded 
individuals. 

One way to reach those goals is lo attend 
events and programs put on by the Student 
Activities Board (SAD). 

SAB provides the university community 
wiih a diversity of cultural, educational and 
social programs — everything from hypnotists 
lo "A Taste of Mexico," and from free lectures 
lo "Breakfast with Santa." 

Come out and enjoy the variety of 
activities! Most are free or have a nominal cost. 

If you'd like to be more than a participant, 
call the SAB office (481-6590) and find out 
how you can become a member. 

Another way lo gel involved at IPFW is lo 
join a club or an organization. 

IPFW has over fifty student organizations. 

Each of ihcse groups is individually gov- 
erned by IPFW students. 

Student organizations are divided into five 
categories: departmental dubs, religious orga- 
nizations, social Greek organizations, special 
interest clubs and honorary societies. 

Clubs and organizations are a greal way to 



pui classroom concepts to practice while gain- 
ing valuable leadership experience in the 
process. 

Whether it is ihe Accounting Society, The 
Society of Women Engineers, the Black 
Collegiate Caucus or a fraternity, gelling 
involved in a student group will give you extra 
experience that always looks good 10 future 
employers. 

The Office of Student Activities also pro- 
vides on-going leadership training for student 
leaders and potential campus leaders through- 
out the year. 

In addition, they provide rental information 
about off-campus housing. 

For more information about either of these 
services, please slop by Ihe office or call 481- 
6609. 

Don't worry about how to get involved, 
JUST DO IT! 

Studies show that students who gel 
involved do belter academically, and, as men- 
tioned earlier, it gives you thai added "edge" 
which employers are looking for. 

No mailer how good a student you are, 
employers want lo sec involvement and leader- 
ship. 

So stop by the Student Activities Office lo 
see how you can get involved and advance your 
future. It may make all ihe difference in your 
IPFW experience! 

Kim Jacobs, Student Activities Director 



Students 

travel 

through 

unique 

program 



Fifteen IPFW students are 
going greal distances to get 
their education — literally. 

They are participating in 
Ihe National Studenl 
Exchange (NSE) Program for 
the 1998-99 academic year. 



NSE offers students the 
opportunity to continue pro- 
gressing toward iheir IPFW 
degree while spending a 
semester or academic year at 
one of more ihan 100 oiher 
U.S. colleges or universities. 

The cost is similar to what 
the students are paying to 
attend IPFW. 

NSE's objective is for stu- 
dents to develop an increased 
awareness of cultural and geo- 
graphical differences within 
ihe U.S. and develop a better 
understanding of Iheir own 
academic, professional and 
personal goals. 

IPFW sludents will be 
attending several universities 
during ihe 1998-99 academic 



Graduation anxiety affects everyone, even the professors 




Julie Hook, of General Studies, right, checks sludents in her line one last time before stepping out in fronl 
of the crowd gathered at Ihe Allen County Memorial Coliseum for graduation. More photos on page 6. 



IPSGA President has student 
concerns at forefront of agenda 



Welcome lo IPFW! 

I am glad that you are here and hope 
that your experiences, both academically 
and socially, will be memorable. 

IPFW is a school to be proud of, and 
I hope lhai you will enjoy your time 
here. 

The most 
important priorily 
of Ihe Indiana- 
Purdue Studenl 
Government 
Association is to 
make sure thai 
your lime here on 
this campus is 
pleasant 

Sludenis' 

Government is 

aimed al keeping 

an eye oui to make 

sure that students' 

rights and ideals 

are being upheld, and also to give the 

students at IPFW some activities lo 

improve your campus life. 

We financially support many pro- 
grams on campus and we help support 




Shawn 
Heit 



student organizations however we can. 

We also provide student activity pro- 
gramming so thai your time here is nol 
all work and no play. 

Students' Government is made up of 
four branches: the executive branch, the 
Student Senate, ihe Student Activities 
Board (SAB), and the Judicial Court. 

Each one of these branches has a dif- 
ferent purpose or agenda; however, our 
interest is the same - STUDENTS. 

Three out of these four branches are 
almost always looking (o increase Iheir 
membership numbers. 

The only way that we arc able to do 
things for the students is if we have input 
from ihe students on what they feel 
should be done. 

Being a Student Government mem- 
ber may be a commitment, but ihe 
amount of time and energy required is 
small compared to the benefits that you 
and ihe students on this campus will 
receive from your work. 

Ii is an easy process to become 
involved. 

All you need to do to become a stu- 
dent senator or a student activities board 
member is to pick up a petition from 



Walb 225, fill it oui and turn it back in. 

Judicial Court justices are appointed 
by the President of the Student Body, so 
if you are interested in serving on our 
judicial court, please contact me at 481- 
6588. 

You can also slop by my office, 
Walb225B. 

There are many things that can be 
done for sludents if we work together 
and share ideas. 

This is another way that you may get 
involved: Pick up the phone and tell me 
what your ideas or concerns are aboui 
IPFW and its students. 

I am willing to fight for ihe students 
with ideas of my own, bul I am also very 
eager and willing to lake your ideas and 
see what can be done. 

Again, welcome to IPFW and if 
there is anything that I can do to help. 
please do not hesitate to call me. 

My office is Walb Union 225B and 
my phone number is 481-6588.

As sludents. we need to become 
more aware of our surroundings and the 
political arena of college aid/education.

Technology Protocol Committee, 



(ITPC), and Computer &amp;. Data

dent groups at IPFW will be on universi- 
ty servers by the end of ihe 1998-99 aca- 
demic year. 
The cost of schooling:

Wiih these objeciivcs in mind, we are 
trying lo make an impact on your school 
and your life. 

We want you io feel IPFW is your 
school and you have a connection to your

Some really crazy stuff 



by Joan Poulsen 



On Wednesday, May 13. IPFW 
held its annual commencement 
ceremony. 

For many, it signified the end of 
school, or at least one phase of high- 
er education. However, area high 
schools will be holding their own 
commencement exercises soon loo. 
Many of these graduates will attend 
college, and the majority of area 
graduates who will attend college, 
choose to go to IPFW. 

The summer sessions and fall 
semester will be die first time these 
students will be 'going fo college. It 
also means Die return of many adult 
students, and transfer students. With 
so many students coming from all of 
these various backgrounds to a sin- 
gle place to become educated, some 
advice may be helpful to aid in the 
success of IPFW's new students and 
freshmen, 

Regarding college in general, 1 
offer one warning: college is more 
difficult than high school. No matter 
what your major is, the work you put 
into class at college is more 
demanding dan your high school 
classes, even if you took all honor 
level classes. 

I had a full load of honor classes 
for my four years of high school, 
and was told repeatedly that college 



would require more work. I didn't 
believe them. After your first month 
of school, you'll realize they are 
right. To achieve a high GPA, or 
even a mediocre one, you do have to 
work and study more than in high 
school. This applies to all majors. 

I was a biology and prc-med 
major for three semesters, and have 
been an English major for one. I put 
in at least as many hours in my lib- 
eral art studies as I did in my science 
classes. 

The only difference is what you 
study. That warning aside, I will 
offer you a few more pieces of 
advice to help your academic career 
here to be a success. 

First, attend all of your classes, 
all of the time! By missing one day. 
you could miss a pop quiz for bonus 
points, or an assignment, or a signif- 
icant amount of material which will 
appear on a lest. 

As a freshman, I did skip class 
occasionally, and did actually miss 
the above-mentioned items. If you 
truly are sick, or your grandmother 
really did die, or you have to miss 
class for any other reason, contact 
your instructor about it, preferably 
before die absence. 

This will show that you really 
do value the class and your instruc- 



tor may even waive any penalties for 
absence. 

Until the first exam, do every 
assignment, read every chapter, and 
visit your instructor for any help you 
may need. After the first exam, 
you'll have a better idea of what you 
really need to do to excel in the 
class. 

Make contact with your profes- 
sors. This is especially true if you 
are doing well in the class, or if the 
subject is your major. 

If you make an effort to talk 
with your instructors, chances are 
that you will learn what he or she 
finds most important about the sub- 
ject. This means that you could have 
a belter idea of what may be on 
exams. Instructors also are wonder- 
ful references for jobs, and academ- 
ic programs. 

With regard to your major, I 
would advise that you choose your 
major because you enjoy that area of 
study. I do not recommend choosing 
a major because it leads well to a 
specific career you think you want. 

If you enjoy what you are doing 
and studying in class, you will enjoy 
a career in dial field, but if you don't 
enjoy what you are studying, you 
probably won't like the jobs you are 
qualified for with your degree. 



Also, don't be afraid to change 
your major. Do give it some thought 
before you do. otherwise you could 
be changing your major every week. 
But don't go through all of college 
hating what you're studying. You 
can use summer classes to help 
catch up on any lime you may have 
lost due to your change of major. 
With careful planning and advising, 
its very likely that you can still grad- 
uate on time. 

I also advise you to schedule 
your classes as early as possible. 
That way, you will have a better 
chance of getting die classes you 
need and want. That means you have 
a better chance of graduating in four 
years too. 

Also, don'l rule summer ses- 
sions out. Summer classes are usu- 
ally more relaxed, and can be a great 
way to get many of your classes "out 
of the way." 

I offer two final pieces of 
advice: don'l give up, and put your 
education first in your life. I give all 
of this advice to you based on my 
experiences here at IPFW, and at die 
West Lafayciie campus of Purdue 
University. 

I wish all students, especially 
the new ones, the best of luck and 
success. 



ST/^f=f= £CtfTOfZJ/*L 



Whether you are coming 
straight from high school or have 
just decided you need some higher 
form of education to get ahead in 
the work place, coming 10 college 
for the first lime may make it seem 
like a complicated place. 

Il may appear to be a place 
where there are so many rules and 
very few familiar faces for people 
who venture out into the world of 
higher learning. 

Just like any other institution or 
workplace, there are rules thai are 
set out in stone and some thai lay 
beneath the foundation of the rules 
set in stone. 

Neither of the sei of rules total- 
ly lakes precedent over the other, 
but ihe underlying rules are the ones 
thai are the hardest to find. 

Most of the rules of this fine 
institution are in the Bulletin of 
Undergraduate Programs . 

The rules ih.it we wish to 
inform you of. however, may not 
appear in any pamphlet or book that 
you may see during your stay here 
at IPFW. 

One of the most important rules 
■hat you need to know is to keep, 
review and understand your 
syllabi. These are the outlines that 
the professors give you to lei! you 
in advance what the course is and 
what is going to be done in class. 

No mailer how much you 
expect the professor to follow the 
syllabus, it will hardly ever happen. 
The ironic thing is that die professor 
will expect you to follow it lo every 
Hide word, especially on deadlines. 

It is best to check your syllabus 



as oflen as possible to make sure 
that you know what is supposed to 
be next on the agenda of the class. 

Finally, if you don'l understand 
everything on the syllabus ask your 
professor for an explanation. They 
should be more lhan happy lo clari- 
fy any questions you may have. 

Probably the simplest rule thai 
students should follow is to simply 
go to class. It feels almost dollish 
to mention this rule, but so many 
students don't follow it that it's 
almost necessary to repeat it 
incessantly. 

The best way lo sec this is to 
just look at how many people show 
up on a bright and sunny day. 

How much arc you going to 
learn by not going to classes and 
wasting the S300 you spent on the 



class? 

Next, realize that the Internet 
is your friend No matter how 
many books the Helmke Library 
gets il will never compare to ihe 
worldwide information thai is avail 
able over the Internet. 

Almost every professor accepts 
Internet sources, and mosl often 
you can find anything you want 
with just a few strokes of the keys. 

Buy the hooks for your class- 
es only after you have attended 
the class at least once No matter 
how convenient it may be to go to 
the bookstore ihe week before 
classes open, you may not need all 
of the books thai are on the shelves 
for your classes. 

Sometimes professors have 
alternate or extra books for the 



course that will appear on Ihe 
shelves at the bookstore, and most 
often those books aren't needed 

Hopefully, by following this 
rule we can help you save a few 
extra bucks. 

Lastly, even though this campus 
is mainly a commuter campus, you 
should try to find some group or 
organization to be a part of. 

If it be Students' Government, 
Student Activity Board (SAB), The 
Communicator (hint, hint). Magic 
the Gathering Club, Athletics, 
Greek organizations or any number 
of other groups, you should take an 
active part in your school. 

These arejustafew guidelines 
that we hope can help make your 
stay here at IPFW a very successful 
one. Good luck! 



Everyday 
Epiphanies . 

by 

Sail 

Ruble Crawford, 

Editor 



Welcome to IPFW. I would like 
lo extend a personal warm smile in 
your direction. 

I know that this fall may seem a 
long way off. but trust me, il will be 
here in ihe proverbial blink of an 
eye. You need to be ready. 

Yeah. 1 know, you just had a 
slew of "die besl lime of your life" 
and "do your besl" speeches for 
your high school graduation, but I 
hope that you realize that there real- 
ly was something lo those over-used 
metaphors. 

As a senior. I have some wis- 
dom mat I would like to share with 
you about making the mosl of your 
lime here at IPFW. 

I have learned many things in 
the lasi five years, and 1 hope thai 
you will take what I am about to 
share with you with more than a 
grain or sail. 

Recently I saw a television 
interview with au Ihor-c urn -drug - 
addict Hunter Thompson. 
Thompson's interview from last 
October was being played on PBS 10 
promolc a new movie based on his 
classic book. Fear and Loathing in 
Las Vegas. 

During the course of the inter- 
view, Thompson made a comment 
that struck me as extremely 
profound. 
When 
asked 
about 



"Dreams are 
faithful interpre- 
tations of our 
inclinations; 
but there is art 
required to sort 
and understand 
them. " 

—Michel 
De Montaigne 



interested 
in writing, 



be a 

wri ter; 

you have 
lo just BE 
a writer." 
The 
more that 
1 thought 
about that 
quote, (he 
more that I saw the significance of it 
in other areas of life, I philoso- 
phized. 

The whole poinl of Thompson's 
quote was this: Anyone can dream 
about doing things. 

We all have dreams about places 
dial we would like to go and goals 
dial we would like to accomplish. 

Most of the time, however, 
those dreams get lost along the way- 
side as we rush headlong into life's 
uncharted territory. 

Eventually, through the 
inevitable progression of thai nasty 
beast called Time, we realize what 
we lost, and start to regret lessening 
the importance of those early 
dreams. 

Thompson's quote was basical- 
ly advice on how to prevent ever 
reaching thai pitiful stage of regrets. 

To truly get anydiing done and 
to actually gel anywhere, it is neces- 
sary to, in Nike's immortal advertis- 
ing lingo, JUST DO IT! Don't sit 
around and talk aboui things that 
you could do. Do them. 

Your dreams won't come true 
by merely wishing mem to. 

You need to make them a reali- 
ty. You have the power within your- 
self lo make things happen if you 
create the opportunities necessary 
for reaching them. 

Set a realistic goal and find a 
way to get it accomplished. 

Don't be afraid to lake chances. 
either. You may find thai taking 
some crazy chance somewhere 
aJong the line may gel you closer to 
your goal than you ever thought 
possible. 

College is the perfect place lo 
figure out what your goals arc. 

It's also the perfect place to try 
new things. 

Whatever you conceive of it, 
jusi make sure that you don'l ignore 
your dreams. 

Twenty years from now. you 
don't warn to have a list of those 
"things I should have done."

Forensic League open to all students 



By Andrea Metteht 
News Editor 



Wbai do Arsenio Hall, 
Supreme Court Justice William 
Jennings Bryant, Marcia Clark, 
Shelly Long, Oprah and IPFW 
Communicaiion Department 
Chair John Parrish-S prowl all 
have in common? 

All of these people competed 
in forensic competition when 
they were in high school or 



"Many people here 
on campus have 
no idea that the 
speech team is 
available to them 
as students." 

-Sarah Nichter, Forensic 
League coach 



college. 

According lo Sarah Nichter, 
coach of the Forensic League, 
"Many people today feel thai 
their forensic experience has 
helped ihem with successful 
careers. Many famous people 
feci thai they gained their confi- 
dence from competing in foren- 
sic competition." 

Not only does the forensic 
league offer valuable experience 
to students of all majors, hut it 
also U a great chance lo interact 
with other students outside of the 
classroom and really gel 
involved with the IPFW 
community. 

For those of you whose 
hands get sweaty and knees 
buckle at (he mention of public 
speaking, Relax! 

The main goal of the forensic 
league is to have fun and take 
advantage of new experiences. 

Many people have the pre- 
conceived notion that joining the 
forensic league means nothing 
but a lot of extra work and time. 

"This is a lot different from 
the high school speech team. 
Everyone has family, work and 
kids to take care of," Nichter 
explains. 

Thai's why members of the 
learn have the opportunity, to 
choose which events they want lo 
participate in and decide their 



own degree of preparatidn. 

Members also get 10 choose 
from a variety of events. 

They can compete in Public 
Address (informative sneaking, 
persuasive speaking, after-dinner 
speaking, or rhetorical criticism): 
Oral Interpretation (dramatic 
interpretation, dramatic duo, 
poetry, prose, or program oral 
interpretation); or Limited 
Preparation (extemporaneous 
speaking or impromptu 
speaking). 

"We're going to have a really 
great team for the coming year 
already," said Nichter. 

Last year IPFW placed sev- 
enth in team sweeps and had 
three students who reached state 
finals: Geneva Burgess, sixth in 
Novice Prose; Lyneite Lewis, 
fifth in Prase; and Curtis Crisler, 
with partner Lynetie Lewis, third 
in Duo. 

Of those three, Lewis and 
Burgess were able to compete in 
the national finals. 

The finals were held over 
five days at Western Illinois 
University in April. 

"It was a fabulous experi- 
ence: they got lo meet people 
from the entire United Stales," 
said Nichter. 

Every student, even part 
time, is eligible to participate in 
the IPFW Forensic League. 



"Many people here on cam- 
pus have no idea that the speech 
learn is available to them as stu- 
dents," Nichter explained. 

Returning adults as well as 
new students are encouraged to 
join. In faci, there are already 
many returning adults on the 
team. 

You can even get one to four 
hours of communication credit 
from the communication depart- 
ment for your participation on 
the team, according to the 
amount of your involvement. 

There will be a workshop in 
August lo aid potential members 
in finding material and to offer 
helpful advice from current 
members. 

There will also be an open 
house on May 27 from 4-6 p.m. 
in Walb Fireside Lounge for 
those who want to listen to cur- 
rent members perform some or 
their pieces and learn more about 
the team at the same time. 

If you are interested in join- 
ing (he Forensic League or would 
like to know more aboul it, 
please contact Sarah Nichter at 
481-3834.

New year means new 
activities for SAB 



The beginning of a new academic 
year brings new ways to get involved 
on campus. 

The IPFW Student Activities 
Board (SAB) has a very diverse array 
of entertaining and educational activi- 
ties for students and the campus com- 
munity. 

With its purpose to integrate and 
expand the social, cultural and recre- 
ational activities for the student body, 
SAB is always trying to find ways to 
improve campus life. 

SAB provides a wide range of 
activities throughout the school year. 

Some ol the events this past year 
included comedy acts, a UFO lecture, a 
taste of Mexico. Vegas Night, 
Breakfast with 'Santa, and a Kids' 
Carnival. 

Upcoming events include Ihe 
Magic Schoolbus Live! show (June 
13). a trip to Cedar Point (July 22), 
and comedian Rondcll Sheridan 
(September 24). 

The Student Activities' Board is 
rebuilding under the leadership of its 
new president, Ryan Smith. 

Smith is looking for new members 
to help, particularly to bring new pro- 
gram ideas. 

He points out that joining SAB is 
an excellent experience for students. 

They get die opportunity to talk 
with performers and promotional man- 
agers, deal with contracts, and plan 
publicity. 



The mastodons? 

Where did that name come from, anyway? 



By Joan Poulsen 
Staff Writer 



When most people think aboul 
IPFW, ibey don't think of it as being 
big. 

Most Ihink of it as a small com- 
jmuter college in the middle of an 
Indiana town. But if you look at 
:some facts, IPFW is big. 

It is sealed in Indiana's second 
largest city, and is home to two Big 
Ten schools. 

It seems only fitting lhat IPFW's 
mascot for its athletic teams be big 
as well. And by far there could be 
few mascots larger than the 
mastodon. 

The American mastodont (the 
scientific phrase for what we refer to 
as Ihe mastodon) was a huge animal 
which lived during the Pleistocene 
era, the time from one million years 
ago to 50,000 years ago. 

This is the time when massive 
glaciers were shaping the land of 
Europe and North America 

These animals lived mostly in 
the southern Great Lakes region 
(including Fort Wayne) during the 



late Pleistocene era. and around the 
Atlantic Coast. 

The American mastodon is a 
close relative to the modem Asian 
elephant, and the resemblance is 
apparent physically. 

Mastodons could be as tall as 
ten feel at the shoulder, and had a 
coal of short, coarse brown hair. 

They had two tusks near their 
mouths to tear off branches and 
foliage from trees. ' 

Interestingly, these animals 
were either left-tusked or right- 
tusked. 

The mastodon which ultimately 
became IPFW's athletic team mas- 
cot was discovered in 1968. 

It was found on the Orsie 
Routsong farm thirty-five miles 
north of Fort Wayne when the owner 
found the bones while excavating a 
farm pond. 

Dr. Jack Sunderman initially 
identified the bones. 

He and others from IPFW's 
Department of Geoscienccs were 
called in to help with the excavation 
which received additional funding 
from the IPFW Student 
Government, 

The mastodon skeleton turned 
out lo be scattered over several hun- 



dred square feel. 

Once all of the bones were 
found, Routsong donated the skele- 
ton to IPFW for the purposes for 
research and for display. 

The bones were soaked in a 
solution of alcohol and shellac. 

The alcohol was used to dry out 
the bones which had been sitting in 
a wet pond bottom for thousands of 
years. The shellac was used as a 
preservative and hardener. 

As it lumed out, the Routsong 
mastodon was relatively young 
when it died. 

The age of the mastodon upon 
its death can be determined by 
examining the cheek teeth, or the 
grinding teeth in the jaw. 

As the mastodon's life progress- 
es, new leeth erupt from the back of 
the mouth and migrate forward. 

The oldest, and most worn teeth 
fall out of the front of the 
mastodon's mouth as the younger 
teeth push them out. 

The Routsong mastodon became 
IPFW's official mascot soon after its 
discovery. 

The original bones arc an exam- 
ple of how unique and large IPFW 
is, and continues to be, as the cam- 
pus grows and evolves.

Campus Ministry 
offers spiritual growth 



Campus Ministry seeks to provide a safe 
and stimulating place for students, staff and 
faculty at IPFW to explore their spirituality, 
investigate the possibility of a relationship 
with God and to nurture and nourish that rela- 
tionship if one is established. 

We also seek to encourage the growth of 
community on campus among those who par- 
ticipate in our activities. 

It is our desire to remind the academic 
community at IPFW on an ongoing basis that 
the secular and the sacred, reason and faith, 
must be held in balance in any honest intellec- 
tual search. 

At IPFW, or any other large college cam- 
pus, it is often difficult to find those people 
who really care or have the time to listen. 

One of our main objectives is to be a place 
where you can come if you need to talk. 

The campus minister, Ben Gates, has an 
office conveniently located on the third floor of 
Helmke Library. Rm. 362. 

He keeps regular office hours and can usu- 
ally be found on campus three full days each 
week. Gates invites you to stop in to meet him. 

You are welcome in his office, and at all 
campus ministry events or meetings, no matter 
what your religious convictions or beliefs. 

You will not be judged nor condemned for 
any ideas you bold or behaviors you practice. 

As a ministry to students, we offer Bible 
studies, special recreational and social events, 
opportunities to become involved in local and 
national service projects, ecumenical worship 



services on campus, special seminars, concerts 
on campus and an annual spring break work 
trip. 

We are very aware that the student body of 
IPFW is quite diverse and we desire to carry on 
a ministry that is uniquely tailored to meet the 
needs of the various types of students on 
campus. 

We constantly seek to provide programs 
and opportunities that are both helpful and 
hope-filled to all facets of (be campus 
community. 

Campus Ministry sponsors a unique lec- 
ture scries for IPFW students, staff and faculty 
known as the University Religious Forum 

A light lunch is provided at these forums, 
as well as the opportunity to interact on a series 
of important, contemporary issues. 

The URF will be held on the third 
Thursday of most months during the school 
year in Walb Union, Rm. 224. Watch for adver- 
tisement of these lectures throughout the com- 
ing year. 

For more information about Campus 
Ministry, contact Ben Gates on how you might 
participate in our activities or just to find a 
good, listening car, call 481-6992. 

You can also contact us at

Be sure to come by our offices on the third 
floor of Helmke Library to say hello!

Fine dining and world travel 
for a career? You bet! 



IPFW's Hotel, Restaurant 
and Tourism Management 
Program is a best-kept secret 
on campus. 

While it was founded in 
1976 as a two-year degree, few 
students know that it is in the 
process of becoming a four- 
year program. 

The hotel and restaurant 
business is exciting, but world 
tourism is expanding rapidly 
and all of these opportunities 
mean success for the IPFW 
graduate. 

"The time to check out this 
fantastic career is now," said 
John Knight, director of the 
program. 

"Besides the Dinner Scries, 
in which students experience 
fine dining throughout Fort 
Wayne while learning about 
management styles, the pro- 
gram features a Tour Series in 



which students attend hotel and 
restaurant shows in New York 
and Chicago and travel to Las 
Vegas and Wall Disney World 
to learn what tourism 
involves." 

Other excursions are 
planned throughout the acade- 
mic year through class work to 
help the student better under- 
stand the hospitality. 

The Hotel, Restaurant and 
Tourism Management Club 
involves students in additional 
opportunities such as catering 
proms, serving at elegant 
affairs and visiting restaurants 
to critique them 

Students who enjoy people, 
like to travel and are able to 
work hard should consider 
joining the club. 

New club officers for this 
coming year include Deb 
Schumm, president; Matthew 



Rosbrugh, vice president; 
Mary Savarcse, treasurer, and 
Steve Daniels, secretary. 

Students interested in 
learning more about the 
Program or Club should con- 
tact Knight or his secretary, 
Louise Pruse. at 481-6562. 

You can also contact either 
one of them at their offices in 
Neff Hall 330.

Fraternity welcomes freshmen 



Starting a new school can be hard, 
especially when it is college. 

Any incoming freshmen can be eas- 
ily overwhelmed by the curriculum, 
stress, and challenges that may affect 
them with such a vast change. 

In the midst of all of these concerns, 
Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity would like 
to welcome all incoming freshmen to 
campus. 

With the beginning of the fall 
semester, Sigma Phi Epsilon has 
planned a series of events to help stu- 
dents cope with the change and give 
them an excellent chance io meet other 
students already at IPFW. 

These events will be located in dif- 
ferent areas of campus and are designed 
to help the students enjoy, and get a 
great start for their first few weeks at 
IPFW. 

The events range from sand volley- 
ball to just hanging out on campus with 
music and fun. 

Everyone is welcome to attend these 
activities, and we are looking forward to 
seeing your there. 

Sigma Phi Epsilon Offers $250 Grant 

Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity strives 

to improve the Campus and Community. 

An example of this is the offer of our 
Balanced Man Scholarship. 

This is a S250 grant that will be 
awarded to an incoming freshman male 
at IPFW this fall. 

The scholarship will be awarded to 
the individual who best shows us that he 
has and is living a balanced life. 

This individual should be dedicated 
to academics, community, athletics, 
extracurricular activities, and other 
accomplishments in high school, 

"Animal House" Stereotype Doesn't 
Describe Sigma Phi Epsilon 
Fraternity 



Instead, we choose to draw our- 
selves from a positive image. 

With the addition of a new member 
development plan, Sigma Phi Epsilon 
doesn't make any member pledge. 

Instead, we start a member at a more 
equal level to the current brothers of the 
chapter, and move mem through several 
different stages until the member reach- 
es the most important goal, graduation. 
The plan is based upon goals set at 
the beginning of each stage, and helps 
each member strive to be the best he can, 
constantly improving himself. 

Through the friendships we make as 
members of Sigma Phi Epsilon, the 
great times wc have at social events and 
well-planned member development, this 
fraternity makes IPFW better. 

Striving to Make Balanced Leaders 
For Our Community 



lily is to grow and con- 
tinue to be prosperous, it must have 
well-trained and knowledgeable citizens 
to make it happen. 

Sigma Phi Epsilon strongly believes 
in incorporating this as an everyday pan 
of its member development plan. 

We do this by emphasizing Campus 



and Community First 

Campus includes specifically acade- 
mics. 

We are proud of the fact that we 
have earned several awards last year for 
having a chapter GPA above the campus 
average. 

The chapter GPA is die average GPA 
of the members of the Sigma Phi 
Epsilon chapter at IPFW. 

Also, when we say "campus first," 
it includes the numerous events we do 
on campus such as the Campus 
Mentoring Program. 

Sigma Phi Epsilon members also 
put community first by offering their 
time and talents to meaningful philan- 
thropic projects, such as the Imagination 
Station playgrounds they have helped 
build in and around the Fort Wayne area. 

With such a dedication to the 
improvement of our members, Sigma 
Phi Epsilon will continue to help Fort 
Wayne make itself a better community 

Should you have any additional 
questions please stop by our office in 
Walb 210D or stop by at any SOAR 
event this summer, or call Mike at 496- 
9088.

Hasenkamp. Sigma Phi Epsilon 
Fraternity 






At one point in time, fraternities bad 
a misdirected sense of what should be 
their members' priorities at college. 

Seeming more determined to under- 
mine the importance of academics and 
community service with drunken par- 
ties, blatant offenses of campus rules, 
and senseless hazings, fraternities 
earned a bad name. 

This is not Sigma Phi Epsilon.
