Coffee Break 

by Kim Coffey 




SADLV ENOUGH, THIS IS 

ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT 

HELPFUL TO ME. 




IPSGA Student Election Coverage 



By Luke Henkenius 

henkl1DieitudcnU.liilw.edu 



The Student Government election board held 
n meeting on Wednesday April 7"' in order to allow 
candidates Tor the upcoming elections to answer any Candidates running for this position include Ryan 



to the programs at 1PFW, Mathews answered she 
would strive to make IPFWfeel more like acommuni ty 
and hopes to make the students more involved in 
activities. 

Next the candidates running for President of the 
IPSGA were given theopportunityioanswer questions. 



questions students might have for them. 

First were the four candidates running for the 
position of Vice President of finance: Patrick Deady, 
Amanda McCann, Aimee Springer, and Eric Smith; 
along with the candidate for V.P. of Programming: 
Niki Mathews. Those running 
for V.P of finance were asked 
what they would do to make 
money more available to 
students. Smith supported 
the idea of getting the student 
organizations more involved 

and helping them in being aware that there is money Lynn believes that the i 

available. Springer built onto this idea by stating that more people to participate next year than this year, 
student organizations should be aware of money for and would hold meet and greets in order to get to 
travel so that they can take back the things they learn know the student body more personally. Mann states 
from other campuses and trips, Deady, on the other that he will attempt to embody the student body as a 
hand, supported using student surveys to see what whole, and would do so by meeting with the officers 
students want, and then using that information to of the individual student organizations, and finding 
help give students more precisely what they want. what they want. Finally, Motter holds that he will have 

When asked what she would do to draw attention an open door policy to allow students to come and 



Humberson believes in order 

to reach efficiency the student 

government should be able to 

change flexibly." 



Houck, Mathew Lash, Terel Lynn, Arthur Mann, and 
Thomas Motter. Presidential candidates were asked 
about their vision for the student government as well 
as how they would decide upon their policies. 

Houck answered that he would strive to let 
every student know about 
the student government, 
and that he would utilize 
as much advertising as 
passible to help this happen, 
while using random surveys 
to see what students want. 
important thing is getting 



talk to him, while at the same time being involved in 
the various student organizations. 

Finally, students running for VP. of Legislation 
took their seats at the front of the room to answer 
questions. Only three were able to make it: Anthony 
Decker, Jonathan Humberson, and DeAngelo 
LaVette, although a video recording was played so 
that students were able to hear what the absent 
Shante Smith had to say about her candidacy as well. 
These students were asked what their goals were in 
order to reach maximum efficiency for next year. 
Decker believes although the legislation already runs 
efficiently, making the student body more aware that 
they can affect things such as parking and campus 
beautification will always help. Humberson believes 
in order to reach efficiency the student government 
should be able to change flexibly with the student 
body, and a broader viewpoint and transparency 
within the senate will affect change. LaVette, who has 
had experience in the student government, implores 
students to realize it is, in reality, a process, and it is 
already more efficient than it has been in past years, 
but by using the resources we have on campus to 
gather information from students, we can improve. 
Smith advocates using organizations and orientation 
programs that are easily accessible to students in 
order to make them more aware of opportunities 
they have available. 



Student Senate meets to discuss student housing 



By Luke Henkenius 

henkltOI Oiiudmlk lplw.edu 



Monday March 29"' the student 
senate held a meeting to discuss is- 
sues with the 1PFW campus housing, 
at which residents were given the op- 
portunity to come forward with any- 
thing they felt needed to be discussed. 

One problem noted by students 
is that some of their RAs do not seem 
openly available. Al though there is al- 
ways someone either in the office or 
on call, students noted that they don't 
feel very comfortable calling them 
while they are out of the office. An- 



other suggestion made was that there 
should be a better rating system in 
place. Although there are evaluations 
that ask general questions about the 
staff, there is no individuated evalua- 
tion. 

Another problem some students 
have been having is with their inter- 
net's ability to access online gam- 
ing. Although they are not having 
any trouble with accessing from their 
computers, they have been having 
difficulty with online services such as 
X-box live. 

Also, there is currently a restriction 
on bringing alcohol into the apart- 
ments and some students who are 



over the age of 21 feel as though they 
should be able to responsibly drink 
within their own rooms. 

Security was another issue. Stu- 
dents have had their cars vandalized 
and have asked that some action be 
taken to prevent this from happening. 

Many students also have a problem 
with the curfew set by student hous- 
ing for visitors. Currently, if a resident 
wants to have a friend stay past 8 p.m. 
they must first inform someone at the 
housing office. Furthermore, there 
have been issues with nonresidents 
being hassled by the campus police 
for being there late at night. 

One last issue that students have 



was with their contracts. Students 
complained that they were not able 
to see a copy of the lease without first 
giving a down payment. Furthermore, 
if a student decides they don't want to 
stay, only a portion of the money is 
refunded. Also, if a student does sign 
the contract, and then later decides 
to cancel it, they are subject to a $400 
dollar cancellation fee as well as being 
responsible for paying the remainder 
of the rent for their contract until an- 
other person is found to fill the room. 
One student also complained that 
housing can force residents to move 
to different buildings midway through 
the lease at a moment's notice.

WtuttisRSS? 

RSS is a way to check all the blogs, 
sites, and news stories that you want 
to read, without having to visit every 
single site every day to see if there 
has been an update. By offering an 
RSS feed, a publisher, such as the 
IPFW Communicator, can deliver 
new stories and articles to the 
reader's digital inbox easily. The 
acronym stands for "Really Simple 
Syndication," which basically means 
that it is really simple to subscribe to 
an RSS feed. 

How to use RSS. 

Using RSS is as simple as choosing 
an RSS reader and subscribing to 
some feeds. Most e-mail clients such 
as Outlook or Thunderbird offer RSS 
subscription, but one of the best RSS 
readers available is Google Reader, 
accessible for free to anybody with a 
Gmail account at www.google.com/ 
reader. Google Reader is accessible 
from any computer with internet 
access, so it can be used anywhere, 
and has a mobile version for reading 
from a smartphone. To add a feed to 
an RSS reader, click on a site's RSS 
feed link, which usually has a icon 
of white radio waves on an orange 
background. This will usually bring 
up a preview of the feed, which will 
contain some recendy published 
posts, and the option to subscribe 
to the feed. To subscribe to the feed 
with a different newsreader than the 
default, copy and paste the feed's 
URL, in the other newsreader by 
using the "add" button. 



After setting up a feed, It won't 
need to be added again. Every time 
the RSS reader is opened, it will check 
the website to see if there have been 
any new updates, and then shows 
these updates to the user. 

Why RSS? 

RSS is useful for college students 
because it saves time and bandwidth. 
By letting the RSS reader check all the 
blogs, news sites, and other feeds, 
the user is free to spend more time 
reading what is important, rather 
than manually going to each site, and 
waiting for it to load. Furthermore, 
RSS can save bandwidth hy only 
loading the articles, rather than the 
entire page for each article. 

Most modem blogs, and 
news sites, such as the IPFW 
Communicator, offer RSS feeds. The 
abundance of RSS feeds avalible 
means that for many people, an 
RSS reader can make reading the 
internet's offerings easier and more 
efficient. 




Smoke Hut Diaries 



By Robin Crowell 

robinyouianrtO^njIl torn 



I've spent a lot of time calling 
people out on their shortcomings, 
and though I always thought that I 
was aware of my own, I've recently 
figured out that this wasn't the case. 
There was a guy in the hut a while 
ago that called me out on being, well, 
a bitch. I didn't argue it, I just refuted 
it by saying that I didn't like him. This 
is common practice in Robin's offic- 
es- People have also called me out on 
my complaining about Fort Wayne 
and for that I had no response. 

I went to Portland, Oregon over 
spring break and did a lot of searching 
withinmyselfforananswer. Towhat 
question? I wasn't sure. By Tuesday 
of spring break, it hit me.We traveled 
to Seattle which was around two and 
a half hours away from Portland. We 
had no agenda, no plan, no worries. 
We just wanted to explore the city 
and see what it was all about. Being 
from the Midwest leaves the larger 
cities out west a little further out of 
reach than say, Chicago. We searched 
around an old antique store, ate fresh 
seafood on the bay, roamed around 
Pike Place Market, then proceeded 
to drive around. It was then that we 
found The Funhouse. I kid you not; 
the place was called The Funhouse. 

From the distance we saw a giant 
scary clown head on top of a building 
and as we neared the building there 
was a banner on the side that read 
"$1 PBR." This was our place. We set- 
tled into the bar and had a few drinks 
and proceeded to walk outside to the 
back porch to smoke. We looked up 
and saw none other than the Space 
Needle itself looming above us, star- 
ing us down, begging us to awe in its 
presence. 



As we peered up through smoke 
clouds, the Space Needle's glow il- 
luminating the back porch, conver- 
sation started to ensue about what 
we were really doing with our lives. 
I have been trying to get out of Fort 
Wayne for years but to no avail. Ev- 
ery avenue I'd tried to travel down 
had closed and 1 have never felt more 
stuck or suffocated in my entire life, 
A friend of mine, in the hut no less. 
spoke of such suffocation and I wrote 
it off. I thought that if other attempts 
fail, the only other option is to make 
the best of the circumstances you are 
allotted. 1 tried this, but my allotted 
circumstance was less than admi- 
rable. 

Not only was Fort Wayne suffocat- 
ing me, but school as well. I value an 
education, very very much so. Hon- 
est. But upon thinking about it, I've 
been a resident In academic for the 
last eighteen years straight of my life. 
I'm burned out. It was after coming 
to this realization that my boyfriend 
and I decided to just up and leave, to 
move to Portland. This isn't a matter 
of running away, this isn't a matter of 
hiding from my problems. This is a 
matter of finally doing something for 
me and to stop worrying about the 
happiness of others. 

So, this is my formal announce- 
ment to all of my faithful readers. 
I'm moving to Portland on May 10 ,h . 
These next few smoke hut diaries will 
be the last of the lot, but it was a good 
run. If it wasn't for writing this, if it 
wasn't for the people that I've actu- 
ally started paying attention to, the 
people that 1 started listening to, and 
the people that I absolutely loathe... 
who knows if this would have hap- 
pened or not. You meet everyone for 
a reason, you write every word for a 
reason, and every cigarette smoked 
with you people was for a reason. 



The Stop Dating Show 



By Wil Upchurch &amp; Bernadette Gleeson 



I'm adopting the Stop Dating philosophy In my 
everyday interactions, but I'm finding It difficult 
to describe to people what's happening in my life. 
When someone asks me on a date, what should I tell 
my friends? What terms should I use with people 
that don't yet subscribe to Stop Dating? Give me a 
vocabulary, pi easel 

—Jazmine, Indiana 

Well, we're obviously partial to the idea of spending 
time. What's wrong with just telling people you're 
going to spend time with someone? If you are adopting 
the Stop Dating philosophy, then this will become 
more natural over time. However, as you've probably 
noticed, people have a hard time accepting ambiguous 
answers. They wan t to know the juicy details! And that's 
totally natural and benign. ..your friends want to be 
excited with you. This is probably how you've always 
communicated about these things, and so it's going to 
take time. 

We like to talk about how we teach others how to 
treat ourselves, and this is no different. Friends tend

The Stop Dating Show! or go to

to develop their own languages, so if you're one of 
the first in your group to subscribe to the Stop Dating 
philosophy, then you're going to have to take the lead 
in changing the way you and your friends talk about 
the connections you're making with others. 

This is an opportunity to point out that the Stop 
Dating philosophy isn't just about how things affect 
you. but about how the things you say affect others. We 
know dating is a loaded word, so what other kinds of 
things can you say? Well, you can describe what you're 
going to do. "Cam and I are going to play Putt- Putt." You 
can use more generic phrases that indicate the level of 
intimacy or closeness that you're comfortable with. For 
example, saying you're going to share moments with 
someone might seem more inornate than just saying 
you're going to hangout. 

The point we're trying to make is that it's ok... 
no, it's beneficial... to use more descriptive language 
that indicates where you're at today. The way that 
we talk affects the way that we think, and vice versa, 
and both eventually affect the way we behave, even 
at a subconscious level. So, choose words that more 
precisely describe what you're doing and how you 
feel about it instead of using the generic language of 
dating.

rather private matter. 

VIRGO (Aug. 23 Sept. 23) Try to be fair in your dealings

theft are evident this week. You could meet an interesting 
individual you'll want to get to know better.

Upon walking into the 
ceramics room in the Visual Arts 
building, one will generally see 
senior Debbie Ngo working on 
her latest project. When walking 
through the building, one is able 
to view the senior projects from 
the students pursuing Bachelor 
degrees in Fine Arts. Ngo's 
concentration is in sculpture. She 
has worked with many materials 
ranging from found objects to 
metal to clay. She is currently 
working with clay to create a 
bust of a man with earrings and 
a cigarette hanging from his lips. 
Ngo used many varying tools, 
including an everyday spoon, to 
create lines in his hair, sculpt his 
jaw line, and further detail litde 
aspects of his face. 



Ngo grew up in Fort Wayne 
and, unlike many of her fellow 
college students, she wouldn't 
mind ending up here. What she 
does isn't found here frequently, 
so it would be a chance for her 
to expose Fort Wayne to different 
types of art. When asked if she was 
considering attending graduate 
school to pursue her masters 
degree (and perhaps teach), Ngo 
mentioned that "that's pretty 
much all" she could do with it. 
She would, however, like to come 
back to Fort Wayne (after perhaps 
attending graduate school) and 
set up a studio or a workshop and 
she'd definitely consider teaching 
a few classes that way. So far the 
schools Ngo has looked at are 
in Chicago and California, but, 
again, she's not entirely sure she 
wants to go the graduate school 
route. 

While watching Ngo work. 



a classmate approached and 
asked if this was another one 
of her "characters," to which 
she responded that he, in fact, 
was. After a few more minutes 
of simply watching, i asked Ngo 
what her classmate had meant 
by characters — did she base 
all her art on characters? She 
responded that she wrote when 
she was younger and now that 
she's into the arts, she takes those 
characters and gives them a real 
face. She based the characters 
on people from her life. She said 
she would sometimes even base 
a character on a group of people. 
Ngo and her classmates have 
their Senior Bachelor of Fine Arts 
Show up on display until April 
11. After being in the Visual Arts 
Building and looking at many of 
the amazing projects, I can safely 
say it is well worth the short walk 
to the Visual Arts Building.

Do you remember Clueless? Do you remember 
how popular a movie it was? Furthermore, do 
you remember how flighty all the characters were 
(with the notable exception of Josh)? Would you 
be shocked to realize that it was based on lane 
Austen's Emma? Upon reading the book for a class 
this semester and discussing this article with a 
sibling, the movie Clueless was instantly brought 
up. With dawning comprehension. I realized that 
losh was Mr. Knightly. Dionnc was Mrs. Weston, 
and Cher was none other than Emma Woodhouse 
herself. The movie puts a very modern rwist on the

This fun physics game is well polished and a 
good value. There is a pretext of a story, something 
about the birds' eggs being stolen by green pigs, 
but it doesn't distract from the gameplay. 

It plays like the flash game "Crush the Castle," 
but with better controls. Rather than being a 
timing-based challenge, the usei chooses the 
trajectory of the titular birds with simple drag and 
release controls. The controls are usually fine, 
but sometimes a bit dificult to use, espcscially 
for low power or high angle shots, but these don't 
come up very often. There is a great variety of 
"ammunition", including standard birds, birds 
that explode, and birds that lay eggs, just to name 
a few. The graphics are whimsicle without being 
distracting, which is good since the you'll be 
looking at the screen for a long dme as you play 
through trough the 105 levels that this game has. 
This is a great casual game, as even the most 
challenging levels take no more than few minuites 
to clear.

This strategy game has the user capturing 
much of a field of hexagonal spaces as possible. 
The Al will do the same. Whoever has more when 
the field is full wins. The game's simple control 
schema matches its simple objective, click a hex to 
make it your color, click on it again to crystallize 
it, and capture all the hexes around it. Once a 
cell bus been captured, it can only be convened 
by crystallizing a hex next to it. Once a hex has 
been crystallized, it can never be converted 
again. This complication to the otherwise simple 
game concept makes strategy and forethought an 
important part winning. However, every game is 
differvut, due to the addition of special powerups 
that can change the game in an instant. The game 
is easy to play, and is a lot of fun for people who 
like strategy games like Risk. The graphics are 
simpk'. but that just makes everything clearer. The 
only major problem with this game is that hexes 
are a bit smaller than most people's ingers, and 
it's possible to pick the wrong hex by mistake. The

though, these are obstacles in the future. Your 
marble has to dodge lazer guns, go through 
lazer gates, and move past the obligatory slowly 
rotating spiked fan which seems out of place in 
this game, as it is not made out of lazers. The 
controls use the accelerometer, and are more 
responsive than most other games of the kind; 
tilt forward to move forward, tilt left to move 
left, etc. The marble responds quite snappily, 
which is good, since some of the levels involve 
jumpingand changing direction in mid-air. The 
game's 10 levels are each unique, with difficulty 
scaling smoothly across the game. The game's 
graphics are very impressive; they make the 
game fun to look at, without distracting the 
player or making the setting unnecessarily 
complex. This game is not a game of strategy or 
planning. It is a game that is about reflexes and 
fine motor control.

REVIEWS 



Photo by www.winnipegfolklcitiv, 




Murder By Death has never 
failed to impress through their 
string of albums speaking 
about the apocalypse, drunken 
mistakes, and heartache; all 
executed with swank, class, 
and bellowing vocal styles 
accompanied by gracefully 
orchestrated cello and rock 
music reminiscent of what 
Johnny Cash mating with the 
old southwest would sound 
like. 

This album is no exception, 
though the themes seem kissed 
with a slight ray of hope. The 
songs come across as less 
doomsday-oriented and more 
focused on having a good time. 
Also, the album sounds older. 



It sounds less produced, less 
clean, bui happier nonetheless, 
The lighter tones 

implemented, especially on 
tracks like "As Long As There's 
Whiskey In The World" and 

"Foxglove," draw a different 
tone entirely into the mix, 
but it's welcomed. Tracks go 
back to signature MBD sound, 
especially prevalent on "You 
Don't Miss Twice (When You're 
Shavin' With A Knife) which is 
almost cartoony in nature, and 

"Piece By Piece" which has that 
mournful essence creeping 
around in singer Adam Turla's 

The feel has changed, but the 
talent has in no way dissipated. 
If anything, this shows that the 
band is maturing in both writing 
and musical composition. 
There is beauty, ugliness, 
disgust, optimism, and love 
bleeding through every pore 
of this album. Always intense, 
never boring, and a solid listen 
all the way through... this will 
easily be one of the best albums 
of the year.

STUDENT ISSUES 



P. 9 



Texting and driving 

Letter to the Editor 



Dear Editor, 

We are tomorrow's leaders and to- 
day's change agents. As college stu- 
dents, we are the individuals who are 
watching our future change before 
our eyes in the midst of a social meta- 
morphosis. Not only has the economy 
changed our idea of financial stability 
and social networks changed our idea 
of interpersonal relationships, but 
these changes also accompany the 
onset of new societal weaknesses. 

These weaknesses include new 
addictions to, not drugs, but mobile 
connectivity. iPhones, smart phones, 
netbooks, WiFi, iPods, cell phone ver- 
satilities and other gadgets have be- 
come as common as pencils and car 
keys. And, unfortunately, our increas- 
ing need to feel connected has led us 
to ignore safety precautions so that we 
not only check email and text messag- 
es but also respond to these messages 
as well. 

As communication majors, we 
unanimously recognize the value of 
communicating with others. How- 
ever, in no way are messages sent via 
telephones dire enough to risk the 
safety of those in our cars or those 
driving among us. This is why Lamb- 
da Pi Eta, the Department of Commu- 
nication's Honor Society, is enthusias- 
tically committed to partnering with 
Parkview Health Trauma Center to 
champion their "Don't Text &amp; Drive" 
campaign. We've worked with various 
venders, IPFW and Parkview repre- 



sentatives to post flyers and hand out 
lanyards, key chains and air freshen- 
ers to provide constant reminders to 
IPFW students. We hope that these ef- 
forts will help encourage students to 
put down the phone while their driv- 
ing and break this distractive and de- 
structive habit. 

Bringing the "Don't Text &amp; Drive" 
message to IPFW's campus was par- 
ticularly important to us because we 
know that students frequently juggle 
responsibilities at work, home, school 
and elsewhere. Because a large popu- 
lation of IPFW's student body com- 
mutes, we feel this message is entirely 
relevant to the habits many of us have 
unconsciously fallen into. 

Texting while driving can be a fatal 
decision and is ending lives, youngand 
old. In fact, a recent study conducted 
by the Virginia Tech Transportation 
Institute found that texting while driv- 
ing increased the driver's collision risk 
23 times that of drivers who don't text 
and drive. We understand and fully 
relate to students' desire to want to 
achieve, accomplish, and manage a 
to-do list. But those tasks and respon- 
sibilities will be waiting for us at our 
destinations. This is our plea to IPFW 
students, and to drivers everywhere: 
Put down the phone; Don't Text and 
Drive. 

Sincerely, 

Members of Lambda PI Eta, Psi 
Omega, IPFW Communication Hon- 
or Society

March Madness Final Four 

Thanks to our sponsors Ziffles Bar and Grill and Coney Island 



By Lucas Fisher 



March Madness was three greal weekends of bas- 
ketball, just like what was predicted. In round one of 
the tournament Old Dominion upset Notre Dame 
51-50, Villanova survived a huge upset beating Rob- 
ert Morris in overtime 73-70, Wake Forest pulled one 
out against Texas winning 81-80, Washington upset 
Marquette 80-78, Murray Slate upset Vanderbilt with 
a buzzer beater winning 66-65, BYU survived against 
Florida winning 99-92 in two overtimes, and Ohio 
beat Georgetown in the first rounds biggest upset win- 
ning 97-83. In the second round of weekend number 
one; Purdue beat Texas A&amp;M late in overtime 63-61, 
St. Mary's stunned Villanova winning 75-68, Cornell 
continued their Cinderella story beating Wisconsin 
B7-69. Xavier won late to beat Pittsburgh 71-68, But- 
ter held off Murray State to win 54-52, Michigan State 
scored a three at the buzzer to beat Maryland 85-83, 
and Northern Iowa shocked the world upsetting the 
favorite Kansas 69-67. 

Weekend number two saw a great sweet sixteen 
and elite eight. Butler upset Syracuse 63-59, Kansas 
State survived two overtimes to beat Xavier 101-96. 
Kentucky dominated Cornell 62-45 ending their Cin- 
derella story, Michigan State knocked out Northern 
Iowa 59-52, and Tennessee knocked off Ohio State 76- 
73. In the elite eight; Butler once again shot the ball 



lights out to upset Kansas State 63-56, West 
Virginia held off Kentucky to win 73-66, 
Michigan State beat Tennessee 70-69 with 
late free throws and Duke survived against 
No. 3 Baylor to win 78-71. 

In weekend number three it was the fi- 
nal four and the championship. In the first 
game Butler held off Michigan State win- 
ning 52-50 after hitting late free throws 
and Duke dominated West Virginia 78-57 
after the Mountaineers lost top playci 
Da'Sean Butler to a torn ACL. 

In the championship it was Cin- 
derella and home crowd favorite But- 
ler against the team everyone loves 
to hate, Duke. At halftime Duke was 
leading 33-32. Late in the game with 
only 3 minutes to go, Duke had the lead 
60-55 but could not close the door on 
Butler. Butler came back in the final two 
utes to be down by one, 60-59. Butler's star Hayward 
missed a shot with three seconds to go. Duke went to 
the line and they made the first but missed the sec- 
ond. Hayward of Butler got the rebound and went 
down court to put up a prayer from half court but 
the ball bounced out of the basket. DUKE wins the 
NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP 61-59. Duke's Kyle Singler 
was named most outstanding player. 

What a game, what a tournament, 1 can't wait until 
next year! 




Congratulations to the winner of 

our March Madness challenge:

Patience is a virtue 

Volleydons taste victory after 5 consecutive losses 



By Logan Pea 

e.i II 01 wsiudcms.lplw.edu 



Losing Streak-an uninterrupted string of contests 
(whether games, matches, etc.) lost by a team or 
individual. 

A losing streak can last as short as two games or it 
can last as long as an entire season, if not longer. In 
NCAA Division 1 Football, .the Northwester Wildcats 
from the powerhouse BigTen conference lost a record 
thirty-four games in a row before picking up a win. 
If you want to look at basketball, NJIT Highlanders, 
a familiar foe of the volleydons once dropped fifty- 
one games in a row. which is over two entire seasons. 
Lucky for us, there were no losing streak records that 
have been spat out by IPFW, and if I know one tiling, 
the Dons would like to do anything possible to stay 
off this list. 

When it comes to Men's Volleyball, losing streaks 
aren't often seen on the Win/Loss columns; so when 
IPFW rolled into the Gates Center Saturday night af- 
ter losing five consecutive matches, it was lime to pull 
it togedierfora team victory. Because, of course, we 
all know what happened the last time the Volleydons 
lost five consecutive matches-the 2009 season ended 
at the hands of Loyola Chicago in the MIVA tourna- 
ment. 

Saturday night's match against the King College 
Tornado's proved KC to be anything but Tornado's. 
Or Kings. The Tornado's spun in and out of Gates 
before they knew what hit them. They were beaten 
and bruised by the Dons In four sets. (30-25. 30-24, 
26-30, 30-23) As a leader who has seemed to step up 
all season, junior outside hitter Darryl Shank led the 
dons with twenty-seven kills on the evening, followed 
by freshman Lion Fyficld with seventeen kills, and se- 
nior Oliver Kook with thirteen kills and a .500 hitting 
percentage. Not a bad night to be a Volleydon. 

Unfortunately, there are no more opportunities to catch 
IPFW on home turf this season. The Dons wrap up the sea-

Sports Update 



Who needs 
football? 



By Logan Pea 

purrtlOiIudenU. Ip tw «Ju 

After a long week of classes, with stress 
mounting, students will do almost anything to 
take out that stress. After all, it is the weekend. 
But on this campus, there's a group of about 
twenty guys who get together once a week to 
take out stress a little different than most oth- 
ers. It's called rugby. 

Rugby, not to be confused with the simi- 
lar sport, football, is played in a field called a 
"pitch." The pitch is one-hundred meters, not 
yards, long, and sixty-nine meters wide. The 
sidelines are called touchlines and there are 
two tn-goa! areas which are expected to be ten 
to twenty-two meters deep with a tryline mark- 
ing the front and a dead ball line at the back. 

Although that game is similar to football, the 
padding is not. The players all were helmets, 
but no face masks, and there are no shoulder 
pads. 

The. goal posts are located on the try line 
and are 5.6 meters apart with a crossbar set at 
three meters, (the goal post resemble that of 
a football field.) The height of the posts varies 
according to how that particular team wants 
them. 

Well, now that the technical stuff is out of 
the way, it's time to get to the real reason why 
people play the sport-"the hitting." For a little 
insight on why someone might want to get 
tossed around for a few hours, I talked to the 
one guy that I'm pretty sure was born for the 
sport, freshman Steve Kemper. The kid practi- 
cally has "Rugby Player" tattooed across in fore- 
head. 

You know the type; homegrown, pickup- 
truck driving, cam-fed, football playing, mud- 
covered, trouble-making kid who couldn't even 
run up and down the basketball court with- 
out planting someone on their-well, you get 
the point. The guy could turn a simple game 
of hop-scotch into a full blown smackdown. I 
would know, 1 grew up with him. 

When I asked the guy they call Kemper why 
he played the game, 1 got the answer I knew was 
coming. 

"It's high contact! We don't get to play foot- 
ball here and it's good to get some exercise and 
get to hit people at the same time. It's new to 
me, I enjoy meeting new people, and it's just a 
fun sport to play." 

I asked Kemper why people would want to 
come watch a Rugby match, and he made it 
sound simple. 

"People should watch because it's nice to 
have support and it's a fun game to watch. Es- 
pecially if you like hitting! If you like watchin' 
football, you'll like watchin' rugby."
