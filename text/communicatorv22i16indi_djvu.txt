Gulf facts 

Allies employ high-tech aircraft in combat 



unfold 

often used without further explanation. Here is a brief guide to 

the most frequently mentioned weapons. 

F-H7A Stealth Fighter This is a night attack jet manned by a 
single pilot. The stealth is nearly invisible to radar because of 
its layer of radar-absorbing material and the angle of its body 
panels. The stealth uses a highly accurate laser-guided system 
for bombing. There are more than 40 of these fighters in the 
gulf. 

F-in Fighter-Bomber This is a tactical strike aircraft that 
flies at supersonic speeds. The F-lll can fly low to the ground 
as well as up to 60,000 feet. The agile F-lll was used in the 
bombing of Libya in 1986. It is manned by a crew of two. There 
are approximately 70 of these crafts in the gulf. 



F-4G Advanced Wild Weasel This is a two-person modmed 
version of the Phantom II fighter. The Wild Weasel is set up 
with special missiles foi neutralizing enemy radar defenses. 
There are 24 of these jets in the gulf. 

Several smaller fighter aircraft are also used by the allied 
forces in the gulf. The United States uses the F-16 Falcon, a 
fighter and bomber; the A-6E Intruder, an attack jet; the 
Grumman E-2C Hawkeye, a carrier; and the F/A Hornet, a 
Navy fighter/bomber and a Marine fighter/escort. 

Allied forces offer an Italian Tornado, a long-range inter- 
ceptor, and the United Kingdom's Jaguar, an attack jet. 

Another U.S. jet playing an important role in the gulf war is 
the aged B-52 Bomber. The B-52 has been around since 1952. The 
bomber has been dropping conventional bombs on the targets in 
Iraq but it is capable of carrying nuclear bombs as well as 
cruise missiles. There are 50 B-52s currently in the gulf. 

According to Allied reports as of Tuesday night, 17 of the 
planes previously described have been lost in combat. Iraq 
claims to have downed 160 allied aircraft.
