Yean of interpersonal conflict 
among the faculty of the IPFW School 
of Business and Management Sciences. 
(SDMS) precipitated a lawsuit Hied in 
U.S. District Court 1 ... i week. 

George Bullion and Thomas 
Gulhric, associate professors of eco- 
nomics, and Frederick Crowley, associ- 
ate professor of finance, ate suing 
Indiana University, its Board of 
Trustees, former I.U. President Thomas 
Ehrlicb, Chancellor Joanne Lantz, for- 
mer Visiting Dean of SBMS James 
Dunlap, David Dills, professor of mar- 
keting and management, and Patrick 
Ashton, professor of sociology and 
anthropology and chairman of (be 
Faculty Board of Review. 

In the lawsuit, legal counsel for the 
three tenured professors alleges that 
Bullion's, Guthrie's and Crowley's con- 
stitutional rights to due process have 
been denied, and all seek "declaratory 
ond/or injunctive relief, money dam- 
ages, and an award of attorney's fees 
and cosls." 

Counsel for the plaintiffs claim that 
the conflict in SBMS began when Dilts 
"brought forth a scries of unwarranted 
grievances against then-Dean Bullion in 



an effort to discredit Bullion and reduce 


tion. Bullion and Guthrie do not auto-

"One criticism that exists within the

of sent directly to those graduate 



(IPFW)." according the report itself. 

The Center for Higher Education 
Management concluded several prob- 
lems exist regarding decision-making 
structure and processes at IPFW:

Hollander, professor

Hollander staled to Tbe 
Communicator that this is one of the 
few complaints many individuals at 
IPFW have with West Lafayette. 

Those involved in sending pro- 
posed graduate programs to West 
Lafayette, have expressed concern with 
the process in which Purdue evaluates

said Hollander 

Recently The Commission for 
Higher Education Management 
Systems requested the National Center 
for Higher Education Management 
Systems to conduct a study. 

The primary goal of the center was 
"to study all matters related to the 
increased academic and fiscal autono- 
my of Indiana University Fort Wayne 



Tbe uncertainty of the mis- 
if IPFW, conflicting philosophies 
nulti-campus university, and a 



ambiguous executive leadership have 
led to uncertainties about the academic 
and fiscal autonomy; 

♦ Primary accountability of the 
campus leadership lies solely with the 
chancellor of West Lafayette; 

IPFW remains 

underreprcsented in the senior 

policy-making process at the 

Lafayette campus.

place in the "Best Overall Newspaper i 
the Division D Weekly" category. The 
1993 awards were announced April 30. 

In this category, judges looked at 
editorial content, writing, page layout 
design, copy editing — all aspects of 
news publishing.

DePauw University. Greencastle. 
Indiana. 

Newspapers, magazines and year-

gories throughout Indiana. 

Determination of the Newspaper.

the editorial categories. A publication 
received three points for a first place,

Gcdda Slarlin, president of Tbe 
Communicator Publications Board said 
she was happy to see The 
Communicator win this prestigious 
award and is interested in seeing tbe 
paper do well. 

Starlin also staled the paper is so 
Important to the needs of the campus, 
and that everyone on campus should be 
pleased by tbe awards. She feels that 
without The Communicator, there is no 
communication on campus. 

Id Slarlin's opinion, activities and 
politics are important to the campus 
because, otherwise, students would be 
closed off to the world. 

"Besides having a busy schedule of 
work and school, students should be 
able to plan in advance for activities 
such as a recent pizza party that was not 
widely advertised." Slarlin said. 

"We don'l know what student gov- 
ernment is doing unless The 
Communicator covers it," said Slarlin. 

"The students have no other way of 
being informed on the issues of a com- 
muter campus," Slarlin added. "It is so 
urgent that we should inform students 
of events on campus." 

Slocks swepi up the competition 
with a total of eight awards to ber credit 
this year. She has been a frequent win- 
ner tn past IPCA competitions. 

"I am thrilled tbat I was able to 
bring this honor to the Communicator." 
said Slocks. "Winning at IPCA is 
always exciting." 

Michael A. Wartell. newly-elected 
chancellor, expressed surprise at hear- 
ing of the award, bul said he was 
delighted to learn of iL 

"No oewspaper can rest on its bu- 
rets. Every newspaper has to get bet- 
ter." Wartell added. ♦

Wartell shares mission 

An interview 



"I took my concerns to Dunlap, To 
my recollection, be disallowed the 
bylaws almost immediately." 

Richard E Hill, associate professor 
of marketing and management (retired), 
explained tbe events leading up to the 
grievances filed by Dilts against 
Bullion. 

"Bullion was appointed dean by a 
vice chancellor with no search or 
screen, which is contrary to university 

"Bullion brought Dilts on board. He 
had been very close to Dills, but when 
ibeir departments split, they had a 
falling-out. 

"They were both aggressive leaders, 
and ihcy formed cliques. Now two 
cliques arc battling over the power, 

I think the thing is a farce and a 
waste of university resources." Hill 
slated. 

Bullion was not the only member of 
SBMS who had grievances levied 
jgainsi him, according to Hill. 

Hill personally bad filed on age dis- 
crimination grievance against Dills, and 
added that he knew of at least three 
other professors within SMBS who 
filed grievances or had grievances filed 
against Ihem over the last eigbl years. ♦

Pyrotechnics and other forms of pest control 



When my husband and I got mar- 
ried, we immediately nought a house. 
Neither of ui bad ever owned a borne, 
to we didn'l know anything about 
borne maintenance and repair. We 
could lell a tree from a bush, I sup- 
poie, but not a maple from an oak. 
We certainly did not know how much 
time, money, and sanity wc would 
pour into landscaping our home. 

Landscaping, in fact, is a high art 
form. Anyone who tells you otherwise 
Is not to be trusted, especially not with 
gardening implements or other sharp 
objects. Novice that I was when we 
bought our new borne, I did not begin 
to conceive of the multitude of pests 
thai would someday drive mc buggy 
(See? Would a perfectly sane person 
have made such an awful pun?). I did 
not know that soil composition was an 
important aspect of introducing new 
life lo a landscape, nor did realize how 
important fertilization, planting and 
watering practices would prove to be. 
Above all, t never considered that 
some of the advice I would receive 
would be balderdash — like my father- 
in-law's pyrotechnic pest control 
method. 

During the first spring season my 
then-new husband John and I spent in 
our tben-new bouse, wc noticed dense 
cobwebs suspended between several 
branches of a flowering tree on our 
property. 

"Ugh. what kind of spider spins 
those?" my husband asked me ner- 
vously. 

Visions of tyrannosaurus tarantulas 
danced through my head. "If a spider 
spun that, he con have the tree. Hell, 
be can have the bouse; we'll move," I 
replied. 

John's father lived close by. so wc 
decided to invite bint over to have a 
look. "Web worms," my father- in -low 
said knowingly when he saw the tree, 
'Tent calcrpi liars." 

"How do you get rid of them?" 
John and 1 asked in concert 

His answer was sure, confident. 
"There's only one way. You have to 
bum them out" 

Never mind that my falber-in-law 
lived clone in a trailer parked on a 
quarter-acre piece of dirt without a 
single stick, let alone a tree. Never 
mind that this Looncy-Tunc of a man 
made bis living combing railroad 
tracks for copper wire and spikes and 
broken bits of glass that he placed in 
shadowboxes made from wooden fruit 
crotcs, designs which he called "post- 
conslnictionalisl art," and sold to the 
kinds of fools who believe the original 
velvet Elvis is in the Louvre, No, my 
fother-in-law knew the bugs by more 



than one name, and in our eyes, that 
made the man a bug authority. 

I watched from a window as my 
father-in-law and my husband walked 

engaged in some weird ritual. The 
scents of lighter fluid and testosterone 
wafted my way. "Won't that kill the 
treeT' I called. 

Ignoring me, John touched the 
flame of a Zippo lighter to an over- 
head branch. Whoosh! Flames 
instantly engulfed my tree. 'Isn't this 
good for the Id?" my father-in-law 
laugbed. 

Two years passed before that crab- 
tree produced another leaf. That 
first spring was the worst, I recall 
investing a small fortune in summer 
flowers that I planted in various spots 
on my property— geraniums, aspara- 
gus fems, petunias, pansies, impatiens, 
begonias, marigolds, those odd little 
things that took like rainbow -colored 
brains — a wide array of annuals. My 
landscape bloomed in a beautiful 
(albeit costly) display that summer, 
but the following year, none of those 
expensive flowers grew back. 
Indignant, I phoned the greenhouse 
where I purchased them. "I spent 
about a zillion dollars on annuals at 
your place last year, and none of the 
damn things grew back . , . WHAT'S 
SO FUNNY?" The greenhouse 
employee was laughing and crying all 
at once when he told me that annuals 
die each year (because they're annu- 
als — get it, lady?). Next lime, he said 
between guffaws, plant perennials. 

I went back to the greenhouse to 
invest another small fortune — in 
perennials that time. A checkout clerk 
made small-talk as she rang me up. 
"Do you know some irate woman 
cussed us out the other day because 
her annuals didn't grow back?" she 
laughed, 

"Geez, what an idiot," I chuckled, 
turning red. "How do you tolerate the 
beat in here?" I asked sympathetically. 

I planted my perennials without 
incident, but that same season, I got 
slugged. My asters, you see, began to 
turn block. Later, my lilies-of- the- val- 
ley, my hosta, and my snow-on-the- 
mountain all turned black, as well. 
Dismayed. I called the Allen County 
Cooperative Extension Service and 
talked to our local professional horti- 
culturist. "My perennials have the 
Black Death," I wailed. 

"You probably have slugs. You 
need to put out slug-bait," be told me. 

The bait attracts the little slimers. 
then kills them much as dumping salt 
upon them would; that is. they turn to 
slug soup, and you can hear their lit- 
tle shrieks for miles — a gratifying 
experience. 

The horticulturist and I are on a 



; basis these days. I call him 

After my perennials survived the 
slug-fest I got cocky. I invested in 
seven Anabelle hydrangeas and plant- 
ed them the prescribed three-feet apart 
in holes several inches deeper than the 
pots they came in. I remembered lo 
ask the greenhouse personnel about 
soil composition — one part peal to two 
parts black soil was required, and I 
took care of that, too. 

That year and tbc following year, 
my hydrangeas turned black. Ah, I 
thought smugly, those little sluggers 
are stealing home again, eh? But I 
slug-baited my hydrangeas to no avail. 
I called Ibe horticulturist, and we 
brainstormed for half-an-bour. 
Wearily he said, "Okay. Let's go 
through this one more time. Where 
did you plant them?" 

"South side of the bouse." 

"Hmm," he mused. "Depth okay, 
distance okay, soil composition cor- 
rect, no slugs or other visible pests, no 
visible fungi. How often do you water 
them 7" 

Water? They need lo be watered? 
Then it occurred to me (I majored in 
English; after all): Hydra-angea = 
Water- sucker-upper. What a ninny I 
am, I thought. 

So you see, landscaping requires a 
very great deal of thought before you 
order a truckload of mulch or pick up 
a shovel. Assess your needs before 
you plant Then talk to the profession- 
als, the greenhouse personnel, land- 
scape architects, landscaping services, 
and horticulturists — not (hat idiot next 
door who can crush beer cons on his 
head and belches the alphabet (that is 
his talent, not landscaping). Compare 
results and be realistic. What plant 
life is particularly suited to your needs 
and desires? Do you want to invest a 
good deal of your leisure time into 
maintenance, or do you want a rela- 
tively worit-frec landscape? Roses arc 
very beautiful, for example, but they 
will suck the marrow from your 
bones — is that the kind of commitment 
you're willing to make? Choose 
plants that will thrive in your climate 
zone and planting exposure, and be 
careful to vary plant heights. (Don't 
forget: Plants grow). Learn from your 
mistakes: Heaven knows, you're 
bound to make many. Finally, always 
remember thai pyrotechnics, while 
effective, is not a suitable pest control 
method. 

This year, the web worms are back; 
they've pitched tents in my crab-tree 
again. As I write, I hear them out 
there singing little camp songs and 
playing caterpillar games. I won't 
have it. This time I swear to be rid of 
them, once and for all. 

Tomorrow, I'll buy a shotgun. ♦

New student body president expresses 
concerns about Communicator quality 



To the editor. 

I would like to express, first, my 
congratulations to the new Editor in 
Chief and I hope only the best for you 
and your staff in the upcoming issues. 
I know what it is to enter a new office 
and be criticized before you even have 
a chance to prove yourself. The pur- 
pose of this letter is not to criticize The 
Communicator but instead to find 
grounds of understanding and improvc- 

I have received many phone calls 
regarding last semester's issues. The 
phone calls taken by my staff and I all 
seemed lo focus around several issues 
that I will discuss in the remainder of 
this letter- I realize that I am by no 
means in a power position over The 
Communicator and that all I am trying 
to do is institute change. I am, howev- 
er, responsible to the students of IPFW 
and hope that by writing directly to you 
I can serve them better. 

Most of the callers were upset and 
simply wanted to vent their anger. I 
assume the majority of them thought 
(hat the Students' Government 
Association actually produced and 



funded the paper. After talking to the 
callers and explaining the government's 
position. I found a common ground to 
their complaints. 

First the students are upset with the 
lack of quality the paper has put out in 
the past. Students feel that the paper 
does not appear to have a professional 
appeal, such as objectivity and/or accu- 

Secondly, there ore several gram- 
matical problems with the paper and, 
since it is a college paper, this point is 
well token. 

Thirdly, there seems to be a bugc 
number of ads in each paper compared 
to the actual content 

Next, students arc complaining 
about the lock of university- or campus- 
related news, especially sports cover- 
age. Wc have several NCAA division 
teams who deserve coverage and adver- 



Finally, the students arc upset with 
the content of the paper itself. Of 
course, I have beard several times 
about freedom of tbc press. However, a 
paper must be responsible to its read- 
ers. Students feel thai they have not 



been given the full truth or say in the 
types of articles printed. 

I would like to say about the phone 
calls, as well as the visits to my office. 
that I *m not sure the majority of the 
students at IPFW do feel the same as 
those who have visited my office or 
called. I do. however, believe that they 
do represent a fair number of students. 

I have decided, after looking at 
these issues, to form a committee to 
effectively communicate between my 
office and The Communicator. This 
new committee which 1 hope lo be 
beaded by Chris Douse, a student sena- 
tor, will be responsible for all com- 
plaints and requests from my office to 

I wrote this letter because it was 
requested by your office but it is most 
likely the only letter I will be writing 
directly to you. 

Sincerely, 

Mark A. King 
Student Body President 



Those who sell-out must face the music 



To the editor. 

Dr. Chavis (Executive Director of 
NAACP), 

You gave us a sense of hope and wc 
felt at last there is a man who will lead 
the NAACP toward addressing Ibe 
needs of Africans in America. We tradi. 
tionally depend on those who assume 
leadership lo make a mark, a mark wc 
can identify as in the best interest of our 
people. The word is among our people, 
that Ibe Blacks in western suits have 
SOLD OUT THEIR RACE! 

Dr. Chavis, how is it that the 
NAACP, with its nationwide apparatus, 
has not created any jobs for Blacks? I 
mean, why is it the NAACP has never 
been involved in establishing business- 
es, black businesses?? How can the 
NAACP allow our people to pay bil- 



lions in taxes and wc ain't got shit? Our 
schools receive only a one-fourth of the 
money white schools receive; how do 
you guys go for that?? This country 
gives more aid to Russia (who wc all 
thought as the enemy) than they do to 
the African population in this country; 
bow is it you don't say anything about 
that?? 

The judicial system has replaced the 
auction blocks; it's true, slavery is alive 
and well in America. The slavers no 
longer have lo travel lo the coast of 
Africa for slaves, Ihcy can pick them up 
off the streets of America at 25 to 30 
thousand dollars a bead, business is bel- 
ter than ever. Prisons are plantations 
and huge industries. In tbc state of 
Indiana, prisoners and prisons are, by 
far, the largest industry in the state. 



We understand that the responsibili- 
ty of our liberation is equally shared 
among us all, bul when one sets them- 
selves out as leaders, then your respon- 
sibility covers those you say you repre- 
sent. You guys in the western suits 
have served to kill the efforts of all true 
liberators. You make sure that no 
efforts by real liberators (ibosc who 
oppose white supremacy) reach 

Dr. Chavis, the time will come when 
those who have worn the traitor's suit 
will reap their just rewards; even if wc 
must dig up your grave, wc will piss in 
your face. 

Victory is assured, 

Robert E, Kecbyu

Memorial Day Observances: An 

American veteran's reflections 



By Perry B. Monroe II 
Columnist 

Before you know it summer will be 
upon us and lo herald its arrival is 
Memorial Day. For many, cookouts and 
the Indy 500 will be the highlights of 
the three day weekend, but for others, 
Memorial Day is when we remember 
those who gave their lives in defense of 
this nation. 

Memorial Day dates back to the 
Civil War as a day to pay homage lo 
their friends. Sadly, however, it has lost 
its importance over the years. 

When I was in Beirut, Lebanon, 
serving with the 22nd Marine 
Amphibious Unit of the Multi-National 
Peacekeeping Force, our gunny was 
One of the "old corps" Marines to come 
out of Ka San during the Vict Nam 
War. He often told us, "For those who 
fought for it, freedom has flavor die 
protected will never know." 

I served as a radio /telephone opera- 
tor aod machine gunner for almost 
seven months until our command post 
'the Alamo,' came under enemy fire. 
The patrol suffered casualties and 
wounded during the ensuing fire fight 
but with supportive cover fire we were 
able to evacuate the wounded. My 
gunny ordered mc to go with the 
wounded, then I was seized by a severe 
burning pain in Ihe middle of my back. 
When wc got to the battalion aid sta- 
tion, the demists were preparing for 
surgery because all of our doctors had 
been killed in the bombing of the 
Marine Barracks. 

Well, I was told, by the dentists that 
I had to be one of the luckiest Marines 
in the world. A bullet had passed 
through my radio, which slowed the 
bullet down. What was so unbelievable 
was if Ihe bullet has passed two inches 
to the left it would have passed through 
my spine; two inches to the right, and 
the bullet would have passed through 
my lung; two inches higher, and the 
bullet would have passed through my 



I was given a second chance that 
day. Many of my friends were not so 
lucky. For my actions I was awarded 
the Purple Heart and Navy 
Commendation Medal for Valor. It is 
our responsibility to sec that such sacri- 
fices are remembered; Americans who 
work in factories, universities, and gro- 
cery stores. Americans who have given 
their loyal service and even their lives 
deserve to be remembered 

Because others have fought for our 
rights to do so, it is important that we 
exercise our right to vote, our right to 
free speech, and our right to petition the 
government. America is not only a 
political stale, it is a society that was 
shaped by many people, in many ways. 

America is based on tbe principles 
of freedom of expression, toleration of 
differences and belief in peaceful com- 
promise. We take our freedom for 
granted as we come and go on our 
merry ways, but remember: it came 
with a price thai many paid with their 
life, Even now we are grappling with a 
price that many paid with their lives 

Many veterans return home lake off 
their uniforms and become on ordinary 
citizen, just like old Francis. In the 
small town of Waterloo, Indiana, he is 
tbc town's crosswalk-guard for the 
school. He gets around well for a man 
in his mid 70's. Every day, he escorts 
the kids across U S 427, giving each a 
piece of candy at the end of their trek. 
What you don't see is tbe tattoo on his 
leg-his name in Japanese. He received 
that tattoo on the island of Batlon. He is 
also one of the few Americans to sur- 
vive tbe 'death march.' If you ask old 

straight forwardly. "It's for tbe kids." 

We have an obligation to our chil- 
dren, families and friends to tell Ibe sto- 
ries of our veterans. Each has paid for 
this country with their blood, sweat and 
tears, and each gave no hope of a better

Scene: 

As I walk out of my apartment 
toward my car. I can hear a loud 
thumping bass sound coming from a 
car parked beside mine. As I open my 
door. I glance over to see whose car 
was literally jumping off the ground. 
Because of the engraved stereotypes in 



rind I

Americans in the vehicle. 

Instead. I found some while folks 
dressed in Ihe regular drag with the bat 
turned backwards. Raiders sweatshirt 
baggy black jeans, and, of course, they 
were speaking the the so-called "Black" 
dialect : "Whassup. man? Me? Nolhin'. 
Me and my homey are jusl chillin' out 
and alt Ya krjow what I'm savin'." 



A nurse I met who served in Viet 
Nam told mc of a dead solidcr, who bad 
lain on their coffee-room floor. Coldly 
analysing his fatal wounds and his pro- 
truding internal organs, she causally 
sipped her coffee. It was as if she was 
as dead as that solidcr on the coffee- 
room floor. It was Robert E. Lee who 
said of war, "It is a good thing war is so 
terrible, or we would become fond of it. 

Velerans know what "Been there" 
or "Done that" really means. 
As American college students, we need 
to actively labor for the establishment 
of a memorial on campus to all tbe vet- 
erans of Indiana and Purdue universi- 
ties. Specific names are not necessary- 
only a place where their conflict can be 
remembered. Tbey shall not grow old, 
as wc who are left will. Age shall not 
weary them, and as we become weary 
with the passage of lime, we will 
remember them. 

Our ability to assemble in a realm of 
higher learning, to consecrate tbe ideals 
of our fathers, our hope of peace, was 
granted to us by our nation's veterans. 
As veterans we come together to 
remember tbe words of Sgt Berry 
Benson of S.C. 

"Who knows? He asked as his nar- 
rative drew to a close, thai ii may be 
given to us to meet again in tbe old 
quarters, to play chess, and dress to get 
up soon to answer the morning toll call. 
To fall in at the tap of the drum for drill 
and dress parade and hastily don our 
war gear, while the power of the long 
roll summons us to battle Who knows? 
But again the old flags raged and torn 
snapping in tbe wind to face each other, 
pursuing and being persued. While the 
cries of victory fill a summers day and 
after the battle, tbe slam and wounded 
will arise and all will meet together 
under tbe two flags, all sound and well. 
There will be talking and laugher and 
cheers and all will say. did it not seem 
real. Was it as not in the old days?" 



I bad to stop and think to myself, 
"what the bell is going on here?" 

Why are a portion of white folk in 
this country trying to be black? And 
what are they trying to prove? 

Andrew Hacker, author of "Two 
Nations: Black and White. Separate, 
Hostile. Unequal" suggests,

IPFW: 

Coming out of 
the Dark Ages 



Whether you Agree or disagree with 
what the Communicator has said in the 
past, we all can appreciate the dedica- 
tion this paper has in covering racial 
diversity. It is much belter to openly 
discuss our tensions with other groups 
in society, rather than let the frustration 
hmld. Education is the only way for 
further progress. With all oT this in 
mind, I am proud lo have been asked to 
join the forces of the Communicator in 
covering homosexual issues. 1 have 
always been vocal when the subject of 
gay rights has been discussed. I wish to 
thank the Communicator for giving me 
the opportunity to help the gay com- 
munity's progress, 

I am pleased to announce that this 
summer, IPFW will have a gay rights 
organization for social, educational, 
and political purposes. This will give 
those students who arc interested in 
gay culture a chance to learn more 
about our community and why we are 
increasingly becoming a stronger 
force. But why is such on organization 
needed here 7 

Not only do both Indiana and 
Purdue Universities have gay organiza- 
tions, but so do most other schools 
across the notion. Not having o club of 
this nature is keeping IPFW back in the 
Dark Ages. I was completely knocked 
over when I was informed that 
Manchester College, a private little 
school about an hour from here, has a 
gay organization. This is a deeply reli- 
gious school 1 am speaking of, and 
they have a gay organization. Yet. we 
do not. Wc have many other civil 
rights organizations-, it is time for o gay 
rights organization. 

It's not just about having an organi- 
zation that is important. There are 
many things thai wc, as a group, can 
do together. One is to offer a social 
environment to those gays who feel 
they are tbc only homosexuals at 
school. Straights can also show their 
support for their gay friends by joining 
this club.-*

'To be black in America means rein- 
ing in your opinions and emotions u 
no whites ever have to do Not to 
mention the forced and false smiles 
you ue espected lo contrive, to assure 
while Americans that you harbor no 
grievances against them At times, 

the conclusion teems all hut self-evi- 
dent that while America has no desire 
for your presence or any need for your 
people- 
Now, if that's true, why would 
someone want lo try and imitate 
another ethnic group, let alone one 
that is always under constant discrimi- 
nation? 

As an African- American. 1 must 
speak out lo the fact thai being black 
is not about wearing clothes ihal don't 
fit or using the "be" verbs incorrectly. 
That's not being black That's being 
ignorant, and it's an insult to African- 
Americans. 

Being African- American is a state 
of being. It is tbc ability to continue to 
survive in a world where all the strikes 
are against you. It is Ihe constant quest 
lo discover your culture. It's the slate 
of being in which an individual has 
not only achieved self-actualization 
but a oneness with their creator. 

It is unrealistic for white people to 
imitate 'gansla' rappers and tell 
African- Americans they understand 
what they ore going through because 
they listen to rap music, have many 
'Black' friends and dale African- 
Americans, and of course, live in 'that 
area' (the inner cily). My answer to 
them is-I don't think so. But I think 
wc need lo look inio the reasons why 
people try to integrate into another 
ethnic group. 

One hypothesis concerns defining 



one's own t-emj Bctauic ol coming 
from dsy functional home* twhere u 
one u sexually molested, or menully 
or physically abused), some white 
people incorrectly identify ihe "Black 
strength" of rough garula t&gt;i&gt;e men or 
the African -American women who 
don't take any type of disrctpevi from 
anyone The individuals then absorb 
these characteristics in an attempt to 
appear "strong" which creates the 
false black image Vet theie people 
fail lo realue tji.il MOM of Ihe reasons 
why those men and women are 10 
rough and hard is because of the 
adverse conditions and poor environ- 
ment they inhahit This ii not excuse 
the fact thai people have Lbc ibUlty to 
choose the direction they want to take 
in life later own It's just lo explain 
why Blacks are in a certain condition. 
There are icveral while people. 
however who suffer from white guilt. 
These individuals arc ashamed of their 
ancestors' human rights violations 
agoinst people of color and are trying 
to make amends for their sins by 
learning more about African- 
American culture; until Ihcy reach tbc 
point that they are trying to integrate 
into Ihc African-American ethnic 
group These people foil lo realize lhat 
because of the unjust treatment of 
Black folk by racist while folk Ihcy 
will never be able lo assimilate into 
the African -American culture because 
of a mechanism designed hy while 
folks colled race. It is because of 
this mechanism that Black people who 
hove no sense of their own self or cul- 
ture can not integrate into society. 
Therefore, they must also strive like 
while folk to find self. *

Recognition 

IPFW administrators recognized 
for their investment in youth 



Taking time out to work with 
youth requires people who arc com- 
mitted to 'going the extra mile' Such 
people don't receive the special 'thank 
you' that many people need, and they 
have to deal with youth who experi- 
ence tumultuous emotions toward 
homelifc or interpersonal relation- 
ships. Such a job doesn't always pay 
well, considering the time and effort 
required to deal with youth. 

For Charles Washington, associate 
director of Career Services, and 
Marcia Y. Tapp-Sanders, director of 
Future Academic Scholars' Track 
(FAST) . however, payday has 

These two IPFW administrators 
recently received the Indiana Youth 
Investment Award for their continual 
efforts in working with Indiana youth 
from the Indiana Youth Institute, 

Beitye J. Poignard, director of 
Multicultural Services and one of the 
first recipients of this award, nominat- 
ed Washington and Topp-Sanders ear- 
lier this year, 

"I think I've been in a strategic 
position to see them in action with 
students and the difference they made 
in both the FAST and Mastering the 
Possibilities programs," Poignard 
explained. 

The criteria for the award requires 
the nominees to spend at least 20 
hours per week with young people. 
Judgement is also based, in port, on 
the nominees' written responses lo 15 
essay questions. 

"The primary function of the 
Indiana Youth Institute is to help 
young people grow up healthy in 
Indiona," Poignard commented, 
"Those of us that are a part of the 
'army' arc fortunate to have (hem 

Tapp-Snnders becomes first FAST 
director 

Every year Marcia Y. Tapp- 
Sonders prepares for the incoming 
middle school and high school stu- 
dents who will meet every other 
Saturday in October to participate in 
the FAST program. 

Established in 1987 through fund- 
ing from the Eli Lilly Foundation, 
Indianapolis, and the Foellingcr 
Foundation, Fort Wayne, the FAST 
program was developed by Director of 
Multicultural Services Bctlyc J. 
Poignard. 

Al Poignard's request, Tapp- 
Sandcrs left her job as manager of 
Vocational Studies and Education at 
Anthony Wayne Services to become 
the first director of Ihe FAST pro- 

"I like the FAST program because 
we have them [the students) for sin 
years and belp them consider college 
as a choice," Tapp-Sanders said. 

A graduate from Indiana State with 
a B.S. in speech and hearing and a 
M.S. in education from Indiana 
University at Fort Wayne, Tapp- 
Sanders is in charge of planning the 
summer and fall sessions for the stu-

Tapp-Sanders feels it is important 
for students to see college as a viable 
option even if they are not in the lop 
half of their class, 

"Students who are average — with o 
support group-can do well," Tapp- 
Sanders commented. "That's what I 
like — helping them reach their direc- 
tor of the FAST program."

"I was blessed lo have very caring 
and committed parents, and I feel 
committed to give that back lo these 
youth who don't have the same." 
Washington explained. 

Besides, coach Washington also 
serves as a Big Brother and a Project 
2000 menior. 

Tbe Project 2000 program was ini- 
tiated to combat Dr Spencer 
Holland's observation of this phenom- 
enon: African -American males' suc- 
cess in academics begins to decline 
after tbe third grade. 

"You never know what kind of 
affect you have on someone." 
Washington commented, "but you 
have (o be Ibere to have any effect. 
It's very important for young African- 
American males to see positive role 
models," 

When be isn't working. 
Washington enjoys taking bis young 
prodigies on camping trips or excur- 
sions to see Ihe Indiana Pacers, foot- 
ball gomes, or visit historical Black 
colleges such as Fisk, Tennessee Stale 
and Mebarry Medical School.

Washington realizes that single moth- 
ers can only do so much with their 
young male children. He feels that 
men can help out single mothers on 
certain issues of support by simply 
being around. 

"Only men can make boys into 
men." Washington added. 

Washington graduated from IPFW 
with a B.S. in supervision and later 
received an M.S. in education.

American students. Washington was

Tapp-Sanders feels it is important 
for students to see college as a viable

"Students who are average — with a

Virginia Richardson, a 1994 soon- 
to-be graduate of Snider High School 
and FAST ambassador, admires Tapp- 
Sanders for her "motherly" image. 

"Mrs. Tapp-Sanders is a very 
patient person, which is good," said

As associate director, Washington 
coordinates and teacbes "Freshman 
Success" and "Career Beginnings," 
two courses which emphasize interac- 
tion between the college student and 
professor. He also interprets testing 

ing students. 

Washington feels it is important 
that, as an administrator, he keeps 
close contact with the students on 
campus. 

"It's kind of personal," 
Washington stated. "My impression 
is, the higher up one becomes in the 
administration, tbe less contact one 
has with students and people. In my 
case, I would like to break that stereo- 
type."

A fairly common misconception 
jKiut tenure is that it guarantees that a 
professor cannot lose his or her faculty 
membership, laid Vice Chancellor 
Michael A Worrell and Associate Vice 
Chancellor David McCanti. 

Wartell asserted, however, that 
tenure "is not a right to work. Tenure 
does not protect a faculty member from 
removal with cause." 

Tenure may be awarded to a faculty 
member "after having served a proba- 
tionary period," McCanls explained. 

The probationary period is a process 
of annual renewal until Ihe employee on 
probation is deemed sufficiently quali- 
fied to be offered a continuous renew- 
al-tenure, that is. 

McCanls stated. "The American 
Association of University Professors 
recommends a tenure decision be made 
within six years of hire. If tenure is 
granted, it becomes effective at the end 
of ihe seventh year," 

To enter into the probationary period 

McCanls said, "The purpose of 
tenure is to ensure academic 
freedom-to protect the discovery and 
profession of knowledge. Sometimes 
professing- teaching-is contro venial." 

When faculty feel that their tenure 
rights bavc been infringed upon, tbey 
may file a formal grievance with the 
Faculty Board of Review. 



Wanell noted that "Greivince hear- 
ings are generally public. I bcliesc. u 
ire Ihe findings of the Board of Review 
Hearings, however, before the Board 
are not obligatory: the Board bases the 
decision to bear or not to hear a case 
based on iheir estimation of the merit of 
the case.'* 

Wartell explained that tenure Dal) 
"protects the rights of a Faculty member 
lo be immune from academic discrimi- 
nation " ll Joes not protect (acuity Irvm. 
among other misdeeds, sexual h arris t- 
ment charges or incompetence in leach- 
ing. Wartell said. 

The tenure process allows the insti- 
tution lo employ individuals with edu- 
cational goals which arc commesurate 
with the mission of the university Su*.h 
a relationship best serves the public. 
McCanls added. 

The tenure process is governed by 
the academic policies as set forth in the 
academic handbook, which slate): In 
order to meet its responsibilities to its 
students and to society, the University 
must attract and retain faculty and 
librarians of outstanding quality. To 
that end, the University provides acade- 
mic freedom and economic security, 
which ore implicit in the principle of 
faculty and library tenure. The faculty 
members, on their port, arc obligated to 
maintain high standards of leaching, 
research, service, and professional con- 
duct. 

The Board of Review operates 
according lo the Bylaws of Ihe Faculty
