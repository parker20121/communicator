Scuba diving course to 
be offered in January 



by Deb Foster 



Life is short but some 
people seem to fill ii with 
the experiences other peo- 
ple say they'll do one day, 
Michael Gaff Is one of the 
doers. Mike has been scuba 
diving since he was sixteen 
and flying since he was se- 
venteen. After graduating 
from Snider High School in 
1968 he attended I-PU part- 
time for four semesters. 

In February of 1970 while 
attending a sporting goods 
convention, Mikemetaman 
who was running a diving 
expedition in Honduras. 
The expedition was center- 
ed around a wreck called 
The Santiago, a Spanish 
galleon that went down in 
1660 with a $300,000 cargo 
of silver and gold. 

By the fall of 1970 he had 
sold everything he owned 
and purchased five percent 
of the expedition. Besides 
the main wreck seventeen 
other wreck sites were lo- 
cated and the expedition 
was also involved in buil- 
ding an underwater park. 

Touchy domestic prob- 
lems in the Honduran gov- 
ernment caused many 
problems for the expedi- 
tion. Periodic seizures 
wore inadL' of the diver's 
aquircd artifacr-s, and the 
divers were cuntinu.illy 
harra.sscd. One .spcciric in- 
stance of this WiiK a Liw per- 



taining only to Americans 
which prohibited them from 
going shirtless. Mike and 
three others were arrest- 
ed on thischarge. His com- 
ments to the woman police 
chief resulted In a one day 
imprisonment and a $1.50 
fine for him. 

He was then sent home by 
the ambassador for a one 
month cooling off period 
and he returned to Los An- 
geles. 

The expedition is still 
continuing and the Honduran 
government was recently 
overthrown in a coup. 

Mike Is now a freshman 
marketing student carrying 
fifteen hours and teaching 
a scuba diving class at the 
YWCA 

On January 10th he will 
instruct a thirty hour 
course in scuba diving 
there. The class will start 
at 7:00 p.m. with halfofthe 
time devoted to lecture and 
the otherhalf to water 
work. Seven of the eight 
weekly classes will be 
in the pool with the last 
class taking place in open 
water. 



All equipment except for 
mask , fins, and snorkel 
;wlll be provided for the 

first class. Duringthe first 
session some water work 
will be done with an orien- 
tation to skin diving. Dur- 
ing orientation instruction 
on the purchase of equip- 
ment will be given. Pass- 
ing students will be cert- 
ified divers with all skills 
necessary for safe fresh- 
water diving, and will re- 
ceive a membership card 
from the Professional 
Association of Diving In- 
structors, This will enable 
students to rent equipment 
and to purchase air. 

Those wishing to enroll In 
the class must be at least 
fifteen years old and able 
to adapt to water. 

To enroll in the course

He isalso teaching the same 
course at Auburn starting 
January 8th at 7:U0p.m. To

YMCA; the fee is $50. 



Debaters 
win again 

The Mastodon Debate 
Club participated In an un- 
ique tournament on Decem- 
ber 9 at Hanover College, 
The tournament, called 
"A Day of Commun- 
ication," featured discus- 
sion, extemporaneous 
speaking, and persuasive 
speaking. Each participant 
competed in every event. 
The theme of the day was 
a broadly worded question 
on the subject of ecology. 
The Debate Club was well 
represented by Sharon Alt, 
who was judged the out- 
standing contestant when 
she received first place 
In each of the three speak- 
Ing events, and by Mike 
Schlatter and Lief Sodder- 
ling, who received two se- 
cond place and two third 
place rankings, respec- 
tively.

gions as many as three or 
as few as none may be

create and maintain ever 
Increasing sources of 
audience for the per-

Real development foe 
is budget agency 

While everyone here was crying wolf over the Master 
Plan ofthe Indiana Commission for Higher Education (HEC), 
a very real threat to the Fort Wayne Campus was develop- 
ing. The State Budget Agency wascuttingthe budgets of the 
regional campus systems of both Indiana and Purdue uni- 
versities to the tune of 17 million dollars from the HEC 
recommendations. 

While regional campuses are being told they would have 
less money in 1973-75 biennlum than In 1971-73, the main 
campuses at Bloomington and West Lafayette will exper- 
ience an increase of nearly four million dollars each. 

These budget proposals directly contravenes the 1969 
General Assembly's policy of expanding and improvingthe 
regional and smaller campuses and limiting the large re- 
sidential campuses. The budget also dismisses as out of 
hand the recommendations of the HEC. 

In spite of all previous policy directives given It, the Stale 
Budget Agency has decided co halt and turnback growth on 
the regional campuses and to Increase the excetlenceof the 
Bloomington and West Lafayette campuses. 

The message given to Hoosiers by the Budget Agency Is 
that only at the large campuses will there be academic ex- 
cellency. Regional campuses should serve as a minor lea- 
gue to the main campuses. 

The budget laughs in the face of the principle of equal 
educational opportunity for all. Our only hope Is that the 
General Assembly laughs In the face of the State Budget 
Agency.

Invaluable papers 

Last Thursday night Iwas 
marooned on the Ice flats 
of the east B lot. Safety 
and Security could do no- 
thing to rescue me. In 
my despair I remembered 
the Communicator, got a 
bundle of papers from the 
lobby, stuffed them baieath 
the car wheels, and made 
it home without further ado. 
Many thanks.

Jonaa biased? 



In a recent article in the 
Communicator, Stan Jones 
accuses a presentation gi- 
ven by a member of the 
Committee of Concerned 
Asian Scholars asbeing bi- 
ased. Jones states that 
since the CCAS Is an anti- 
war group they "quite nat- 
urally" have "pre - con- 
c elved notions about the 
roles of China, the United 
States and other Asian 
countries in Asian af- 
fairs," This may be true, 
but Mr. Jones goes on to 
imply that because of these 
pre-conceptlons an honest 
picture of world affairs 
cannot come out of this 
group. The burden of proof 
seems to fall on Mr. Jones. 
If there are pre-con- 
ceptlons Mr. Jones should 
make them clear to us, 
and further, he should show 
us that these pre-concep- 
tions actually do distort 
the truth of the matter at 
hand. 

But beyond all this I find 
a serious difficulty In Mr. 
Jones' ad homlnem argu- 
ment. Although It may have 
been unintentional Mr. 
Jones, in stating ob- 
jections to what he con- 
siders to be a presenta- 
tion molded by preconcep- 
tions. Implicitly asserts 
that what he has to say 
is free of pre-conceptlons. 
There seems to be Im- 
plicit In Mr. Jones' argu- 
ment the notion that be- 
cause the Chinese are "be- 
ing driven by as ruthless 
a dictatorship as the world 
has known" they must 
therefore be unhappy, and 
any photograph or slide 
presentation which does not 
show an unhappy face is a 
distortion of what actually 
is the case. Just because 
Mr, Jones has never seen 
"pictures , or live situa- 
tions, of more than a doz- 
en people at one time where 
at least one person was dis- 
playing a non - smiling 
facial expression" does 
not mean that such situa- 
tions cannot occur, what- 
ever the situation may be 
In China It Is certainly a 
pre-conceptlon to say that 
the people there should be 
showing some kind of facial 
expressions compatible 
with what we think they 
should be feeling. 

I am not clainjlng that I 
am free of pre-conceptlons 
but there seems to me to 



be a difference between 
stating one's preconcep- 
tions outright and imposing 
them upon others while im- 
plicitly (either Intention- 
ally or unintentionally) not 
claiming to have any. After 
all the use of the term "pre 
conceived notions" seems 
to me to have been used by 
Mr. Jones to prejudice our 
opinions against CCAS. The 
argument that seems to run 
"of course you know what 
kind of a group they are - 
so why listen to them?" 
Such an argument, no mat- 
ter by whom it is used. Is 
not sound either logically 
or ethically.

Gottlieb vs, l&amp;M: 
round three 

The full-page advertise- 
ments of the Indiana and 
Michigan Electric Compa- 
ny appearing recently 
(Tuesday November 21 and 
28, 1972, pages 12 A and 7A, 
respectively) in the Fort 
Wayne newspapers entitled 
"ElectricycUng A Smash- 
ing Success" and "We've 
been Environmentalists 
more than 30 years" re- 
quire a reply. This reply 
Is necessitated by the ex- 
tremely misleading claims 
made by I &amp; M in theseads 
with the knowledge and con- 
sent of Its parent company, 
American Electric Power 
Service Corporation. 

I &amp; M claims that "some 
special Interest groups see 
only the polutlon caused by 
electricity production." I 
wrote to I &amp; M requesting 
the names and addresses of 
these "special Interest 
groups," The following Is 
the reply sent by their Pub- 
lic Affairs Director, "I'm 
sure you know well who they 
are sine eyoua liege dly 
speak for several," In view 
of the fact that on the Issue 
of the energy crisis and the 
I &amp; M/ AEP advertising 
campaign I speak for my- 
self, as a concerned citi- 
zen, as well as for The 
Coalition For The Environ- 
ment, I can categorically 
state that we see far more 
than "only the pollution 
caused by electricity pro- 
duction," This blatant pre- 
varication (I am tempted 
to call It a prefabrication) 
by I &amp; M/AEP lends con- 
crete support for question- 
ing the veracity of their 
other claims (not that their 
claims cannot be contested 
In their own right). 

I Si M claims to have been 
"Environmentalists more 
than 30 years". They then 
proceed to define environ- 
mentalist as "one concern- 
ed with the total ecological, 
social and cultural condi- 
tions that Influence the life 
of a community. "This is an 
Inadequate definition. It Is 
Insufficient to be "concern- 
ed" about the environment. 
More Importantly one 
should be actively engaged 
in correcting environment- 



al deficiencies, Handwrlng- 
ing, concerned individuals 
rarely, if ever, get any- 
thing positive accom- 
plished. 

Since I &amp; M/AEP claims 
to be "environmentalists 
more than 30 years" It 
would be In order to ex- 
amine their performance 
record. In examining this 
record we should be look- 
ing for evidence that the 
company, on their own, du- 
ring this 30 year period 
has undertaken to avoid 
degrading the environment 
as they built new plants as 
well as looking for evidence 
of enlightened views on en- 
vironmental problems by 
higher management. 

AEP hasapproximately 17 
coal-fired plants which 
consume between 25-30 
million tons of coal per 
year. Approximately 16,6 
of this coal is derived from 
AEP's coal companies' 
strip-mining operations. I 
assume the public Is al- 
ready Informed a bout the 
marked ecological des- 
truction resulting from 
strip-mining. In a previous 
letter, Tom Dustin pointed 
out the gross inadequacies 
of I &amp; M/AEP's ecological 
approach in constructing 
their nuclear plant on Lake 
Michigan. 

According to the Council 
on Economic , p.^ripsUi^s^ 
which completed" art Fnfen- 
sive study of the electric 
power Industry In the early 
part of 1972, AEP's emis- 
sion of particulate material 
from their power stacks, 
before 1971. was approxi- 
mately 196,000 pounds per 
hour (one billion seven hun- 
dred andthinyslxthousand 
pounds per year). The CEP 
claims that "AEP operates 
obsolete mechanical dust 
collectors at 11 out of 17 
plants, and is the only com- 
pany that has failed to ac- 
hieve adequate particulate 
control at even one of its 
-sites." Fifteen out of 17 ■ 
AEP plants "have hourly 
soot emissions In either 
four or five figures," The 
Twin Branch Plant In MIs- 
hawaka, Ind., built In 1925, 
emits 15,321 pounds of soot 
per hour. This plant Is re- 
ported to have the lowest 
quality emission control- 
equipment In the study. The 
Clinch River plant In Carbo, 
va., built in 1958 has, since 
1964, emitted 11,400 lbs. 
of particulates per hour 
(99,864,000 lbs, annually). 
This plant is reported to 
have the third highest 
emission rate In the AEP 
system. The Tanners Creek 
plant, Laurenceburg, Ind,, 
bulk in 1951, emits 11,735 
lbs. of particulates per 
hour. This plant, according 
to the CEP study, "has out- 
dated mechanical col- 
lectors at three out of four 
boilers; the precipitator 
on the fourth, designed for 
an already substandard 90%

Section of academic deveiopment 
and counseiing division 
designated for non-degree students 



By Anita Lamos 



The Academic Devel- 
opment and Counseling Di- 
vision was created to work 
with students from I-PU 
who enter on an explora- 
tory basis. Also in this di- 
vision are students In the 
Allied Health areas of stu- 
dy and those who will tran- 
sfer to Bloomington to 
complete their studies; 
those in HPER and Library 
Science. These students 
have declared rhelr con- 
centration of study but have 
no academic home on this 
campus. It Is the purpose 
of this division to provide 
academic counseling to 
these students. In addition 
to this, however, counsel- 
ing services of an educa- 
tional, personal, social, 
and/or occupational nature 
are also available. As men- 
tioned In connection with 
the story on the Counseling 
and Testing Division In the 
December 1 issue, various 
tests and inventories are 
available and may be used 
as a basis for counseling. 

At present the twelve hun- 
dred students served by 
this division are about 
evenly divided between the 
two parent universities. 
Those who are registered 
In Purdue are non-degree 
students. These will eicher 
have to transfer Into anot- 
her division (school) or 
transfer to another campus 
in order to complete their 
college work. The majority 
of the work done recently 
in this office has been the 
pre-registration of these 
students. 

The Indiana students who 
are In this division are 
those students who have 
been regularly admitted, 
but have not decided on 
their area of study. Pre- 
viously they were classi- 
fied as "undecided", but 
are now known also as 
"non-degree" students. 
In this area of non-degree 
students are the following: 
Transfer students- those 
who have come from an- 
other school and Intend to 
stay on this campus. 

Transient students~s t u - 
dents enrolled at another 
college who are taking one 
or two courses not avail- 
able on their home cam- 
pus. 

Adults-people from the 
community taking a course 
simply forsetf-enrlchment 
simply for self-enrich- 
ment. These people need 
not file all of the regular 
admission forms In order 
to take classes In this man- 
ner. 




Dr. Bob Craig, Associate Director of the Academic Coun- , 
seling and Development holds degrees from Bethel College, 
Tennessee; Middle Tennessee State; and the University of 
Missouri at Columbia. Dr. Craig Is also an Assistant Pro- 
fessor in Education for Purdue and Acting Registrar, 



High School Students- stu- 
dents given permission by 
their high school to take 
college-level courses in 
addition to their regular 
study load. 

Temporary students- 
these are students who are 
qualified to enter as regu- 
1 a r d e g r e e-seeking stu- 
dents, but are not able to 
get all the necessary forme 
In before the deadline for 
one reason or another. So 
for one semester they are 
classified a s non-degree 
until all forms (transcript, 
etc.) are on file. 

Delayed admission or 
those denied regular ad- 
nilssion-ihls includes stu- 
dents who may be lacking 
courses necessary for re- 
gular admission and those 
who are weak In certain 
study areas and need a llt- 
tle extra help and time be- 



fore tackling a full college 
load. For these who need 
extra help a special class 
has been designed to pro- 
vide that additional bit of 
knowledge to put them over 
the hump. 

Information for incoming 
students as to areas of 
study and assigned mis- 
sions of the parent univer- 
sities Is available from this 
office. Recently two 
Informative seminars for 
students of the respective 
universities p r o v I d ed In- 
formation on the degree 
programs offered by each 
school. 

Students should be aware 
that services of this office 
also Include counseling for 
problems other than aca- 
demic. This includes all 
students, not just those In 
this division.

B-ballers win 
one of two 

The I.P. Mastodons played 
cwo gamesthlspasiweek 
and won just one of them. 
The loss to St. Francis 
Tuesday night broke a three 
game winning streak and 
was their first loss of the 
home schedule. Thus far 
the Mastodons have played 
eight away games and won 
two, while notching up 2 of 
3 home victories, 

Saturday afternoon the 
Tuskers put together their 
best game of the season 
against Indiana-Purdue 
Indianapolis. Tom Bernlng 
was 60 hot that he could 
have shot with his left foot 
and still have made It. Don 
Chaney seta new school re- 
cord with 13 converted free 
throws, but he could only 
flnsih second best toBern- 
Ing's 33 points with 29. 
Gary Trump showed us that 
he can hit from outside by 
pumping in 9 field goals. 
Gary ended up with 22 
points. These three men 
combined to score 84 
points. Indianapolis fin- 
ished with 81. 

Our men not only scored 
well, but as a team they 
played superbll. Indiana- 
polls has put together a fine 
team, but they were throt- 
tled by the Mastodons de- 
fense. 

Tuesday night the Tuskers 
threw apart everything that 
they had previously put to- 
gether. St. Francis has a 
fine veteran team, but 
there's no doubt In this 
writer's mind that ourteam 
Is better. But our team 
wasn't better that night a- 
galnst St. Francis. They 
started out well, hitting at 
a a high percentage from 
everywhere on the court. 
But with about twelve min- 
utes to go In the first half, 
our men hit a cold streak 
and allowed the Trou- 
badores to build up a nine- 
teen point lead. The Tusk- 
ers fought back and cut 
the deficit to only four 
points early In the second 
half, but our turnovers re- 
sulted In six straight points 
for St. Francis, and we ne- 
ver came close again. 

The men who represent 
Indiana-Purdue didn't hus- 
tle well and displayed a 
general lack of spirit. 
There were more fans for 
the visitors at our home 
game than Mastodon sup- 
porters.

soot removal, is functiun- 
Ing at an estimated 16% 
belov/ thi« efficient level." 
At least yy,3^ remuvdl Is 
possible by presently avai- 
lable equipment. 

Big Sandy, Louisa, Ky. 
(1963) accordingtotheCEP 
was "cited by a company 
engineer in congressional 
hearings in 1970 as an ex- 
ample of state-of-the-art 
emission controI(wlth pre- 
cipitator s designed for 
98.5% efflciencyactual- 
ly achieves only 90% soot 
and ash removal on one of 
Its two boilers, a level ob- 
tainable before 1940 ac- 
cording to the engineer's 
display chart." 

Even AEP's newest 
Mitchell and Amos plants, 
(b 1970, 1971) located in 
Captlna and St. Albans, W. 
Va., respectively, are e- 
qulpped with "under- - 
performing precipitators 
which emit 4,500-5,200 lbs. 
particulates per hour." 

As concerns sulfur oxide 
production, Che CEP report 
states, "AEP also faces by 
far the most serious sulfur 
dioxide problemof any util- 
ity In the study." TheU.S, 
Department of Health, Ed- 
ucation and Welfare re- 
ported In 1970 that AEP 
emits approximately 4% of 
all the sulfur dioxide In the 
U.S., 1.28 million tons. AEP 
has committed itself to 
burning high sulfur con- 
taining coal because of Its 
failure to spend money nec- 
essary research. Very lit- 
tle has been done by AEP 
to control nitrogen oxide 
emission. 

I believe the above data 
are sufficiently represen- 
tative to prove my point 
as concerns AEP's lack of 
concern for the environ- 
ment without having to cite 
specific particulate emis- 
sion data in all the other 
AEP plants or all the speci- 
fic sulfur oxide and nitro- 
gen oxide data. 

Let us look at the alti- 
tude of their enlightened 
management (as it pertains 
to the particulate problem). 
An AEP Vice - President 
was reported (by the CEP) 
to have said, "A lot of the 
plants are way out In the 
country.. .In the Kentucky 
hills, for Instance. No one 
even lives out there. Some 
of those plants don't have 
the best precipitators, and

One of the Students' Gov-

this year, the movie 
sketches a world of half 
empty churches but not en- 
tirely without a hope in 



God's universe. It tells the 
story of a village pastor, 
who, empty of faith and 
desperately unloved, re- 
veals his bitter failure to 
offer spiritual consolation 
to his flock.

they may never, because 
it's not needed." More 
need not be said about the 
enlightened environmental 
attitude of a company that 
has been environmentalists 
for 30 years. 

I&amp;M brags about their re- 
search expenditures. It 
should be brought to the 
public's attention that In 
1970 AEP spent approxi- 
mately $2.8 million on re- 
search and development 
and $19.6 million dollars 
(seven times as much as 
it spent on R&amp;D) on ad- 
vertising and sales. Most 
of this R&amp;D inoney was. 
spent on a high-voltage 
transmission program and 
not pollution abaiemSHT 
programs. Thesehlgh-vol- 
tage systems were built 
for economic rather than 
environmental reasons. 
Although AEP dropped con- 
sumer advertising In 1970, 
they began a massive ad- 
vertising program this 
year which will end on or 
about Dec. 10, 1972. I re- 
cently learned that I&amp;M/ 
AEP is planning another 
massive advertising pro- 
gram early in 1973. 

According to the CEP, 
"Instead of lending the in- 
dustry in sulfur dioxide re- 
moval research, as might 
bechoose a utiUty of this 
size and financial heft 
whose mines produce high 
sulfur coal, AEP chose to 
build tall stacks.. ..AEP 
now concedes that the 
stacks may only be an 'in- 
terim solution.' Only 
$289,000 was spent on sul- 
fur removal techniques 
between 1969 and 1971 — 
a fraction of the amount 
needed If laws restricting 
sulfur dioxide emissions 
from existing sources are 
passed." 

CEP al so report s that 
AEP stated In June, 1971 
in a response to a CEP 
questionnaire, "We would 
most likely have to shut 
down a number of our ma- 
jor plants if some agency 
were to promulgate a law 
requiring us to burn low- 
sulfur coal." 

It would seem that I&amp;M/ 
AEP is more concerned 
with polluting the news 
media with offensive ads 
that promulgate misleading 
and false Information than 
cleaning the environment. 
Based on the above infor- 
mation one can only begin 
to glimpse the perversion 
of Che definition of the term 
" environmentalist " as 
used by I&amp;M/AEP. Cer- 
calnly one would expect 
that an environmentally en- 
lighcened and concerned 
company (for at least 30 
years) would have develop- 
ed non-polluting plants or 
spent more money on re- 
search for pollution abate-

ment equipment than on 
advertising. 

The antiquated, rape-the- 
envlronment mentality of 
I&amp;M/AEP as well as the 
entire power Industry must 
be changed. No longer can 
we afford the luxury of a 
laissez-faire policy con- 
cerning the environment. 

According to the Federal 
Power Commission, 51% of 
212 major electric utilities 
did not spend one cent on 
research and development. 
In contrast, advertislngand 
other expenses by Inves- 
tor-owned utilities amount 
to eight times as much as 
industries expenditures on 
R&amp;D. 

In August of 1970, Presi- 
dent Nixon's science ad- 
visors. The Office of Sci- 
ence and Technology, in a 
report entitled, "Electric 
Power and the Environ- 
ment" stated "Thegeneral 
level of research and de- 
velopment expendlcures by 
electric utilities, and par- 
ticularly in reopect to en- 
vironmental matters is far 
below an appropriate level 
for an industry of this 
size." 

On March 24, 1972, I&amp;M 
was awarded a rate in- 
crease by the Public Ser- 
vice Commission of Indi- 
ana (Cause No. 32735). No- 
where in the analyois of 
I&amp;M's petition by the PSC 
was there any mention of 
funds for advertising. I: 
Is mentioned that the "Pe- 
titioner (I&amp;M) is faced with 
the largest construction 
program in Us corporate 
history In order to ade- 
quately and reliably meet 
the ever growing require- 
ments for electric power 
by its customers.. .In ad- 
dition, Petitioner will be 
required to make capital 
expenditures of millions of 
dollars In order to cumply 
with the environmental re- 



quirements of regularatory 
bodies having jurisdiction 
over pollution control In its 
various forms." 

Perhaps it is not too late 
to convince I&amp;M/AEP to 
halt the proposed adver- 
tising campaign and use 
the public's money con- 
structively for pollution a- 
batement, for seeing to It 
Chat their equipment func- 
tions at the designed per- 
formance levels rather 
than below them. 

By their own admission, 
as brought out in the PSC 
report, I&amp;M is being forced 
to comply with State and 
Federal regulations. If not 
for these laws, which are 
designed to protect the 
health and property of the 
public, I&amp;M would not spend 
the money on pollution a- 
batemenc. 

They claim co have been 
environmencallsts for 30 
years. I can only conclude 
that I&amp;M/AEP hasbeenand 
Is an environmentally ir- 
responsible company, and 
if their present advertise- 
ments are any Indication 
of the future, they will con- 
tinue to be environmentally 
Irresponsible. Fortunately 
there are truly "con- 
cerned individuals" as well 
as a more environmentally 
enlightened Government 
ready, able, and willing to 
set and enforce standards 
with which I&amp;M/AEP will 
be required to comply. 

"Say little and do much, 
for by your deeds shall you 
be judged" Is an old re- 
ligious injunction, I&amp;M/ 
AEP apparently Eielleve In 
saying much and doing as 
little as possible. They 
have been judged by en- 
vironmentalists, the Pub- 
lic, the Covermnent (why 
else the standards?) and 
have been found wanting,
