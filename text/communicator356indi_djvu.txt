Report. The depanmem of enginceiini; of IPFW licd 
wlih sii olhcr colleges for ihc 3]rcl ranking under (he 
Best Urdeigraduire Engineering Programi. 

The magazine's annual edition of "America's Bcsl 
Colleges" lined ihe whool as having ihe best rspuWiion 
among Ihe fourth lier of Regional Univcrsilics from [he 
Midwest. On o scale of I lo 5 wilh 5 being Ihe highesi, 
Indian a- Purdue Fort Wayne received a score of 3 for its 
academic rcpuuiion. The tanking uos die highcii 
among all considered wilhin Ihc fourth lier. 

Despile ils rcpu union and ranking, fourth lici 
placcmeni for IPFW carries mixed implicacions.Vlce- 
Chanccllor of Sludcnl Affaiis Susan Hannah said [he 
ranking is "a function of [he sccre[ formula (hey use lu 
pu[ people in one liei or anolhcr," 

Hannah eiplaincd [ha[ placcmcn[ of schools in 
highei or lower liers is based on designs of Iradilional 
mslilulions in which acceptance ia[cs arc signilicanlly 
loner dian those of IPRV, 

U.S. News &amp; WiHid Report cited IPFW as having 
Ihc second lowest graduaiion lale ( 17%) of all schools 
in Ihc fourth lier. Indiana- Purdue Rin Wayne was con- 



ago Stale Univcrsily : 
Indiana Univcrsily's Kokomo. Northwesi. South Bend, 
and Sou[heas[ loealion.h, along with several others in [he 
Midwest. 

'X}ur mission ii to be accessible, so we ukc most 
oFlhettudents who apply to us.. .ihc acceptance rale is 
necessarily high and the graduaiion rate is neccuarily 
low." IJannah said. Shcadded ihal a significanl number 
of studenu ate lost in the first semester because diey 
choose not to do the necessary uotk. 

"We're proud of what we do." Hannah said "We 
give students a chance. But because of that we'll aluays 
be doomed lo be in [he fourth liet," She added thai in 
order lo move up lo a higher tier, all the university 
would have to do is deny appliealions for enrollment 
more fiequenlly. 

"We do not want to do that." Hannah said. 
According to ihe magazine, academic reputation is 
given Ihe greatest amount ofconsideration In a school's 
tanking b«:ausc ",..a degree from a distinguished col- 
lege so clearly helps giaduaics gel good jobs or gain 
admission lo top grsduale progiams. The rcpulation sur- 
vey also allows lop academics lo account for intangi- 
bles. sucH as faculty dedication id tcuhing." Academic 
reputation accounted for 25 percent of thejolal weight 
in a school's analyution, and was detemiined by "sur-

Student Body Programming Director Jencc' 
Johnson said [he ranking is "really sad," in lighl of the 

facilities. "Tlie U.S. News &amp; World Repon people pnab- 
ably haven'l been to IPFW," Johnson said. "1 think if 
they'd just visil they'd get something entirely differerl. 
You get opportunities here you don't gel on larger cam- 
In 1999, 5i percent of IPFW's classes had fewer 
than 20studcnu, while 3 percent of all classes had more 
than SO siudcnls. Additionally. IPf^V's website indi- 
cates thai SO percent of all elates have fewer than 30 
siudents.Jhe student- faculty ralio is 16:1. wilh 76 per- 
cent of Ihe faculty being full-time. 

IPFW accepted 96 percenl of its applicants in 
1999. Hannah de,«:nbed IPFW as holding n "wonderful 
paradox." in that Ihc school is open to most people but 
high academic standards prevail. "It's sad ihal Ihe for- 
mula does not recognize die diversity of missions. The 

find Ihal very narrow," Hannah remarked. "Regional 
universiiies," as cuplained by the magazine, are defined 
by the Carnegie Foundation as schools which offer a 
good variety of undergraduate and master's programs

and teachings. 

Nyanissara listed philosophy, enlighten- 
ment and teaching as three important aspects of 
the Buddhist u-adilion and defined select con- 
cepts such as Thera. 'Thcra means great elder 
dibciplc of (he law of Buddha, Our tradition 
derives from this Thera." he said. 

Ac^iording to Nyanissara. "We should not 
icmox any original idea from Ihe Buddha's 
teachings We should not insert any new idea 
into the Buddha's teachings. We should not 
change any of Buddha's teachings." 

Nyaniisara weni to compare Buddhist 
monks in Myanmar and the monks in Japan. 
"Buddhas arc nol allowed lo cal after 12 noon, 
only to drink, but not alcohol. Japanese monks 
have wives and children, can eai at any hour 
and dnnk alcohol." he said. 

According to Nyanissara. Buddha only 
taught Dhamma and all of Buddha's teachings 
are called Dhamma. They include 1. Ethical 
teachings for all, 2. Rules of regulation for nuns 
and monks, 3. PsycholOEical and ohvsical 
teachings for i" Itt addition, he divided 
Dhamma into diree stages. The first one was 
Silo, iranslaled by some scholars as morality. 
Nyanissara described it as Ihe discipline to con- 
tral Ihe body and speech ordiscipline to control 
bodily action such as killing, disturbing other's 
happiness and commilling evil actions in gen- 

The second une was Samadhi, translated 
by most scholars as concentration, and 
described by him as the control of menial 
actions. The third stage thai mokes up Dhamma 
is Paiuia. or linguistic study, "These languages 
were used 2000 years ago in the time of lonj 
Buddha, just like Latin, PaHilii means to learn. 
10 understand in detail our education so that we 
can study ourselves." 

He concluded his presentauon by empha- 
sizing Ihc practice of Ihe three stages of

about being Division I

will be good for the school 
in the long run."
