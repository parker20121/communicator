Conversations are held weekly 
and, according to Gates, are 
catered "toward folks who may 
not be Christians but who are 
spiritually curious." 

The Conversations are 
topic-centered and student- 
led small groups are formed 
for more personal discussion. 
"What students will find at 
these meetings is acceptance, 



toleranceof diversity of opinion, 
potential friendship and a brief 
presentation of what the Bible 
says about a particular topic." 
Gates said. 

On the third Thursday of 
every month, Campus Ministry 
sponsors a University Religious

Radford." 

Although Villalon lives 
far from campus, .she enjoys 
serving as president of the 
student association. 

She is a Spanish teaching 
major with a minor in music 
and has been attending IPFW 
since the fall of 2002. 

She revealed part of her life 
saying, "I live in Akron, Indiana,

Villalon also explained how 
the DiversEquality student 
organization was founded. 

"Fernanda and I are the 
organizers and founders of the 
group as well as the officers. 
We just started last year. We 
took over the existing group- 
Coalition for Social Justice." 

Villalon stressed the 
organizations importance. 

"I believe that our group is 
very important for the IPFW 
campus as well as the general 
public because our main goal 
is trying to educate those that 
may seem different from them 
which in turn brings people to a 
better understanding of others 
and brings down stereotypes." 

The group is organizing a 
number of events focused 
on dispelling the stereotypes 
which abound in our society. 
Villalon was excited about IPFW 
Idol, one of the events they are 
planning.

Aggies open 
Texas' eyes 

By Phillip Orchard 

(University of Texai) 



through the A&amp;M campus 
before last Saturday's 40-29 
Texas victory, there was an 
odd and unprecedented mix of 
resignation and submissiveness 
itamongAggie fans 



Aggies openly lamented about 
the season and still more 
seemed a little bit too willing to 
praise the Longhorns. 

s if a great malaise 



! \2 years or the rivalry. 

Thestadium atmosphere was 
almost worse, capped when the 
anticipated finale to the Reggie 
McNeal/Vince Young rivalry 
that never really materialized, 
limped to an anticiimactic 
ending when Reggie McNeal 
hobbled in jeans through Senior 
Day introductions, officially 
passing the reins to the 3-and- 
out Gulf Coast offense to gutsy 
and talented Stephen McGee. 

But four hours later in post- 
game interviews, the attitudes 
had switched. 

Supposedly a pocket passer, 
McGee had sliced through the 
Texas defense for 108 yards on 
the ground. Supposedly the 
best player in college football, 
Vince Young had his worst game 

fheAggieshavesomethingto 
talk about during the offseason 
(which, at 5-6, started Saturday 
afternoon). The Longhorns 
have several tilings to work on 
before taking on what could be 
the most talented backfield in 
college football history. 

Texas had beaten their rival 
for the sixth consecutive time 
on die road in front of a raucous 
crowd, but didn't win by the 
76-point margin many had 
predicted, and the result was 
an odd mix of apprehension 
and relief. Struggling al Kyle 
Field was a good thing, right? 
Anyone? "It's not good to have 
it easy all the time," fullback 
Ahmard Mall said. 

"I think it's the best thing that 
could possibly happen," Mack 
Brown said. "It got our guys' 
attention so we can quit talking 
about how good we are." 

They're right. It was. Texas 
won by 1 1 without Vince being 
Vince. If that's Texas' worst 
game of the season, this year 
will be a smashing success. 

Fact: After winning the 
previous eight games by an 
average of more than 37 points. 
Texas needed a close game. 

Truth: Neither USC or 
Colorado will run the option, 



leak in the Texas run defense. 

Baldfaced lie: Vince Young 
is clearly the second-most- 
deserving Heisman candidate 
in college lootball. 

While it's true that Friday's 
struggles only added fuel to the 
nation's Reggie Bush lovefest 
and in all likelihood secured 
Bush the victory, the two should 
be neck and neck heading into 
next weekend. 

It's only Young's second 
average game this season (in 
the other, Rice, Young was 
effectively out of the game 
before the third quarter ended). 
His only real mistake was the 
third-quarter fumble, and his 
interception was a blatant pass 



with fewer than 100 yard: 
the ground, three where he 
didn't score at all, and he simply 
doesn't carry his team the way 
Young carries Texas. His most 
recent signature performance 
came against Fresno State (who 
lost to Nevada on Saturday), 



yard average) and a crucial 
fourth quarter fumble which 
nearly lost the game. 

"Looking at the numbers 
from what Reggie did last week 
and Vince did today, Reggie 
probably leads," he said. "But

Cindy Sheehan took the stage. 

Across from the protestors,

cameras swarmed around 



groups present, 



home from Iraq. 

After her son Casey's death 
in 2004, Sheehan camped o 



front of President Bush's ranch 
demanding a private meeting 
with the president to ask him 



bring the military troops back 
borne as soon as possible. 

Sheehan began speaking at 
7:30p.m. when two men wearing 
ski masks ran to the front of 
the stage holding a banner 
reading, "Al-Qaeda Approved." 
The unidentified men quickly 
ran out of the auditorium as 
audience members booed their 
actions and security guards 
chased after them. 

A young man and woman 
also stood up against Sheehan 
holding a banner that read,

Sheehan began her talk by 
discussing how the holiday

many families in the United 
States and Iraq due to the loss 
of loved ones in the war.

Ramona Hechtl, a 26-year-old

"Essentially, what we are doing is

done on campus," Bales said. 

One idea already being implemented 
by the University Police Department is 
increasing the amount of police on duty, 
especially around McKinley Avenue 
where most of the verbal assaults have 
occurred. However, Director of Public 
Safety Gene Burton said it would take a 
"Stroke of luck" for an officer to actually 
witness the harassment. Despite the 
difficulties, he said it was important the

they would be punished. 

However, the perpetrators could 
be community members, and the acts 
of the individuals do not reflect the 
university altitude, she said. 

"The climate of the campus would 
suggest this is really not indicative of our 
campus, and it is important we come 
together and try to identify who really 
are these people who committed these 
acts," Bales said. 

As a substitute teacher in the Muncie,

very good, very unique album.

best song, featured is a unique combination 
of instruments, what sounds like some sort of 
tambourine and some exotic strings instrument. 
I he vocals are soothing, and at one point almost 
sound like tlu.-v come out of an opera. But even 
though this song seems to be the defining point 
ol i lit- album, the rest of the tracks are definitely 
worth listening on for.

that has touched the lives of thousands in his

and play the auto-harp Sadly lor her, by die 
time they began filming, lime Carter Cash 
had already passed on. leaving Withcrspoon

As far as the plot goes, I couldn't even begin 
to tell you whether or not it was accurate. I 
only assume it was because Johnny. lutle and

"Inside the Walls of l-olsum Prison." Once he got 
out, Cash married Vivian Liberto (played very 



well by Cinniter ( loodwin-she was in "Mona 
Lisa Smile") and. before their divorce, had four 
daughters. 

Cash starts meagerly as a door-to-door 
salesman. He soon grows confident and 
approaches a label. Obviously, the label was 
impressed, but not at first. They thought he 
was too nice, as he was singing primarily gospel

first divorce and tier second were finalized, they 
married. 

It was not all candy and valentines, however. 
Cash grew dependent on barbiturates and 
amphetamines. I le even did lime because of it

No, not their crazy sounding languages, I'm talking about their

Surely many bands envy the genius that flows through the

not new to the United states though: they are far from unknown 
to anyone who attends die annual Warped lour Don't worry, they

Publishing company HarperCollins is 
rewriting history. A photo featured on the 
back of the classic children's tale "Goodnight 
Moon" has been digitally altered to be more 
(as HarperCollins sees it) child -friendly. 

In the photo, which has been printed 
in editions of (he story for almost 60 years, 
Clement Hurd, the illustrator of the story 
and recreational nicotine user, was smoking 
a cigarette at the moment of photographic 

In a New York Times article by 
Edward Wyan, the editor in chief of the 
HarperCollins children's book division, 
Kate Jackson, claimed the cigarette sends 

"potentially harmful message to very

has taken it upon themselves to alter the 

legacy nl this man 

" mof history isappalling

That would mean the Holocaust didn't

This photographic faux pas is not an 
isolated incident. Just as despicable was

Can it be true that a single image of 



children of HarperCollins, Spielberg's decision is 
still unsettling. The culture of the 1980s 
was more accepting of firearms and the

What benefit is wrought from this 
refashioning of culture to fit the present

we can learn from our prior missteps are

The notion that children are focused 

more on the picture of a book's illustrator

gun is unacceptable is absurd. 

But, by far, most ludicrous is the notion 



of our culture that a select few deem 
appropriate.

clearly out-hustling Michigan State's bench 
players. 

This wasn't "clean up " or "garbage time, 'either. 
Izzo was furious at the lack of effort, calling out 
players in his posr game press conference. 

Sprinkled in between all of these hustle plays 
were more hustle plays and more dives and 
shoulders and elbows being thrown.

Rant No. I — The power of my article??? 

If you've read me for the last three weeks, you should know I 



i the only thing I remember 
is Quintin Carouihers' ,il|ry-hoop dunk to start the game. But I 
attended the in-state rival ,md sin mid -be u ml eience game against 
Valparaiso, and there was a certain change in this game. 

I will talk a lot more about the game in general, but there 
was something different going on, there were actually student 
contests!!! Not just one hut several. I was shocked, it was either the 
beer or I thought I was somewhere else there for a little while. 

I also noticed the cheerleaders were gone Irom our end too, 
probably the best move ever. 1 caul stand hearing "Shoot For Two" 
and "Basket" from the cheerleaders when ihe\ are 100 feet away 
from me. much less five feet. 

We also have the best damn mascot in college. I'd put Don 
against the San Diego thicken, lie's that good. I noticed he 
changed his song and sbll did a damn good job out there. It was 
refreshing, but I'm going to put in a request for some Dirty Diana 



feet awav from the visiting bench. 

Now. they are helping us out. It's a thing of beauty in that people 
are finally starting to support us If we can only get in a conference, 
our numbers would he a lot better. 

Also, Iamstamngihe campaign for I VWiit Scott for Independent 
Newcomer of the War. I think he may be our most solid all around 
player right now. Me never really does anything that impresses me, 
but does all the little things thai are integral in games. 

If the team can keep competing, more people will come out 
and see us. But people, never lorget the guvs who have been there 
through thick and thin (mostly ihmi, the Him- and Brew Crew. 

There were still a lew things that irked me. 

We played a little out of control against Valparaiso. We played 
too up-tempo at times, running down the court on one-on- 
one situations in which we just took a bad shot or committed a 
turnover. We looked decent at limes in our half-court offense; we 
just need to let it come to us. 

Turnovers are another thing We made so many stupid errors it 
wasn't funny. Those are always a pan of the game, but a lot of them 
were rushed decisions and cost us the game at the end. 

Also, our interior defense is still bad. I heir big guy killed us: I 
wish we had h'"

Questions 

I was actually asked s 



e qiiestinns this week, by si 



Thought No. 1 — Men's Basketball against Valparaiso 

I have to give some credit now. I predicted the men's team 
would go o-22 this year. Now, I still stick by dial, hut I have noticed 
something pretty early with them, (hey play » ith a lot of grit, kind 
of like how their coach used to play. 

In the past couple years, we would have rolled over and died 
after we fell down 17-2 to Loyola-Chicago and trailed by 15 to 
Valparaiso, but in both games we lought back. I think a lot of credit 
has to go to Coach Dane life lies animated on the bench and I 
think he's getting way more from the players he has than me or 
anyone else in the Blue and Brew ( ivw expected. 

He even won a road game his lirsi win as a coach. An esteemed 
colleague ol mine pointed nut thai we halted a ! r ,-game road losing 
streak which extended back to February 2, 2003. Now, we had won 
a few neutral site games in that span, but no true road contests. 

If Fife can keep gelling the maximum effort out of these guys, 
we may win a few more games than expected. Hell, we should be 
3-0 this year (not counting the Huntington College exhibition) 
because every game was ours to win. 

The crowd this year has been better than I expected. In the past, 



Michigan State overrated;' I Ml yes. Indiana will eat them inside if 
and when il guts a healthy HI White back. 

I predicted that Michigan States Paid Davis would have a huge 
game, and he ditl with .50 points and 14 rebounds. We are really 
missing a big man, as you can tell from above. 

I was impressed with the arena and their band was a thousand 
times better than ours (not only in playing but cheering). Plus, 
watching a cheer and dance team with uniforms that fit and 
routines that are flawless was amazing. 

Other than that, we played better than my expectations. I 
almost think we could start a smaller lineup against some teams 



will he our starter ai point guard m .whrn- down the line. 

I think we could even pull an upset against a Purdue or Penn 
State. But perhaps. I'm the only one thinking that. 



rthem as best as I c 
I.) Why dn people mispronounce IPFW on 
media, saying II Il'l )l. UJl'U-.-W, boil Wayne lUI'U.i 



part is, who actually knows us outside of Northeast Indiana? 
Probably not many, so until we make it big they will continue to 
t with a giant elephant on its 



e heard this before tot 



e any post 



Predictions 

I will start making predictions of IPFW r 

basketball games throughout the year, just to v 



season tournaments^' I ove the article - Kyle S. 

In one word, no. We won't make an NCAA t 
we join a conference, which seems like we have been searching 
forever and still no signs ol joining one Beyond the MAC taking 
us as a provisional member in some sports, 1 can't see them taking 
us in basketball. So. lor now well play in road games and just play 
for glory. 

3.) Fabtana Sou/a your thoughts...— Dirk B, 

Weird question, hut i| yim read my article you should know 
what I think of her 1 wish her the best in her future as Nick West's 
wife or whatever else she decides to do. 

That's it for this week. I'm up to II on my beer count at the 
men's home games and it's (lowing pretty damn smooth so far, as it 
is for my Blue and Drew i rew brothers Keep asking crap questions 
and I might answer them.

Notebook 



the IPFW-Michigan Slalc niinii' 
lasi Sunday was nothing new. 
After all, he played at Indiana 
University for four years in 

often filled all 17,000 Assembly 



2002 NCAA Finals in front of 
even more. But for some 1PFW 
players, this was the big-time, 

On top of playing in front 
of such a large crowd, the 
Mastodons faced the No. 12- 
ranked team in the country 
that made a trip to the 2005 



For 1PFW junior guard 
Quint in Carouthers, who scored 
10 points, knowing ' 



"That gave megousebumps," 
he said. 

Best nearly goes all the way 
Looking at Tyler Best's stat 
line for the game box score, 
the center's 2-for-13 shooting 
performance seems quite 
abysmal. But move your eyes 
about six inches to the right 
and the number 36 pops out of 

That is the number of 
minutes Best played out of 40. 
He played 34 of those straight, 
including the entire first half.

a very good job," Michigan State 
coach Tom Izzo said. "Best,

Best often got the ball in 
the deep right post-position 
and backed down larger 
Spartan defenders, leaving 
many Mastodons open on 
the perimeter for a 12-of-25 
shooting performance from 
behind the arc. 

If he took the shot for 
himself. Best was able to do a 
series of up-and-undcr moves 
to create his own shot. But the 
baskets just didn't fall, many 
of them because the 6-foot-9, 
240-pounder was out of gas late 
In the game. 

He didn't get his first break 
until 5:54 left in the second half 
when Armend Ademi replaced 
him. Ademi left Spartan guard 
Maurice Ager open on a 
backdoor pick -and -roll alley- 
oop and Fife sent Best back in 
at the 3:37 mark. 

Best finished with 1 1 points, 
six rebounds and two steals. 

Savely provides spark 

Guard Kyle Savely scored 12 
of IPFW's 24 bench points in 16 
minutes played. 

The freshman looked 
impressive manning the point 
guard position and breaking a 
Michigan State press (hat was 
applied for about one-third of 
the game. He made hustle plays

but the Mastodons stayed 
in the game. Michigan Stale 



took a 29-28 lead. The

"I think you have to give 
(IPFW) credit," Izzo said. "Our 
defense was not good at times, 
but then they even hit shots 

The Spartans came out in 
the second half and showed 
why it is perhaps the best team 
in the Big Ten, pushing the lead 
to 22 before the Mastodons 
cut the lead in half by the end, 
thanks to superb play from 
the bench. IPFW continued to 
shoot well from the field in the 
half, finishing 12-of-25 



.unl gui good shots." 

The game had some 
personal meaning for Fife and 
junior Quintin Carouthers. 
Fife, who grew up in Michigan 
and was recruited heavily by 
Izzo at Michigan State before 
choosing Indiana, was given 
applause during warm-ups and 



"It was great to be able to 
come back to Michigan and 
coach in front of my family and 
friends," Fife said. "I consider 
my home to be in Indiana now, 
but it was great to come back 
and be able to coach here." 

For Carouthers, a Flint, MI 
native, playing just 50 miles 
away from his hometown in 
front of 14,759 fans got him 
ready to play even before the 



hurt 



the 



Valpo game but came out today 
and played well," Fife said. "It 
meant something extra for him 

The loss to the Spartans 
drops IPFW to 1-3, but the 
growth of the Mastodons 
was clearly on display in East 
Lansing. Whether it was holding 
a lead for the majority of the first 
half, coming back from a 22- 
point deficit in the second half, 
or showing more hustle than 
Michigan State at times. IPFW 
is showing its improvement 
every game. 

"Back in the spring, I didn't 
think we had a chance to win 
a game," Fife said. "Well, we've 
won one, now we have a chance 
to win another at Toledo (on 
Wednesday, Nov. 30). Our kids 
have gotten so much better 
since the spring and I can't tell 
you how proud 1 am for having 
to go through what they went 
through, come together with 
eleven new guys, and become a 
team. I thinkwearerightwhere 
we thought we'd be." 



Does anyone pay attention here? 



Cup of J 



campus that just like to get free stuff 
then not come to any IPFW events. 
Take for example the night of the 



Notre Dame at the Memorial Coliseum. 

Pope knew full well we had never 
even gotten close to that amount of 
students al a men'- basketball game, but 
his thinking was on the line of, "This 
is the biggest game in IPFW history, 
I'm sure more students will come out.

A few weeks ago. n was Homecoming 
week. Now 1 disagree with some of the 
ideas [bat SAB has [theme days? What 
is this, high school 7 ), but they came out 



shirts weni like wildfire, so I would think 
there would be a "Sea of White" at the 
weekend sporting events. 

Ha! Boy, was I mistaken. Evidently, 



bunch o( freeloaders &lt; 



of interested students &lt; 
giant pumpkin get dropped on the car, 
but after that, where did everyone go? 
Yeah, I know it was about 20 degrees 
out, but there was a heated, enclosed 
tent where the band was playing. This 
band is good, everyone missed out. Nice 
student support folks. 

Even worse yvas the night after, a 
home men's volleyball game and then 
a concert by Dave and Rae, perhaps the 
best cover band in the Midwest. By my 
count, over two dozen people were in 
attendance, two dozen! 

That's amazing and embarrassing. 
You think Dave and Rae will ever come 
here again? I'm sure word will spread 
that IPFW student involvement is a joke 
and SAB or anyone else will not be able 
to bring other bands here. 

Last time I checked we have some 
of the top volleyball programs in the 
Midwest, and our men's basketball team 
is coached by Michigan native 
former 1U basketball player Dane Fife. 

Our women's soccer team won their 
conference tournament just over a 
month ago. IPFW is lame? Maybe it's 
the student body that makes us get that 
moniker, not athletics or SAB events. 

1 am the vice-president of MIA. the 
organization that tried to get more 



hours to attempt to get peoph 
events, and you know what? 

I'm tired of doing it, because no one 
cares. If we need to bribe people with 
free t-shirts and other stuff, that's a juke. 
Everyone makes fun of IPFW for being 



lame, but where are the people that want 
to make it better? I'd like to see students 
get off their asses and actually come out 



You waul to just go to school and not 
get involved? Then transfer your crap 
credits across the street to Ivy Tech, they 
are always looking for people with no 
drive and commitment to anyone but 
themselves. 

Press releases 

As The Communicator sports editor 
and an avid follower of IPFW sports, 
1 have to address something that has 
bothered me lor quite some time. 

On Sunday, the IPFW men's basketball 
team gave No, 12-ranked Michigan Slate 
a run for its money in an 84-73 loss. 
Despite being at ihe game and being 
supplied slats by the Spartan Athletic 
Department, 1 still like to check out 
what the IPFW athleiics website says, 
mostly for humor due to the writing and 



had a 13-3 run then hit a two-pointer to 
make it 15-3. but NO. A three-point shot 
by Michigan Slate's Maurice Ager made 






For instance, the first sentence of the 
game press release reads as follows, "A 
13-3 run, midway through the second 
half, helped the !2th ranked Spartans 
of Michigan State hold off IPFW, 84-73, 
on Sunday afternoon in Last Linsing. 
Michigan." Now folks, count with me, 
how many commas are in this sentence? 
Five. To anyone with a grasp of basic 
punctuation rules, three commas are 
needed. No wonder people do not take 
IPFW seriously. 

Also, there was never, NEVER a 13-3 
run by Michigan State in the second 
half. From the 12:48 mark all the way 
to the 7:13 mark in the second half the 
Spartans went on a 15-3 run on the 
Mastodons. 

You may be thinking, oh ok, they 



also cited in the press release were 
also inaccurate. In the comment that, 
"IPFW's lead vanished at the 2:52 mark, 
as the Spartans went on an 8-2 run to 
go into halftime up, 36-30." there are 
further mistakes. 

Michigan Stale trailed 28-24 with 3:44 
remaining in ihe half, then took a 36-30 
lead into the break. By my math, that 
transcends into a 12-2 run. 

Am 1 done? Not quite. 

The press release says that. "IPFW 
closed [he game out on a 7-0 run- 
but IPFW would Tall to the 12th ranked 
Spartans by eleven " First off, the run was 
11-0. Secondly, universal style writing 
says thai any number over nine will be 
put in numerical form. So, instead of 
eleven, it should say, 1 1 . 

I could go on and on, citing many 
other press releases, but 1 think this is 
enough loget my point across. My point? 
You want to be professional? Make sure 
you have ZERO inaccuracies in your 
stories and use proper writing styles. 

Is this a personal agenda for n 



the author. 

Flow do we get IPFW do be taken 
seriously? Lei's siart with the small
