An appeal to youth 

Deor Editors 

This is an appeal to the youlh 
from onother very disillusioned youth 
who oiked lh« Fort Way^E Police 
Oepr. (or help and met with total 
apothy. 

Glen Waller cetebtoted his 21st 
birlhdoy last week ord his mother 
sent him a 2 month old while German 
Shepherd oir ftoight fronLos Angeles, 
wh.ch IS no cheap ride. He picked 
up the puppy on Friday. Sunday, 
she wos stolen out of his cor in the 
parking lot of the Waffle House o" 
Highwoy 24. 

After searching the orea, Glen 
returned home and called the police. 
Two patrolmen were sent to check on 
his story. Once they sow him or 
rather sow his long hair, the only 
thing that interested them was how 
soon the/ could get owoy. 

They denied knowing the loca- 
lionof llie Waffle House, got onnoy- 
ed when ihey had trouble understand- 
ing Glen's British accent,said they'd 
fill out report, and left, hb colled 
the rodio and television stations, 
ond Ihey told him they couldn't 



^ the 



1 the 



i talk 



maybe if he called in 
show, Ihey could help. 

So, I advised him to tell the 
Communicator, Free Press, and other 



All we're asking is thot you 
watch for the puppy. While German 
Shepherds ore roro dogs, and if any- 
one should catch sight oF one thot 
looks two months old, please call 
either 4B3-8397 and ask (or Karen, 
or 438-7908 and ask (or Glen.

Commenls to Mrs, Leffers 

Dear Editors. 
Mrs. M.J. Leffers. 

I would like to moke o few com- 

your letter that was printed in the 
December 10, 1971 issue of the 
COMMUNICATOR. Yoo soid -How- 



^0 the editors- 



who I 



nseless and destructive to let our 
luntry be led into Onorchy which is 
I hove if all of us put 
i freedoms above 
How can 
inal state- 






Any c 



ty I 



surh hos 



olleclive is only a group of jndi- 
duol free- 
an be no 



viduols. Without "indiv 
doms" or rights, there &lt; 
"community freedoms." 
ciple of individual rights 
principle by which any 



ruly free 
who docs 
e this is ottempting to 
ruling elite the "right" 



lo dispose of the indiv 
of Ihe rest of the society. 

Mrs Leffers, I would expect a 
statement like the one you mode to 
come from Morx, Lennin, or Hitler, 
not from someone who is attempting 
to condemn onorchy. You hod best 
check your premises. One cannot 
defend Mon's rights and therefore 
freedom by using collectivis'. ol- 

Iried by such men as Jeremy Bonlhom 
ond John Stuart Mills (19th century 
philosophers). They hove all foiled 
dismally. 

If you wont lo save this coun- 
try from onorchy you will first hove 
to stop using and believing in the 
anarchist's slogons and principles. 
Only those who uphold eoch mon's 
individual rights can claim to de- 
fend freedom.

They ore muddling up ihe spirit of 
Christmas with such things os

The ACLU has also spoken out 
against "Christmos" as the name 
for our holiday, because il is biased. 
Afte' all, why should this celebra-

Frosty the Snowman or Santo Claus?

A speciol session of the Stu-

The Student Senate is in recess

LaCoia, "The Hunt", will be 
shown today on campus. This arrest- 
ing allegory Finds three veterans of 
the Spanish Civil War reunited while 
rabbit hunting in the some hills in 
which they had fought. Each has 
chonged since (hot war when the 
quarry they pursued was other men. 
While outwardly friendly, each 
of Ihe former comrades harbor re- 

the surface. Gradually, os the huni 
progresses, Ihc selfish aims oF each

Lo Coio was named one oF Ihc 
ten best films of 1967 b'y Ihe Not- 
ional Board ol Review and Ihe New 
York Times. The Fi Im will be shown 
at 4 30. 7 ond 9 30 p.m. in room 146. 



One of the most educa- 
tional portions of PIT's 
academic year will be 
presented beginning this 
evening. One-act plays 
directed oy students, en- 
acted by students, and 
in two cases written by 
students, will be presen- 
ted in^two segments. 

Tonight and Saturday, 
four plays and a dance ' 
interpretation will be 
presented. ^^^ p , ^^^ ^^^ 

"The aiind Men" directed 
by Jeff Gibson; "The Long w 
Stay Cut Short" directed e 
by Sliyi I Moorman; "Sky- i 
dird" written by student 
Marvin Ramage and directed 
by Rick Benz; and"Holiday 
in Gold Dust" written by 
5+udent Steve Keenan and 
directed by Steve McAfee. 
The dance segment is dir- 
ected by Charles Allen. 

Tuesday Dec. 2l5t and 
Wednesday Dec. 22nd, the 
performances featured are: 
"Hello from Bertha" dir- 
ected by David Thompson ; 
"Bus r^i ley's Back in Town" 
directed by Jim Jones; and 
"To Hell With Aunt Agatna" 
d i rected by Suzi Hoover. 

Oral Interpretation Read- 
ings will be inci uded. 

For enthusiasm, excite- 
ment, and the thrill of 
theater in its most ferti l€ 



stage, the one-act plays 
cannot be surpassed. It 
is the first time on stage, 
for some actors and act- ' 
resses. It is the acid 
test for student directors. 
It is a chance for the 
audience to see a wide 
vari ety of pi ays , and 
it is an exel lent way to 
spend a most enjoyable 
even i ng. 

For th is writer it is 
a special thrill. This is

During the course of his study,

colleges, junior colleges and uni-

he attended classes along viilh the 
students. Thrust into o role of in-

observed the difficulties facing a

Dr. Eble discovered even he could

Discussion of leaching methods with 
students revealed that the leochers 
disliked most intensely were those 
who didn't core, for the majority of

Rain, splashing, crashing, !n noisy puddles 
against the hard skin of the parking lot 
beating a stately staccato on the window' 
pane, brushing the leaves cling.ing obstinately 
to a terrified tree, running 
in rivulets past pool-Jumping pedestrian^, 
whipped wildly by the wind to spray 
and play in my face. 

Where is the snow for which I longed, I ask 

the icy statues of necklaced trees strung'wlth 
diamonds of ice, crowned with a halo of 
•frosted plumes; or the diouds, clinging 
carelessly to blue Christmas sktes? 

Where are the sparrow^ footprints against the 
mounds of white walls' pi led alongside frozen 
fences 

Or the mantled evergreens garbed in wreaths 
of spun s i I ver . 

But nothingness greets my questions, 
and the only answer is a renegade raindrop 
careening off my chin.
