-Rachel

The Glenbrook Mall has not only been 
notorious for their wide selection of clothing 
stores, but also for giving local students jobs. 
Unfortunately for many, an estimated eleven 
stores have or will be soon closing their 
location at the Glenbrook Mall. 

Reasons behind this action are because the 
mall is doubling its rem L usi while also forcing 
new renovations at the time of the lease signing 
With mall sales down, Glenbrook store leasers 
simply cannot fulfill these demands. A list of

Community Focus 



IPFW's competitive water sports team 



By Amanda Bridgman 



Student organizations at IPFW often 
go unnoticed, and when students do 
think of these clubs they usually think 
of a "chess club" or "Spanish club." 



However, The Communicator would like 
to bring to light the knowledge of the 
many student organizations that IPFW 
has to offer that cater to a broad range 
of interests. 

A quite unique, but entertaining, 
student organization is the IPFW W 



had no idea that this type of club t 
existed here at IPFW or even in Fort 
Wayne don't worry, because over half of 
the student body didn't either. The team 
currendy has only four members: Matt 
Beck, Andy Hipskind. Brian Mason and 
Wendi Plumb. The Communicator got 
an opportunity to speak with member, 
Brian Mason, and to ask some questions 
about this organization. 



difficult, but once practiced this sport 
can be extremely fun and competitive. 
This organization has been around since 
the Spring of 20(14 and was created by 
Andy Hipskind. F.ach individual team 
member ordinarily practices on their 
own, but occasionally they will all get 
together and practice as a team in 
Syracuse at Beck's lake house. Obviously 
the point of practicing is to master the 
sport and compete in tournaments. 
The team travels to Ohio and Illinois 
for about three or four tournaments a 
year. Only 40 minutes away, Van Wert, 
Ohio hosts a large tournament on their 
private Pleasant Shores Lake for Midwest 
schools' water-ski &amp; wakeboard teams.

SUNNY DAYS: IPFW students, Matt Beck and Wendi Plumb take a 
break at the Ball State Fling tournament. 



Surprisingly, many Big Team schools 
have their own teams and they head to 
these competitions. For example, IPFW 
will compete against Purdue, Michigan 



Their schedule generally is waking 
up Saturday to compete, followed by a 
fun night of camping out and mingling 
with the teams, followed by more skiing 



finally heading back home. There are the website a 
&gt; Wilmington, Illinois three events that take place: the Slalom 
competition, Trick competition and 



"We would do better if we 
are people and could probably 
a lot higher," states Mason 



"These weekends at 
have been my most memorable 
experiences in college. If you like to 
ski or want to learn to ski, come join 
the IPFW Water-ski &amp; Wakeboard 
Team." Unfortunately, IPFW gives 
this student organization absolutely 
no funds to help offset the costs of 
tournaments or gear. When asked 
how the team generates money, they 
said they simply do a fundraiser, 
such as their first year when ihcy did 
a car bash. They charged people $5 
to stand there and smash an old car. 
They plan to do more each season, 
but admittedly sometimes do not 
get around to it, but if there were 
more members to support then they 
definitely would. 

Now that you know a little more 
about this unheard of organization, 
you might be interested in 
joining, however there are a few 
requirements. You must have a USA 
Water-ski Insurance card. The cost 
of this is around S25 to S30 and can 
be obtained on USAWaterski.com. 
Simply fill out the information 






n will i, 



Since there are only -I members th 
don't have a bus that lakes them 
these competitions, so they usually ji 
carpool together. For the ti 



i all of the other schools. 



how does our very own IPFW Water- 
ski &amp; Wakeboard team do in these 
tournaments? Well, they usually can 
end up placing 7" 1 or 8" 1 out of about 
15 spots, however they only have four 



i equipment because since 
the team is so small they are more 
than willing to share.

Stem cell fraud, discovery 
electrify field in past weeks 



(U-WIRE) MADISON, Wis. - A pair of dramatic 
rocked the world oi Mem i ill research to it inundations in recent 
weeks. Discovery- of fraud at a top international research center and 
a breakthrough in stem eel! cuhuringat a research facility affiliated 
with the University of Wisconsin-Madison have each jolted a field 
of research already wracked by ethical issues. 

In late December it was revealed that a Soudi Korean researcher, 
Dr. Hwang Woo Suk, famous for his expertise and discoveries on 
cloning, apparently fabricated evidence for much of his research. 

While the investigation is still underway, doubts have risen 
on many of Hwang-, other claims ihai have made him a famous 
name. His claims have also been published in many U.S. scientific 
journals, most recently this past May. 

In a more hopelul development lor researchers, a science journal 
reported Wisconsin scientists working at the WiCell Research 
Institute, a private laboratory affiliated with UW-Madison, had 
developed a new ui It urine, nieihud for stem cells, the first to grow 
cells without the help of animal proteins, Jan. 1, 

To successfully grow living cells outside the body requires a 
specific mix of nutrients and growth factors, which can be obtained 
from mouse embryos. However, should stem cells be transplanted 
for human therajiv, some scientists worry dial animal viruses could 
be taken up hy human tells and infect human patients. 



"Thisisabigde.il her an smith t lie old media (hey were worried 
about animal proteins and diseases being transferred to humans," 
said Andrew Cohn, a spokesman for WiCell Research Institute. 
"When this new media is perfected, it will be much easier for the 
FDA to approve putting these cells in humans." 

Tenneille Ludwig. a UW-Madison research scientist working 
at WiCell, was a major contributor in developing this new 
breakthrough. 

"Not only can we now decontaminate existing cell lines, but we 
know we have the ability to produce new lines that never have had 
contact with animal proteins. This may be important in the use of 
future cells," Ludwig said. 

She was reluctant to comment on Hwang, but said the disclosure 
"appears to be a developing into a sad and tragic story." Ludwig 
added that what is happening in South Korea has no effect on the 
research going on at UW-Madison. 

"They are doing cloning. Nobody on the UW-Madison campus 
is involved in cloning. Ludwig said "What is happening in a lab 
halfway around the world has no impact on what is going on here, 
especially on this campus." 

Jeffrey Jones, Director of the IVF laboratory at the UW Hospital 
and Clinics, agreed with Ludwig that what is happening in South 



Korea is an isolated incident. 

"All the facts have not been out yet, so it is hard to say 
happened," lones said. "It gives the whole scientific community 
bad name, having someone who would falsify their results."

permeates everything through 
and through with gloom. 
Compared to the Thursday 
right before that, it was the 
exact opposite, a foreboding 
day that was appropriate for 



on Sept. 1 and that i 
unlucky day. ..so why is Friday 
the 13'", beyond the myths 



the 13"'. 

Friday the 13" 1 is the Black 
Friday, the most unlucky of all 



So then, why Friday the 13 ,h ? 
It is just, after all, another day. A 
day. however, steeped in legend 



s and Big Foot, but are 
any of them true? 

Startingoutwifhtheobvious. 
Friday is an unlucky day in the 
Christian world to begin with 
and the number 13 has always 
carried the stigmata of black 
cats, that is. bad luck. Friday 
has some history toil. In Pagan 
cultures, Friday was a holy day 
more often than not and is 
named after the Norse goddess 
of fertility and marriage, Freya. 
As Christian monks spread the 
faith, Friday became a negative 
day.. .it was the day Christ was 
crucified (Good Friday) and 



Day. Friday. In a more modern 
context, Britain used Fridays 
as the Hangman's Day. or the 
official day to carry out all 
Even in Rome, pre- 
istian Rome that is, Friday 
reserved for executions. So 
for at least two thousand-ish 
years, Friday was a bad day. 

But what about the 13? Norse 
culture spoke of 13 as the worse 
possible number of people for 
a meal.. .after all, the gods had 
a party of 12 and then Loki, 
the "evil" god of Norse culture, 
crashed the party and started a 
riot! Thus, the Norse believed if 
13 people came to dinner, one 
was slated to die. The Hindu 
faith also lists 13 as a number 
of death and ill luck. The 
Egyptian culture stated that life 



had 13 steps, w 

being death. And gouty hack 






the last one invited. 

So then separate, the number 
13 is bad luck and Friday is bad 
luck. Both are laced with death 
and bad dinner parties, so it 
would only be logical for die 
13 lh day to be on the most- 
unlucky Friday to just be plain 
double-unlucky. After all, two 
wrongs don't make a right... just 
a bigger, messier wrong. 



Fair (IV) of France issued the 
order to have the Holy Order of 
the Knights Templar arrested

and basically were medieval 
Catholic knights

Praeeminentiae on Dec. 10, 
1307 to begin the process of 
rounding up the surviving 
Templar and have them arrested 
on trumped-up charges. It took 
years for the Templar to be tried, 
tortured and then executed in 
1314. Clearly, this has nothing 
to do with the Friday the 13 th 

So then, why is Friday the 
13 ,hl so unlucky? A series of 
cosmic curses or coincidence 
have landed a bad name to the 
sixth day, and perhaps it really 
is the Cursed Day. 

Or perhaps it is just a 
figment of too many active 
imaginations.

Daniels illustrated how he 
and his "New Crew of reform-

able to reduce spending by over 
$200 million by basically using 
iple.

outdated maintenance 

contracts were cancelled, and 
ink pens were bought in bulk, 
just to name a few cutbacks. 
With the improved spending 
habits, Daniels is optimistic 
that, by the end of June, Indiana 
will have its first balanced 
budget in 10 years. 

Not only is Daniels trying to 
bolster the state's pocketbook.

Another area of the proposal 
would open the door for private

receive a warm reception from

Gluttons to be taxed 



Staff Editorial 



Governor Mitch Daniels gave 
his second State of the State 
Address last Wednesday evening. 
In his Address, Daniels proposed 
many new ideas that he would 
like to accomplish in 2006. 

One issue that he discussed 
was transportation. Daniels has 
the power to sell the Indiana 
Toll Road to a private fund. He 
argues that this would bring a 
large sum of money to the stale 
of Indiana. 

What Daniels doesn't mention 
in the Address is how much extra 
this will cost the numbers of 
residents that use that toll road 
every day. A private firm would

Daniels also spoke of an addi- 



tion to Interstate 69. The plan 
calls to add on to the Interstate, 
leading it to southern Indiana. 
This extension would be made 
into another toll road and there 
would also be the possibility of

smokers.

We have all been taught from a very young age that smoking 
will increase the risk ol heart attack, lime, cam cr, and various other 
health problems. In fact, there arc so many health problems that 
are treated by smoking thai listing them all and their effects would 
probably lake up my entire column. 

But people continue to smoke for various reasons ranging from 
addiction to simple pleasure,

The short answer is yes. 

Even with survival, a hemor-

thing one recovers from. Only 
25 percent of victims recover 
most function according to 
Medline Plus, a webpage start- 
ed by the U.S. National Library

the rest of the victim's life, and

Advantages of growing up; moving out 



Staff Column 



On Saturday, January T n 1 
returned to Port Wayne for my 
second semester at IPFW. As 
I said goodbye to my parents 
and my brother I'll admit it was 
miserable and somewhat dis- 
couraging. But, once I got in 
my car and started off down the

I miss being with my boyfriend. 
I miss my high school friends. I 
even miss the small town and 
small school atmosphere that I 
grew up in. 

However, living on your own 
is a valuable experience. You 
are able to decide when you 



come home, you decide what 
you eat, you decide when to 
make dinner, and you get to 
decide what you need to do 
and when to do it. Personally, I 
feel like I can sleep better when 
I'm on my own. I feel like I can 
focus better yvhen I'm not at 

There are so many new 
responsibilities that are pushed 
onto you when you first move 
out. Nevertheless, living on 
your own and experiencing the 
college life is a crucial part to 
growing up. 

Don't get me yvrong though; 
there's stress. I'll admit that 
I've been stressed. I woke up 
late one morning for practice,

I didn't do the laundry, and 
some nights I just don't feel like 
making myself dinner. I hardly

not living at home anymore.

There was also the concern 
of coming to IPFW and hard- 
ly knowing anyone. For the 
first few days I just wanted to 
go home, back to my comfort 



tple of times, when things 
have come up and I needed to 
talk to them, it has taken me a 
few hours to get ahold of them. 
Usually this has been because 
of different schedules and can't 
be helped, but it still was frus- 
trating. 

But, the advantages undeni- 
ably, without a doubt, outweigh 
the disadvantages. I love being 
on my own. I love my fam-

Michigan native White 
ready to take next step 

■ Former Toughman world champion in preparation for 
career-defining fight with Butterbean 

AskDanWhiH' whai ihe firsi words were out of his mouth when the idea of 
fighting in the Toughman tonus! was brought up to him and he will provide 
you with a quick and somewhat simple answer. 

"I was a kid in college and I was like hell veah. sign me up.'" 

Then an Olivet College wrestler, White entered his first Toughman 
competition with .1 paycheck ol SI. mil) and .1 new iip|inrnniiiy looming. Three 
and a half years later, he has parlayed that whim decision in Battle Creek, 
Michigan 111I0 ,1 new career opportunity. 

His next step in cultivating that opportunity comes March 25 when he 
battles for Tough man world champion Hulterbean in Kalamazoo. Michigan. 

In his career, While, who now dons ihe nickname "Dangerous," is 39-0 in 
Toughman contests ami likewise a former world champion Since becoming a 
pro boxer he is 10-0, a record that he is ready to put on the line against arguably 
the most famous luughman ever. 

"Right now, 1 would really light anybody," White -aid of his plans for the 
immediate future. "1 like fight inn biggii\s, I have been doing it all my life." 

Last weekend at the Fori Wayne regional longlim.m event, White was 
k position as he refereed n 



20 fights in the same ring he once battled in. He leaned into a corner between 
matches, talking with people at ringside and even inked around a bit when the 
ring girls put on ihe gloves for an exhihiion light, but while he sticks firmly to 
his Toughman roots and always willing 10 lend a helping band, he knows that 
he is in a whole lm-« ballgauic mi the professional level. 

"I didn't realize that tliere is so much skill thai is invoked in this," White said. 
"In the professional game, you really have 10 push. Your speed has to be up... 
timing is crucial." ' 

With his bout againsi butterbean 1 losing m. White has been training with 
Joe Byrd, father ol llif Heavy weighi &lt; hampion t hi is Uyrd for White, focus is 
crucial heading int.i what ma\ he the biggesi match of his career, but he also 
can't help hut to stop ami dunk aboui Ins opponeni Irom a fan's eyes. 

"This is crazy, this guy is huge. I mean, evervhodv knows Butterbean," White 
said with his eyes wide. "I fee! I can heal him. 1 know if he hits me, it's going to 
take its toll on me so my plan is just not to get hit." 

Butterbean made his mark on the world l&gt;\ being a big, yet quick striking 
boxer and is often credited with helping to get the "Original Toughman 
Contest"off the ground, Ihe contest landed a i 
the FX Network in J00I and has often featured I 
fighters. 

However, the krniei 1 hampion has losi his last lour lights and does 1 
enter a ring again before bis Kalamazoo battle with White. 

Sitting in a ringside seat before the matches started last Saturday at t 
Coliseum. White stuck to his guns, noting over and over that he knows he c 
beat Butterbean. But for now, he just warns to enjoy the ride. 

"I want to milk it (boxing) for all it is worth and take n as far as I can," Wh 
said as he hobbled his head bai k and forth."! never thought I would take it it 
far. so I might as well keep going." 



WHAT IS 'THE TOUGHMAN'?

• Participants must way at least 160 pounds. 

• Each fighter must be at least 1 8 years old. 

• Fighters wear 16 oz. gloves, head gear,

Wearing 
down

By Nick West 



The bench is thin and die 
front line rotation is thinner. 
And three starters are playing 
over 31 minutes per game. 

But IPFW men's basketball 
coach Dane Fife isn't too 
concerned. Wearing down is 
just a state of mind, he says. 

"1 don't see any of our 
players wearing down," the 
first-year coach said. "If our 
guys are competitors they 
don't think about silly things 
like that. You show up to play 
the game and you can't worry 
ahoui wearing down." 

Easy for Fife to say. He was, 
after all, named 2002 Big Ten 
Defensive Player of the Year at 
Indiana University and prided 
his play on in-your-face 
defense and diving for loose 
balls left and right. He once bit 
an opponent in a game during 
a tie-up for a loose ball. Pan of
