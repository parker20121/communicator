Politics and candidates 

The legislation of no! so many years ago that gave eighteen year-olds l he nghl 
!o vote caused .in enthusiastic regeneration of interest 111 (inhlics among Die young 
people of (hi- United Stales They were being given an actual voice 111 determining 
Ihc future course o( Die country they lived io Subsequent events put a .severe 
damper on I his enthusiasm. Voung people became deeply involved in polities, only 
tol)L(|inckly disillusioned v. lien I lieu efforts (ailed to have an immediate fifed on 
a national' level. This disillusionment was sometimes caused by a 
misunderstanding liy young people of the way the unwieldy democratic system 
works, and sometimes caused liy the many obvious delects in Hie system itself 

Whatever the cause, a great number ol voters decided that polities was not for 
them. The people who hacked McCarthy, McCovcrn and a few other 
■unconventional" candidates dropped out of I lie political scene .mil developed an 
altitude of apathy The eleclion o( Nixon .mil the awful mess that tallowed were 
erinughloennvincealntof people I hat I hey didn't want In know any more about the 
intricacies ol hip time polities lint Watergate ami every Ihing related to it should 
be more than enough to motivate every voter in an effort to keep himself more 
informed than ever before. 

If any cili/.en of the United St, .t.'s wants to have the ri|d omplain about the 

slate of the country, he ior shei should al leasl make ;in cllort to learn as much as 
possible annul I he candidates who are \&gt;in|; for the privilege of representing them 
111 Washington The only practical way Io change the society we live in is to work 
within the rules and regulations as Ihey presently exist. Changes may not be 
instantly apparent, but they con be achieved. 

Sludcntsal Indiana-Purdue University in Fort Wayne are being presented an 
excellent opportunity to question (tie candidates for the United Stales Senate and 
House of Representatives in the forthcoming elections Through the efforts of 
Student Government, all candidates will appear on campus to participate in 
informal &lt;|i]es1ion-ans\vcr sessions Mayor Lugar lias already been here, and 
Senator Havli will lie present on Mnndav, Hctnhcr 21. from ti :ill to 11:00 a.m. On 
October ZiV.S Hep J Edward Ifoush and Stale Senator Walter P. Helmke will be 
on the campus,

Unified budget m

procedures, two business office staffs, and two budgets Fiscally the situation is

Why the delay'' The answer to that &lt;|iies!ion must he a closely guarded secret. 
Few people know the answer and even fewer care In discuss it The Communicator 
has heen able In piece together the 1'iilluwmg scenario, however, and it appears to 
be [actual: 

After the super-chancellor agreement of last November, the treasurers of the 
twn universities negotiated a fiscal arrangement for the Fort Wayne Campus. This 
agreement was accepted by the Purdue Iruslees hut not by the I.U. board. 
Evidently the I.U. Iruslees did nnt have complete faith in I he Purdue business 
office Io prudently administer I lie lunils ol both universities This lack of trusl in 
Mr. Ford and Ins operation is probably well-grounded. 

To satisfy the demands of the I.U. board, (he treasurers and Chancellor 
Schwartz helan negotiating a memorandum ol understanding for the agreement 
They were saving ineflect : forget what the agreement appears to say, Ibis is wlml 
i| really means. 

Unfortunately, there is yet to emerge a perfect understanding on what the 
memorandum should say Pleasing both boards ol trustees, 1&gt;oth presidents, hold 
treasurers, and Chancellor Schwartz, iiiusl he a rather difficult task.

- highly unlikely lh.it the chancellor was being less than 
; likely is the theory that every time the parties 



involved think they have an understanding they find out they really don't. 

The fiscal agreement with Die memorandum ol understanding may or may not 
go mln effect this year This puts in doubt the implementation of a truly unified 
budget and a smgle slate appropriation for IPFW According to Purdue President 
Arthur Hansen no definite plans now exist for requesting the slate legislature Io 
allocate a single sum for the Fort Wayne Campus. 

However. Chancelhn Schwartz amid President Hansen said last Monday Ihal 
they were optimistic that the fiscal management agreement would go into effect 
soon, and they implied that truly unified budget was still a real goal of the 
universities. We hope they are right.

CAMPUS MINISTRY SURVEY 

I support the idea of a student organization called ANONYMOUS CHRISTIANS 
to explore the implications of leaving religious denominations with 
topic discussions such asi 

Is there a basis for morality? How do you feel toward your home 
Parish? ContDffversyi Religion vs. ReligiouB, Is there life 
before death? The EJtilcs of Killing for fun, profit and 
socialbillty? Exploratory Sex and Biblical Prohibitions, 
What do we do with the new life styles and bisexual morality? 
What about ethical double standards? When was the last time 
you culturally raped your neighbor? and others. 

I support the idea of a student organization called ETHICAL HUMANISTS 
to explore religious options In a non-threatening setting with Invited 
guest speakers from such groups asi 

Hind games, Esalen and the Human Sensitivity Movement, 
What does Religion have to do with life? Eastern religions, 
Black Muslims, Ath'-eists, Humanists, Scientology, Astrology

Faith Healers, Can Religion be dangerous to your health? 
Social workers as religious workers, Bars and Nightclubs as

I support the idea of a student organization called IMPACT to alert 
the Fort Wayne community and their elected officials of immediate 
decisions which affect religious liberty and human liberation or 
human survival through organized student contacts In political 
geographical districts and through churches and other groups, 

I support the idea of a student organization called STUDENTS FOR PEACE

or international and to respond quickly to such acts with alternatibeB and 
non-violent strategies or solutions. 



I support a new student organisation called STUDENT VIDEO NETWORK
