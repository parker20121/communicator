Service, concern cited 



Senate thanks Thatcher 



Two resolutions were approved 
during last Wednesday's Student 
Senate meeting and Matt Bonahoom, 
president of the Senate, announced that 
he will resign his position following 
graduation in December. 

The Senate approved Resolution K, 
which thanked James Thatcher, vice 
chancellor of financial affairs, for his 
service in helping to get the Indiana 
General Assembly to approve bonds for 
the construction of Building D and the 



health, physical education and 
recreation (HPER) building. 

The resolution also recognized 
Thatcher's concern for the safety of 
handicapped students on campus and 
his proposal to reduce the student 
Darkinefee. 

Thatcher's Lot Maintenance Fee 
proposal was submitted as a resolution 
by Steve Westrick, student senator. 
Resolution G, which would lower the 
student parking fee from $5 to $4, was 



News in brief... 

Ax-carrier nabbed 



On Tuesday night, Sept. 9, Greg 
Deratany of St. Clair Shores, Mich., 
was arrested for disorderly conduct 
at 1PFW by the Fort Wayne Police 
Department. 

Around 7 p.m., witnesses said, 
Deratany drove into the parking lot 
between Neff Hall and the con- 
struction site for Building D at a 
high speed, almost hitting several 
pedestrians. He then parked his car 
in a no parking zone, walked to the 
trunk, removed an ax and headed 
toward Neff Hall. Deratany then 
dropped the ax and fled on foot 
across the campus. 

The campus police investigating 
the incident decided to contact the 
Fort Wayne Police Department 



when Deratany failed to return to his 
car and they were unable to locale 
him. 

After a 30-minute campus-wide 
search, Deratany was found in the 
lounge of Kettler Hall. He was 
escorted back to his car by campus 
and city police officers. 

The Fort Wayne Police Depart- 
ment ran a check on Deratany and 
found he had been stopped earlier 
Tuesday morning by city police at 
the Moonraker Restaurant parking 
lot where he was beating on his own 
carwitha lead pipe. 

Deratany told the investigating 
officers he was a police detective 
from Detroit. 



Computers fallible 



ByMIKESTINSON 

A number of problems in the 
computer terminal systems have 
caused computer technology 
students long waits to use available 
equipment. 

Recently, as many as one-half of 
the 12 computer terminals in Kettler 
Hall, used by the 153 computer 
technology students, were report- 
edly "out-of-order." 

One of many problems causing the 
shut-down of systems is the 
telephone line communication which 
connects the IPFW system to the IU 
network in Bloomington or 
Indianapolis. 

The main problem with the system 
is that IPFW is so dependent on the 
IU network, and if something goes 
wrong down there, IPFW has to shut 
down, said Dennis Osborn, director 
of Computing and Data Processing 
Services. They have had many 
problems in the Bloomington- 
Indianapolis end, including elec- 
trical storms which have played 
havoc with the system. 

Osborn also said that "students 
should be more aware of other 
students using the terminals and 
report any misuse immediately. For 
each terminal that is broken, there 



Concerning "out-of-order" ter- 
minals, Osborn said, "Even if ter- 
minals have "out-of-order" signs on 
them, students should try that 
machine anyway to make sure 
someone hasn't put a sign on it to 
keep others from using it so that it 
will be available when he wants it 
again." 

Osborn said it might be feasible 
for the school to buy its own mini- 
computer to handle students' 
assignments. Although cost of a 
mini-computer would be expensive, 
the investment might well be worth 
the money. Osborn said "I can 
possibly see this coming about 
within the next five years. This is at 
least one solution to our problem." 

As far as students finding out if the 
main systems are not working, there 
should always be a bulletin posted 
outside the main door to the ter- 
minals and data processing. 

"If you don't know something 
about using the terminals, please 
feel free to ask a consultant or 
teacher's assistant. Thai's what 
they're here for," Osborn said. 
"Stupidity isn't not knowing how to 
operate one of the terminals, but 
rather, getting into trouble on one o 



is one less terminal for students to the terminals becauseyou didn't ask 
use." first." 

200 rally for 'night' 



Nearly 200 women gathered 
Saturday evening, Sept. 13, at a rally 
in Lakeside Park and marched to 
Freimann Square in an attempt to 
"Take Back the Night" in protest of 
rape and violence against women. 

"My fear is turning to anger, and 
my anger is turning to rage. No, I 
won't live my life in a cage!" the 
women sang at the rally as they 
clapped, whistled and stomped their 
feet. 

After the march to Freimann 



Square, Mary Kay Blakely, author 
and IPFW women's studies 
associate faculty member, ad- 
dressed the crowd. "A professor at 
IPFW tells his classes year after 
year that all women secretly want to 
be raped. Yet he is not even 
reprimanded because he supposedly 
has not violated any moral code." 

After Blakely spoke, the lights 
were dimmed, men were asked to 
leave and women came forward to 
speak of their own rape experiences. 



Dorm shuttle starts 



By SANDRA WILEY 

A two -week experimental shuttle 
service between the IPFW dor- 
mitories at Concordia Seminary and 
the main IPFW campus has been 
started. 

According to Jeff Sandy, the 
student senator who arranged for 
JJR Transportation to provide the 
service, and who proposed the 
resolution in the Student Senate, the 
cost of a one-way ride between the 
campus and the dorms is 25 cents. 

The shuttle service will make 12 
round-trips daily with its van -type 
bus which seats a maximum of 17 
passengers. The trips will be in the 
morning, around noon and in the 
evening. 

The service will directly benefit 
the 120 IPFW students who live in 
the dorms in at least three ways, 
said Sandy. If used daily, the $2.50 
cost for a week of transportation to 



and from classes will be cheaper 
than other forms of transportation, 
he said. 

Students will also have no parking 
problems when riding the shuttle 
bus, he noted. 

Sandy also said that in the cold 
winter months, students who use the 
service will not be bothered with 
removing snow and ice from their 
vehicles, nor will they have to ride in 
cold cars. 

A long-range effect of such a 
shuttle service may be to increase 
enrollment because of the easier 
access to dormitories by students, 
Sandy said. 

The service was officially started 
at 7:21 a.m. Monday. On hand for the 
first hording of the shuttle-bus were 
Dean of Students John Ulmer; Ann 
Momper. Students' Government 
president; Matt Bonahoom, Senate 
president; and Sandy. 



also approved Wednesday. 

According to Resolution G, faculty 
will still have the option to pay the fee 
for "B" parking or purchase an "A 
parking sticker. The new fee was 
suggested so as to eliminate student 
parking tickets and to reduce the 
workload of the Traffic Appeals Board. 

At the end of the meeting, Bonahoom 
said he will resign his position upon 
graduating in December. Steve 
Westrick, a student senator, is next in 
line for Bonahoom 's position. 

Open positions in Students' Gover- 
nment were filled by Will Wise, who 
was made a voting member of Student 
Affairs, and Chris Pyle, Norma Knoop 
and Susan Short, who were accepted as 
members of SUBOG. Standing com- 
mittee positions were also filled by Jeff 
Sandy, book store advising ; Ed Snyder, 
financial aid and scholarship; and 
Dwight Fish and Ann Momper. special 
grade appeals. 

Thirteen senators were present at the 
meeting. 

The Student Union Board of Gover- 
nors (SUBOG) also met last Wed- 
nesday. 



Preparations for "Kramer &amp; Co.," a 
traveling magic show that will perform 
in the Walb Memorial Ballroom on 
Sept. 29, were discussed by the seven 
members attending the meeting. In 
addition to the magic show at 11:45 
a.m., a teaser show is at 11 a.m. and a 
magic workshop is at 2:30 p.m. 

Funding and advertising for Terry 
Haffner, an artist who will speak on 
what it is like to be handicapped, is in 
the planning stages. SUBOG is also 
planning a plant sale this fall, but no 
date has been set. 

A suggestion to have Arvil Bird, a 
country and bluegrass fiddler, play at 
the SUBOG-sponsored hayride Oct. 17 
was left undecided. 

Terri Chambers, a counselor in the 
Student Academic Services, proposed a 
"Health and Awareness" or 
"Wellness" week to the SUBOG 
members. She suggested a week of 
activities such as a "fun run," coun- 
seling on the proper way to run and 
informative events dealing with yoga, 
aerobics, cancer prevention, en- 
vironmental awareness, alcohol and 
drug abuse and self -assert iveness. 



Plainfield readies 
IPFW police force 



By ROBERT RINEARSON 

Editor's Note: Reporter Robert 
Rinearson recently toured the police 
training facilities of the Indiana Law 
Enforcement Academy at Plainfield 
where IPFW's campus police are 
trained. His account of that visit 
follows. 

"In order to insure the public safety 
and general welfare of the people of the 
state of Indiana and to promote equity 
for all segments of society." This is the 
opening sentence of the statute ex- 
plaining the responsibility of the 
Indiana Law Enforcement Academy. 

Colonel Arthur Raney, executive 
director of the academy, further ex- 
plained the philosophy behind the in- 
stitution. "We seek to make the 
policeman on the street a professional, 
in order to give the residents of Indiana 
the best protection available," he said. 

For the past 11 years, the Academy 
has graduated officers for nearly every 
segment of Indiana law enforcement, 
including county sheriff's departments, 
state, city and university police 
departments. 

Raney also said state law requires 
every law enforcement officer to 
successfully complete the course within 
a year of his or her employment or lose 
his power of arrest. 

The basic course at the academy 
lasts 10 weeks and includes first aid, 
firemen's components training, law 
components training and a core 
curriculum that consists of various law 
enforcement subjects. 

Each student must attain at least a 70 
percent average in each area of 
training to successfully complete the 
course and receive subsequent cer- 
tification as a law enforcement officer. 

A student who falls may, with ap- 



proval of the executive director, return 
to the academy for further training. 

After completing the initial training, 
any officer may return for in-service or 
specialized training for periods of one- 
to-three weeks. Special courses offered 
in these sessions include civil disorders 
control, criminal law, laboratory 
procedures, advanced firearms 
training, photography, finger printing, 
scuba training and science technology. 

Captain Frank Roberts, director of 
training at the academy! emphasized 
that most officers now continue their 
education after basic training to better 
prepare themselves for their jobs. 

"It's a different world now, mostly 
because of the laws passed during the 
'60s and '70s," Roberts said. "Twenty- 
five years ago you didn't have Miranda 
or Mapp vs. Ohio. An officer just 
doesn't make an arrest and forget 
about it now. He must provide the 
evidence clear through to conviction." 

A trainee's day at the academy 
begins at 6 a.m. with calisthenics and 
physical training. The cadets are then 
either in class or on the firing range 
from 8a.m. to 5 p.m. 

"The police officer these days has to 
be almost a special breed," Roberts 
explained of the strenuous training. 
"He or she must be both physically and 
mentally ready to deal with some of the 
most unimaginable predicaments.' 

Roberts emphasized the importance 
of the role of the Academy in training 
today's law enforcement officers. 

"A police officer, regardless if he is a 
state trooper or a campus policeman, 
must not forget any part of his training 
in any field," he said. "He is expected 
to uphold the law in any given 
situation."

IPFW, city join 
to solve problems 



By DENNIS KITE 

The city of Fort Wayne and IPFW 
are banding together to fight urban 
problems through a vehicle called 
the Urban Observatory. 

The purpose for the institution (a 
research and analytic task force of 
IPFW faculty members) is "to bring 
the university's research and 
technical skills to bear on urban 
problems," said James C. Owen, 
assistant professor of public and 
environmental affairs and executive 
secretary of the Observatory. 

They way it works is the city 
presents the Observatory with- a 
description of a particular program 
or project they are having trouble 
with, Owen said, and the Obser- 
vatory identifies the university 
personnel that can respond to the 
city's need. 

The Observatory concept was first 
suggested nationally in 1962 in a 
paper by Robert C. Wood entitled 
"The Contribution of Political 
Science to Urban Form." 

IPFW has been involved with the 
idea for three years. In that time, 
they have done research for a civil 
defense base map (a map of heavily 
populated areas). 

"Fort Wayne did not have an 
adequate civil defense warning 
system," Owen explained. The 
Observatory was called in to develop 
such a system. 

In January 1980, the Observatory 
conducted workshops where a 
growth management system (an 
urban service area! was presented 
to city planners and officials. 

Currently, the Observatory is 



working on a description and 
analysis of local tax resources. 

Presently, there are 12 IPFW 
faculty members involved. Included 
are members of the board of the 
Observatory: Roy W. Shin, division 
chairman of public and en- 
vironmental affairs and chairman of 
the board; Michael C. Downs, 
chairperson and associate professor 
of political science; and Owen. 

The city's members of the board 
consist of Karl Bandemer, urban 
grants director; Abraham Farkas, 
community development and 
planning director; and Patricia 
Sheldon, urban affairs coordinator. 

Owen is more than confident in the 
future of the Observatory. "We 
expect it to be a year of growth," he 
said. "At this point, it has become 
firmly established with the city. " 

Owen sees the Observatory as "a 
remarkable capability that has not 
been fully capitalized on." 

Winfield Moses Jr., mayor of Fort 
Wayne, sees the Observatory as a 
chance for the city and IPFW to 
work together for a common goal. 

"I think it's an excellent com- 
bination of city government and 
education," the Mayor said. 

Mayor Moses pointed out that 
when he first entered government, 
he lacked personal experience with 
the problems that confronted him. 
But, with the establishment of the 
Observatory, students and faculty 
now have a chance to gain the 
practical experience needed to 
confront the "unique experience of 
city government." 



RUSH: Greeks welcome fall pledges 

Sigs Eps host smoker 




By JEFF ELLIOTT 

and JIM CHAPMAN 

As the song goes, "Sig Eps Are We." 
So sang the brothers of Sigma Phi 
Epsilon during their recent com- 
bination Smoker and Rush party. 

The brothers brought the meaning of 
this song to life as they shared it with 
the fraternal inductees. 

"We're the only social fraternity on 
campus," said Gregg Weisman, one of 
the fraternity leaders. 

The only other "Frat" on campus is 
Delta Sigma Pi, a brotherhood for 
business-oriented students. 

The Sig Eps held the gathering to 
interest pledges. 



Sigma Phi Epsilon usually sponsors 
the Halloween Dance and is currently 
discussing plans with SUBOG to 
sponsor the dance this year. They also 
raise money for the blind and for the 
heart fund. 

At the Smoker, the inductees viewed 
a film strip showing a variety of 
fraternal activities. The filmstrip was 
accompanied by songs such as Earth, 
Wind and Fire's "Fantasy" and Carly 
Simon's "The Spy Who Loved Me." 

"The fraternity is a positive force on 
campus," said Jim Fairfield, who calls 
himself the founding father. 

The Sig Ep office is in Suite 221 of the 
Walb Memorial Union building.

By LINDA HARTMAN 
The first step to becoming members 
of IPFW's two social organizations that 
promote friendships and sisterhood was 
taken Saturday night by nearly 50 
students. 

Delta Gamma Fraternity (for 
women) and Pi Beta Phi Sorority met 
interested women with their songs at 
separate rush meetings, served 
refreshments, and showed pictures of 
the past year's events. 

Eve Cochlin, president of Pi Beta Phi, 
said that sororities "give those who feel 
they have no ties at home a sense of 
home. It is an opportunity to meet lots 
of friends and it looks good on a job 
resume." The only drawbacks she sees 



are the stereotyping of members and 
the costs. 

Sue Mueller, vice president of 
chapter relations of Delta Gamma, 
said, "There are many more ad- 
vantages than disadvantages. It is a 
great way of meeting people and get- 
ting involved in school. It also give you 
an opportunity to build your leadership 
skills," 

Both of these campus social groups 
are involved with area philanthropic 
causes and sponsor fund-raising events 
throughout the year. 

On Sunday, the second round of rush 
parties will be held from 5:30 to 7 p.m. 
in Ihe first floor lounge of the Walb 
Memorial Union.

Why study languages? 



The problem of rape 



When it comes to the problems of 
women, blaming the victim is a popular 
sport. No where is this more evident 
than with the problem of rape. 

Women are told their actions invite 
rape, even when they are in their own 
homes. The very act of being female 
seems to be all that is required to issue 
Ihis "invitation." 

Because society assumes the victim to 
be at fault, the offense becomes trivial 
and less important. Police then tend not 
to pursue the perpetrators as vigorously, 
prosecutors are less likely to prosecute, 
and judges and juries admonish and 
punish the raped instead of the rapist. 

Something is radically wrong when the 
victim becomes the accused Do we ask 
victims with stolen wallets or snatched 
purses how they were dressed? Do we 
ask the victims of assault and battery if 
they enjoyed it? Do we tell kidnap vic- 
tims that they somehow asked for it? 



Bus fumes 
and salads 



No. We manage to see the loss, the 
pain and the anguish in these crimes. 

Rape damages the minds and bodies of 
women. Rape hurts. Rape violates and 
robs. Rape is an ugly crime committed 
by men and not the female victims. And 
rape is an ugly crime whether the 
female victims are prostitutes or four- 
month-old children. 

Until society discards the myths of 
rape and recognizes its brutal truth, we 
will continue to have judges who believe 
women "troll" for rape. We will continue 
to have police officers who believe that a 
woman's attire, even at home, asks for 
rape. 

Perhaps we should adopt the long, 
black, heavily-veiled look of the women 
in the Arab world. There, at least, 
women know exactly where they stand. 
Here, we have only the illusion of 
freedom and the cruel, confining reality 
of rape.

CHAIRPERSON OF 

DEPARTMENTOF 

MODERN FOREIGN 

LANGUAGES 

The demise of foreign 

languages Is pari of a larger 

assault on literacy, part of a 

larger decline in the 

capacity lo handle language 

stall. 

A.BariletlGiamatil 
Bartlett Giamatti, scholar - 
leacher at Yale University. 
uses tough, blunt words to 
address a question which 
many of us would prefer to 
leave unasked: What un- 
derlies our deplorable lack 
of inleresl in letters'* And he 
speaks with out equivocation. 
Amid the pressures to find 
employment, to remain 
"current" in our fields, to 
succeed at least to the extent 
(hat an income is assured, 
we are losing the sense of 
what it is to be educated 
persons. What once was 



understood in the phrase 
"cogito ergo sum" would 
now have lo be redefined to 
express current ex- 
pectations: I am what my 
work makes me. 

For the goal is no longer to 
become a literate person, to 
attain some magnificence of 
mind; rather, the goal is lo 
obtain gainful employment. 

Jane Fonda, like Giamatti 
an astute student of 
American life, cautions 
against acquiescing to such 
pressures: ". . . you become 
what you do, and if you only 
do what you're slotted into — 
and what you're slotted into 
is teeny-weeny compared to 
what your heart and soul and 
mind are capable of — then 
your heart and soul and 
mind begin to shrivel up." 

Surely we know that no 
more terrible demise con- 
fronts us, citizens of the 
dawning new century, than 
that we allow our essential 
humanity to be subsumed 



under the jobs for which we 
train with such vehemence. 
Employment and produc- 
tivity are important; they 
are, however, not the goal. 

The goal of higher 
education, indeed of all 
education, is to develop an 
attitude toward life which 
allows one to distinguish the 
quality of events from their 
mere quantity. At the same 
time, we seek to learn 
specific skills which sharpen 
the wit and make us flexible 
and able to adjust to new 
circumstances. This 
lifetime enterprise extends 
beyond the classroom and 
the job to touch all aspects of 
being. 

We are indeed what we 
think, and what we think is 
expressed through language. 
Learning to express oneself 
in English, French, German, 
Russian, Spanish, Mandarin 
Chinese, Persian or Hindi, is 
to take a step toward freeing 
oneself of one's tendency to 




I-P 

GUEST 
COLUMN 



prejudge persons and events 
based upon one's own limited 
frameofexperience. 

The magnificence of our 
species is not contained by 
one mold of physique, of 
national origin, of race, of 
belief and practice. Our 
small, rather colorful, planet 
is peopled by a number of 
tribes, some primitive, some 
not quite so primitive, whose 
variety of language and 
thought we should celebrate. 

For the magnificence of 
our species is contained in 
the often fragile vessel of our 
ability to think and to speak, 



to comprehend abstract 
concepts and to com- 
municate them to one 
another. To learn to com- 
municate in another per- 
son's language is not only to 
affirm that person, but also 
to affirm an essential quality 
of life on earth. 

Our human ability to think 
and to communicate has 
allowed us to anticipate 
change, to prepare for it, and 
to survive. Our languages 
provide the medium for such 
thought and communication. 
In nurturing their study, we 
nurture our future. 



tick him off 

By CLAY 
HOUSHOLDER 

A couple of things really 
tick me off. Like exhaust 
fumes from the tailpipes of 
buses. 

If you get too close lo the 
rear of a bus, you are bound 
to be gagged. The exhaust is 
emitted so that the fumes 
rise from about kneee level 
and then cause great 
discomfort to the nose and 
mouth, 

I called the bus company 
to ask about the new buses 
they would soon be getting. I 
wanted to know what sort of 
exhaust system the new 
buses would have. 

They informed me the 
federal government requires 
exhaust systems on new 
buses to be just like the old

systems. In other words, we 
will continue to be gagged by 
the fumes from buses. 

It's the fed's fault and that 
really ticks me off. 

Another thing thai bothers 
me is pizza places that have 
salad bars. 

Whenever you go into 
these places to relax and eat 
a pizza, the person who takes 
your order will undoubtedly 
ask, "Do you want salad bar 
with that?" 

Now, if I wanted lo have 
salad. I could have asked. 
It'snol that difficult 



I understand the waiters 
and waitresses are trained to 
ask that question, but it 
would be nice if you could 
just go in and eat your pizza 
without hearing, "Do you 
want salad bar with thai?" 

But I have come up with 
my own solution. Whenever 
I go into a pizza place, I just 
order salad and a glass of 
water. 

Now I'm waiting for them 
to ask me, "Do you want 
pizza with that?" If they do, 
I'll really be ticked off. 



To the Editor: 

Your Sept. 4 editorial 
focused on the shortage of 
parking on campus during 
peak hours. It is true that 
future expansion of the 
university will make parking 
even more difficult, but only 
if expansion brings more 
cars. 

Continuing escalation in 
the price of gasoline will 
make it more attractive for 
students to use public 
transportation. 

The university is well 
served by several buses now 
— and there is much that you 
can do to ensure that buses 
are more widely used in the 
future. 

I'm certain many of your 
readers would appreciate 
knowing how the bus system 
works and how to find the 
Bursar's office where the 
weekly passes are sold. 

With the construction of 



the two new buildings, the 
focus of campus activities 
will move to the north. It 
would greatly promote 
ridership if a shelter were 
constructed between the 
Helmke Library and the 
Walb Memorial Union and 
the buses used the semi- 
circular drive in that area as 
the place where they paused 
before resuming their 
schedules. 

The Students' Government 
might consider consulting 
with the bus company to 
devise schedules which 
would better serve the needs 
of the students. 

In the past, a program 
matching car pool riders 
existed. Is such a program 
still in existence? You could 
perhaps push for preferred

To the Editor: 

I am concerned about the 
quality of art criticism, not 
only in The Communicator, 
but in many publications. 
Movie critics in particular 
often seem to approach art 
with a closed mind. Art can 
only stimulate what the 
beholder brings to the ex- 
perience — his knowledge, 
emotions and aesthetic 
appreciation. 

Turning now to the review 
of "Xanadu" by Mike 
Geffen, I should like to make 
a few comments. Geffen 
undoubtedly missed ail the 



riches the movie had to 
offer. The film is intended to 
be a fantasy, a trip, a dream. 
Its colors, shapes and 
movement vividly expressed 
the spirit of fantasy. Its 
major theme is "the dream 
come alive." 

The question it poses is, 
"can the great artist, the 
muse, bring her {or his) 
ideas to bear fruit in 
reality?" The question is not 
answered, but "Xanadu" 
certainly inspires the 
creative person to remain 
hopeful.

At First Presbyterian 

'Ghosts 9 significant drama 



By STEVE RIEGEL 

In an effort to improve the 
quality and range of theatre 
offerings in Fort Wayne, The 
First Presbyterian Theater 
has endeavored to open its 
season with a significant 
drama, Henrik Ibsen's 
"Ghosts." 

Through the efforts of 
director John Tolley. they 
have succeeded in producing 
a moving show that is not 
only a maslerwork of 
literature, but is relevant to 
our own time as well. 

When it first opened near 
the end of the 19th Century, 
"Ghosts" was theatrically 
revolutionary. It was among 
the first plays to be written 
in ordinary, rather than 
poetic, language. It was also 
revolutionary because it was 
a psychological drama that 
did not rely on sensational 
action to keep the audience's 
attention. 

"Ghosts" was con- 
troversial partly because it 
dealt with such matters as 
adultery, venereal disease 
and incest. 

But even more con- 
troversial was the image of 
society the play reflected. 
Ibsen pictured people's lives 
as a product of, and often 
controlled by, "ghosts." 

As Mrs. Alving puts it in 
Act n, "It's not only what we 
inherit from our fathers and 
mothers that keeps on 
returning in us. It's all kinds 



or old dead doctrines and 
opinions and beliefs, that 
sort of thing." 

The ghosts come from both 
inside and out. One ghost has 
to do with the influence of the 
past on the present; "the 
sins of the fathers are visited 
upon the children." Another 
involves abstract ideals such 
as religions or societal 
systems. 

The ghosts are effective 
because of people's un- 
willingness to be honest with 
themselves and live as they 
believe. Instead, they are 
content to let public opinion 
and "duty" be their guides. 
The problem is further 
complicated by a failure of 
communication between 
individuals. 

These tensions are em- 
bodied in the characters. 
Dana N. Charette was 
perfectly cast as Pastor 
Manders. Though he 
represents the most 
potentially evil force in the 
play, he is not consciously 
evil. Rather, he seems in- 
nocent to the implications of 
his behavior. He does not lie 
maliciously, but because, for 
him, the truth has become 
secondary to the ideal. 

The opposite tendency, the 
search for truth, is 
represented in the play by 
Osvald, played somewhat 
melodramatically on 
opening night by Dee 
Russell. He is joined in the 



Music and fun 
at Cars show 



By CLAY 

HOUSHOLDER 

Rock fans who attended 
the concert at the Memorial 
Coliseum last Friday 
evening were treated to a 
slightly short but not un- 
satisfying performance by 
the Cars and the Motels. 

The Motels' set began at 
about B:05, only five minutes 
behind scheduled curtain 
time. Throughout their 
segment of the show, "the 
Motels swept in and out of 
varying musical styles 
quickly and smoothly. On a 
few occasions, many patrons 
were caught a bit off guard 
by some of the changes in the 
sound. 

For instance, a couple of 
times, Marty Jouarad. an 
exciting and theatrical 
keyboard man, would begin 
what appeared to be an 
organ solo. The crowd then 
would glance in his general 
direction to witness a hot 
saxophone solo instead. 

The solid bass and drum 
work by Michael Goodroe 
and Brian Glascock, 
respectively, gave the 
Motels a firm base for in- 
tricate and strange guitar, 
keyboard, and saxophone 
melodies. 

The Motels' sound, at 
times, verges on jazz and at 
other times rocks with hard 
lines. 

All things considered, the 
Motels were a fine choice for 
priming the audience for the 
Cars. 

After an intermission to 
prepare the stage for the 
second act, the Cars came on 
one-by-one. First was 
Gregory Hawkes, who set his 
keyboard console into some 
synthesized percussion. 
Then came David Robinson 
taking his place on the 
drumkit. The remainder of 
the band followed, adding 



their guitars to the overall 
scene. 

The Cars did well in 
blending their older, more 
popular tunes like "Let's 
Go," "Good Times Roll," 
"My Best Friend's Girl," to 
name a few, with some songs 
from their recently released 
"Panorama" album. 

This mixing of well per- 
formed songs kept the 
audience both interested and 
abitoff balance. 

One tune, "Moving in 
Stereo," seemed to be very 
well done. All of the in- 
strumentation was tight, and 
the vocals by Benjamin Orr 
made this one stand out as 
one of the better numbers of 
the night. 

Mention should be made of 
the stage itself. The stage 
was made mostly of 
aluminum with a flat black 
bi-level platform. Vents in 
the floor of the higher level 
of the stage allowed lights to 
blacklight the front part of 
the stage. Drops behind the 
stage changed once in a 
while to allow different 
geometric patterns of light 
to stand behind the playing 
area. All-in-all, the stage 
was, in a word, neat. 

As a whole, the Cars ap- 
pear to be a tight ship. Eliot 
Easton stands out as a solid 
force in the band on lead 
guitars. Ric Ocasek also 
plays some fine guitar and 
had fun throwing picks into 
the crowd. He also enjoyed a 
bit of interplay with the folks 
pressed against the fence. 

The Cars are a good band 
in concert. They are exciting 
and "elaborate. They have a 
good mix. They also have fun 
with the music they play. Ric 
Ocasek told me after the 
show that he would play his 
whole set to an empty arena. 
It seems that the Cars as a 
band are dedicated to music 
and fun.

search by Mrs. Alving 
(Ladonna Huntley) and 
Regina (Molly Hagan). 

At the end of the play, they 
are all faced with the truth 
about themselves. For 
Osvald and Regina, it means 
freedom, but Mrs. Alving 
ultimately fails to overcome 
her ghosts. 

The character most in 
control of his own life is 
Engstrand, given a comic 
touch by Jerry Egger. He 



has a clear enough view of 
the ghosts that he can take 
advantage of the blindness of 
people like Manders. 

Tolley did an excellent job 
of maintaining the integrity 
of the play. His direction 
kept the production from 
lapsing into melodrama 
while effectively portraying 
the emotional passions of the 
characters. This show is well 
worth seeing for anyone with 
an interest in theatre. 



Lissim display 
at art museum 



ByNICKSTANGER 

"The World of Simon 
Lissim — 90 Designs for the 
Theater" is currently on 
display through Sept. 28 at 
the Fort Wayne Museum of 
Art. 

The unusual paintings 
cover 55 years of stage and 
costume design by this 
Russian artist whose folk 
culture is extremely evident 
in the clothing and set 
designs. 

The first thing one notices 
in viewing these paintings is 
the beauty of the designs and 
the boldness of the colors. 

By contrast, however, the 
faces of the people seem to 
be drawn in a very plain, 
simple, childlike manner, 
perhaps to demonstrate that 
the faces were less im- 
portant than the costuming. 

An unusual and 

disorientating feature about 
these paintings is their lack 
of depth or perspective, 
because there seems to be no 
light source or shadow. 

However, these aspects 
are not required, either, 
since the main purpose was 
to show constume designs in 
the colors and shapes they 
were to be made of — not 
how they actually appeared 
in real life. 

This requirement con- 
tradicts one of the basic laws 
most artists use: that is, an 
object is painted as it is seen, 
rather than the color of the 
object and its real shape. 

In other words, just 
because grass is green, a 
distant hillside need not be 



painted green if it really 
looks blue or grey. Because 
the paintings in question lack 
this basis, although it is not a 
flaw by any means, it is 
peculiar, and gives them the 
look that a child painted 
them. 

Lissim was born in Kiev in 
1900, and at age 21, 
emigrated to Paris with his 
family. In Paris, Lissim 
found inspiration in French 
impressionist painting, 
although it doesn't appear 
that the style influenced his 
own work. 

He received his first 
commission, in 1923, to 
create designs for the 
Theatre de 1'Oeuvre in Paris 
and went on to design for the 
Ballet Russe de Basil, the 
Theatre National de l'Opera 
Comique, the Gran Teatro 
del Liceo and others. 

Following World War II, 
Lissim took up permanent 
residence in the United 
States, and in 1944, joined the 
faculty of the City College of 
New York until 1971. 

The exhibit is drawn from 
public and private collectors 
and includes watercolors, 
drawings, costume sketches 
and set designs. Included are 
works from the 1924 
production of "The Legend 
of Tsar Saltan" and the 1931 
produttioiTof "The Love for 
'Three Oranges." 

The paintings are very 
interesting and some of the 
costume sketches are quite 
detailed and beautiful. The 
display is well worth the 
time to see.

Championship repeat sought 

V-ball coach optimistic 



By CHRIS PYLE 

"We have (he potential and 
skill to be state champs this 
year loo!" said women's 
volleyball coach Peggy 
Voisin, when asked to assess 
this year's team. 

Those remarks were in 
reference to the 1979 IPFW 
women's volleyball team, 
which finished with a 28-14 
season record and won the 
Indiana stale championship 
in the NCAA Division III 
playoffs. 

Back from las! season's 
championship squad are co- 
captains Kim Heimann and 
Jo WHte, Mary Drake, Beth 
Christman, and Julie Gray. 

To round out the squad, 
Voisin has first year players 
Lorl Gray, Nancv Rorick, 



Sue Hendricks, Linda 
Przeniczny and Peggy Link 
as manager. 

With only nine members 
currently out for the squad, 
Voisin would like to get more 
girls coming out for the 
learn. "Anyone of any age is 
encouraged to try out," 
Voisin said. "The only 
stipulation is the student 
must carry 12 hours and take 
a physical." 

"There are too many part- 
time students," Voisin said. 
"Many students have jobs as 
well. Once we can offer 
scholarships that will help 
pay for tuition, more people 
will be eager to participate." 

The girls who are out for 
the team are eager to play. 
They spent a vigorous 



summer in a training 
program getting into con- 
dition. "We were required to 
run distances, lift weights, 
and exercise every day," co- 
captain Heimann said of the 
summer program. 

Looking ahead, Voisin felt 
the highlights of the season 
will be the Kentucky 
Invitational and the state 
tourney. 

"We look at the Kentucky 
Invitational as a learning 
experience, as we will be 
playing some of the best 
teams in the U.S.," the coach 
commented. "You have to 
play good teams to get 
better." 

The 1980 edition of the 
IPFW women's volleyball 
team will make their debut 



on Sept. 22. They will travel 
to Grace College to play 
Grace and St. Mary's 
College. 

On Tuesday, Sept. 23, the 
Tuskers will participate in 



the city tournament with 
Bible, Indiana Tech, and St. 
Francis colleges. The 
tourney will be held at the 
Concordia gym and starts at 
5p.m. 



Tuskers find win 
in soccer opener 



By JIM CHAPMAN 

Three second-half Tusker 
goals enabled the IPFW 
soccer team to come home 
from Bluff ton College of Ohio 
with a 3-0 victory, their first 
win in as many starts. 

Tom Johnson led the 
Tusker scoring as he notched 
the first two of the three 
scores. Chris Warr added the 
third to insure the victory. 

The Tuskers struggled 
throughout the first half and 
could not get their operation 
running smoothly until the 
final period. 

"We played poorly in the 
first half," coach Ed 
Stefankiewicz said later. 
"They took it to us." 

The Tuskers' disorganized 
play in the first period 
resulted in missing several 
key opportunities to post 



points on the board, 

Johnson drew first blood in 
the second half as he poked 
home a cross from Warr with 
a header into the net. 
Johnson's second goal came 
on a penalty kick. 

Fullback Warr scored his 
goal unassisted as he bent a 
corner kick around the post 
and into the Bluffton goal. 

Stefankiewicz praised 
Warr and goalie Dennis 
Knuth, who had 14 saves, for 
their excellent play. He also 
credited freshman wing 
fullback Mark Gabrek for 
stabilizing the defense on the 
left side and Dave Husar for 
steadying the offensive 
attack. 

The Tuskers were to have 
played St. Joseph College at 
Rensselaer on Tuesday, The 
results of that game were 



unavailable at presstime. 

This week, the Tuskers 
have been tuning up for 
Saturday's game with Spring 
Arbor College, probably the 
toughest opponent they will 
face this season. Spring 
Arbor was ranked eighth in 
NAIA competition last year. 

Though James Hen- 
mueller and Dan Verstynen 
were both forced to the 
sidelines with injuries in the 
Bluffton game, 

Stefankiewicz hopes they 
will be healthy and able to 
play in the Spring Arbor 
game. 

The Tuskers host Spring 
Arbor College on the IPFW 
athletic field this Saturday. 
Game time is 1:00 p.m. 

On Sept. 25, the Tuskers 
will meet Concordia College 
at 4:00 p.m. on the Concordia 
field.

during both his junior and 
senior years. 

Tusker coach Ken Work- 
man is encouraged by the 
signing of the players. 
"These three young people 
will complement our 



returning players 
well," Workman said.

'They 

have excellent game savvy 
and can contribute

Workman concluded.

The IPFW women's tennis 
team lost to Huntington, 7-2, 
in their match held at 
Wildwood Racquet Club last 
Saturday. 

The match, originally 
scheduled to be played at 
IPFW, was cancelled due to 
rain and moved to Wildwood 
by permission of Dean 
Ulmer. 

One of the major factors of 
the loss, according to Coach 
Ben Becker, is that Dede 
Rippetoe, one of the team's 
better players, was out with 
classes. Becker confirms, "I 
don't approve of anyone 
cutting classes to play." 
Another team member, 
Cheryl Bundy, was also not 
present Saturday. He feels 
these losses were a definite 
handicap for the team. 

Becker is, however, 
delighted in the group's 
improvement in playing 



together as a team. He is 
also very pleased with the 
performance of Mary Lou 
Pease "whose improvement 
can be seen to increase 
every day." She won her 
match, 6-1, 6-0, as did the 
doubles pair of Cindy Riser 
and Carey Shifferly, 7-6 and 
6-2. 

The next scheduled match 
is with St. Joseph's College,
