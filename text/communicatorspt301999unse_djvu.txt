Bomb threats disrupt classes again; 
$5,000 reward offered for conviction 



by Katfiy Delagrange. 
News Editor 



As of Sept. 28. IPFW has 
received throe bomb threats 
during the fall semester. 
Bomb threats were received 
on Sept. 16 in Kettlcr Hall, on 
Sept. 20 at the Science 
Building and In Neff Hall on 
Sept. 27. 

Although all reports of 
bombs were false, each build- 



ing had to be evacuated until 
fully Inspected by campus 
police. All bomb threats must 
be taken seriously on the 
chance that a bomb may have 
been planted on the designat- 
ed site. 

According to Chief 
Lauren Denhartog of IPFW 
Police and Safety-, depending 
on the building, it takes 
approximately thirty minutes 
to one hour to search all 
rooms. This causes classes, 
meetings and operations to 
cease until the building is 



The last bloom 
of summer 




"When a bomb threat Is 
received, the fire alarm will 

pants of the need to evacuate 
the premises. Students should 
immediately exit and remain 
a few hundred feet away from 
the building. Wc then post 
the time the building will 
reopen," said Denhartog. 

Many students linger 
outside the affected building, 
chatting with fellow students. 
However, this Is not a safe 
practice because if a bomb 
were detonated, 
onlookers could 
potentially be 
injured by fly- 
ing debris. 

According to 
Denhartog, 



are class D 
felonies which 
remain on one's 
record indefl- 

caught and con- 
victed of calling 
in bomb threats 
could be put In 
prison for up to 
one and a hair 
years and be 
fined up to 
S10.000. 

In 1997 and 
1998, two peo- 
ple were caught 
making bomb 
threats, one of

bomb threats,* said 
Denhartog. "We all need to 
work together to resolve this 
problem." 

IPFW student Frank 
Swlnford said. -I think as 
administrators, they have to 
take them (bomb threats) 

being wasted away from 
classes for both the teachers 
and the students. You know

Lenore DeFonso, assis-

said, 'I'm a faculty member 
and I find these very, very 
disturbing. They really dis- 
rupt things; they wreak havoc 
with our schedule. I'd like to 
think that there's no chance 
that it's a real bomb and I'm 
always tempted to stay in my 
omce, but these days, I'm not 
sure that that's true anymore. 
There have been some pretty 
scary things going on with 
bombings and shootings."

Phi Beta Kappa presents Lawrence Lipking 



by Meivi/i P. Cormican n 
Staff Writer 



On Tuesday, Sept. 28, the 
Eastern Indiana Association of Phi 
Beta Kappa welcomed Lawrence 
Lipking, a Chester D. Tripp Professor 
of Humanities at Northwestern 
University, for his lecture "Civilizing 
the Universe: Imagination and the 
Scientific Revolution." Upklng enter- 
tained and educated an audience of 
students, faculty and alumni of Phi 
Beta Kappa with his light, conversa- 
tional oration on parity between the 



arts and sciences in the 17th and 
18th centuries. 

"The abundant plurality of 
worlds, the marvel of looking 
through the telescope and the micro- 
scope and seeing and Imagining 
other kinds of life: This for me is the 
most valuable lesson of the 
Enlightenment and one that needs in 
be renewed," said Lipking. 

Upklng, a prolific author, recipi- 
ent of the MLA Riley Parker Prize and 
founder of NWU's Comparative 
Literature program, is on leave this 
year as a fellow of the Kaplan Center 
for the Humanities. 



The lecture, a product of a new 
program of community- based activi- 
ties by Phi Beta Kappa, was coordi- 
nated by Elaine Blakemore, chair of 
psychology, and James Pyle, presi- 
dent of the Eastern Indiana 
Association of Phi Beta Kappa. 

"As. the Association begins to 
grow, we hope that It will not only be 
a part of the life of this campus and 
other campuses, but that it will reach 
out to other areas," said Pyle. 

For those who were unable to 
attend, the lecture will air on College 
56 at a future time.

According to Chief Lauren Dcnhartog 
of Police and Safety, there have been 31 
bomb threats since the fall or 1997. No 
bombs have been found during 
Denhartog's 23 years of service. Every time 
there is a bomb threat, a class Is disrupted 
or canceled and olTlcers from Police and 
Safety have to spend an hour checking the 
building. The time of students, professors 
and police officers Is wasted. 

To the person or persons calling In the 
bomb threats, wo ask, who do you think 
you are? Who are you to terrorize and dis- 
rupt the IPFW community! What gives you 
the right to Interrupt the lives of thou- 
sands of people! This Is not a Joke. We 
have spoken with the administration and 
they take these bomb threats seriously. 

Did you know, dear bomb threat 
caller(s), that you are committing a class D 
felony? You could be put in prison ror a 
year and a half and pay up to S10.000 in 
lines. According to Dcnhartog. two people 
were caught two years ago for making 
bomb threats at IPFW. One person was a 
student. 

A class D felony will never come off 
your record, ir the callerjs) Is a student, we 
suggest that you think twice before making 
another raise call. IPFW is offering a S5.000 
reward to anyone with Information that 
could lead to the capture of the bomb 
threat calter(s). We encourage the student 
body to call Police and Safety at 481-6827 
or 481-6911 If they have any information. 

As we mentioned earlier, the bomb 
threat caller(s) disrupt a whole communi- 
ty. First of all, some people drive 45 min- 
utes to an hour to get to IPFW. This group 
includes students, professors, faculty, staff 
and visitors. Think of how many people 
are In a building at one dme. There are 
students and professors In classes, secre- 
taries In the offices of the different depart- 
ments, maintenance people cleaning or 
repairing the building and people who hanJ 




could be conducting n 



utlngs o 



difficulties with visitors could arise, too. 
Although no bombs have been found, the 
visitors of IPFW don't know that. Who 
wants to go to a campus that Is constantly 
harassed by the threat of bombs? If we 
were not familiar with IPFW and its "bomb 
problems," we would not want to come 
here. Who wants to go be at a place where 
life Is threatened? Not us. 

If, bomb threat caller(s), you ire a stu- 
dent, shame on you. The students of IPFW 
have goals and dreams. They work very

dear caller(s). IPFW Is the 
largest university In Fort Wayne. You are 
threatening the lives of many or the mem- 
bers of your community and giving IPFW a 
bad reputation. IPFW has enough problems 
as It is without bomb threats. How does 
this campus look to people outside the 
community? 

Shame on those responsible for bomb 
threat calls. Don't you have any pride? 
Callers have been caught in the past. Don't 
think that no one Is Investigating the 
threats. According to Denhartog, an Inves- 
tigation Is In process. We hope, dear 
caller(s) that you are caught. We expect an 
apology and a harsh punishment for what

The Promise

:d siaH members 

re short-tempered, 

igh and generally Incon- 

Iderate of those they cared 

myself that I would leave 
the medical profession if I 
ever succumbed to that 

A few weeks after I 
started working as a certi- 
fied nursing aide (CNA), I began to notice that many of 
the more experienced aides seemed to be In more of a 
hurry to bathe, dress and care for the residents assigned 
to them than the newer aides were. I attributed this to 
the effect that working with too little help ror too long 
can have on a person. 

As most people are aware, medical personnel are In 
great demand whether one Is a registered nurse, licensed 
practical nurse or CNA. This shortage is particularly evi- 
dent in nursing homes and other extended care facilities. 
One cannot escape the fact that an ever-Increasing pro- 
portion of the population Is being termed "older adult" 
because people are living longer. 

It's absolutely wonderful that modern medicine can 
support a person through a variety of Illnesses and dis- 
ease processes. Unfortunately, Iherc simply are not 
enough trained caregivers to provide assistance to these 
people. Nurses and technicians become "burned out" 
from having to compensate for a tack of staff by being 
required to do the Jobs of two or three people. 

Unfair? Definitely. Unsafe? Possibly. As I stated earli- 
er, through my experiences as a CNA, I observe many 
aides falling Into the role oT the rushed and hurried 
healthcare provider as they continued to work at the 
facility. In fact, as the number of staff member, on my 
shift dwindled, I began to feel frustrated on occasion. 

How was I supposed to provide the level of care that 
these people deserved when we often worked at only 
three fourths or half staff? It became Increasingly diffi- 
cult to accomplish the basic, required tasks of the shift, 
much less to do the little extras such as a late night chat 
to comfort someone or massaging the pain out of a resi- 
dent's arthritic Joints. 

I finally resigned from this Job when I felt that I 
could no longer control the quality of care 1 provided. 
Those people whom I had truly come not only to care for, 
but also to care about, were no longer receiving 100 per- 
cent of my attention due to the staffing situation. I was 
no longer able to provide the quality care that they need- 
ed and deserved. Remembering my resolution to leave if 1 
ever felt forced to lower my standards of care, I turned In 
my resignation. 

I realize that nursing personnel are In demand In 
nearly every' facility In the area. One needs only to look 
at the help wanted ads In the newspaper to realize that 
most establishments are all but begging for help. Many 
Individuals who meet the minimum qualifications are 
receiving on the Job training to perform the more special- 
ized roles which are so lacking for staff. 

Knowing this situation and acknowledging that 1 will 
most likely work short-staffed the majority of my work- 
ing days (and there will be many!). I am, amazingly- 
enough, still pursuing a career in nursing. Why? Because 
I truly enjoy caring for other people. In my current Job, I 
witness the miracle of life every time 1 work. 

Helping bring new lives into the world and Into r heir 
parents' arms is an honor that I feel privileged to have. If 
I ever should reach the point where my career feels like a 
burden or If I would ever become bitter about my Job, I 
have promised myseir that I will leave. 



Through the Grapevine 
Dorms bring IPFW 'life'? 

by Andrew Welch, Staff Columnist 

Togetherness. 

This Is something our campus has tacked Tor quite 
some time. We hear people constantly complaining that 
students do not attend activities. 

But will new dorms make a difference? 

Personally, while I think It would be a great experi- 
ence to live In a dorm, I feel strongly that the extracurric- 
ular events for students will not get much more support 
than they arc getting now. 

Why? 

Well, 1, fer one, attend IPFW because It Is a com- 
muter campus. 1 have other commitments besides 
school-like Jobs. Other than work, I am Involved In my 
own activities outside or school. 

Most people who go "away" to college have the time 
to go to campus events. They have the time to do these 
things because they have left the rest of their lives at 
home for the duration or the school year. 

It may not seem this way, but I am in favor o( the 
new dorms on campus-even though I find it crazy that I 
will have to walk through a tunnel under S.R. 37 to get to 
campus from the dorms. 

I see the dorms as a way to experience whal going 
"away* to college would really be like. However, this will 
not Inspire me so much as to quit my Jobs and other 
activities Just so I can attend extracurricular activities 
that I didn't have time Tor before. 

But, given thai 1 will graduate next year, why am I 
even worrying about It? Even If the dorm idea goes 
through, I will not even be here to experience it 

Maybe by then students will have more free time. 

Maybe students will be enrolling at IPFW because of 
the dorms. 

Yeah, that's right 

Students will be enrolling only because of the dorms. 

Whatever.

The Fort Wayne Dance Collective will bring KrU*y Keefer to 
Fort Wayne for her one-woman performance. "Qyeen of Sheba.* 

Keefer ii the Arctsdc Director of the San Francisco Dance 
Brigade/Wicked Witch Production- and Dance Mission Theater. 
She founded the first wo men- identified dance company In the 
country and has produced over 200 performances of her own 
work as well as the work of other choreographers. 

An acclaimed and multi-faceted performer, Krissy Keefer 




has directed and choreographed many productions including 
■The Revolutionary Nutcracker Sweetie." "Pandora"! Box," 
Bloodroots.' 'Cinderella, A Tale of Survival" and "Sleepwalker." 
Her productions have been performed extensively throughout 
the United States, as well as in Nicaragua, Japan and Europe. 

Reefer's deep and passionate commitment to feminist prin- 
ciples inform and enrich her performing, directing, producing 
and teaching. 

Keefer's performance of "Queen of Sheba" combines ele- 
ments of music, dance, drama and political commentary to 
explore the lives of four different character) that represent 
stages of her own life. "The Queen oF Sheba" is an energetic 1 
hour and IS minute look Into Keefer's life through the portray- 
al of character) that range from loosely autobiographi- 
cal to archetypal and mythological. 

In "Queen of Sheba," Keefer appears as Lllllh, the 
dm woman in the Garden of Eden who was banished 
because she refused to lie under Adam: Krissy, an enact- 
ment of Keerer from 16 years old to the present; Lily, an 
Institutionalized media enthusiast; and Queen of Sheba, 
the great cosmic mother and half woman half animal 
whose domain stretched from Ethiopia to India.

Presbyierian Theatre, located at 300 West Wayne Street. 
"We've been In the First Presbyterian Theatre on and 
off for the last 20 years," said Liz Monler. Artistic 
Director of the Dance Collective. "It's really good for a 
one person show, especially since Krissy is going to be 
speaking. There is more Intimacy with the audience 
than In a larger theatre." 

"Krissy's been to Fort Wayne before and when we 
were planning the performance, she specifically asked If 
she could do It In that theater," added Monler. 

The last dme she was In Fort Wayne was 1993 when 
she came here and helped us choreograph a full 
evening-length work called 'Nights of the Round Table.' 
Before that, she was here In 1989 with the full company 
or the San Francisco Dance Brigade," said Monler. "They 
were the first guest company that we presented to the 
Fort Wayne area. Since then, we have been presenting a 
dffcrent company nearly every year."

Collective Studio located at 437 East Berry Street In

Campus musical to examine American political assassinations

Editor 



Hive you ever wondered whai John Wilkes 
Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald would have to 
jay to each other! Apparently Stephen 
Sondholm has. Sondheim li the writer of the 




music and lyrics for the musical 'Assassins.* 
The musical was produced off-Broadway In 
1990 by Playwrlijht Horizons, Inc. New York 
City and will be presented by IPFW this 
weekend. 

"Assassins" Is based upon a book written 
by John Weldman and an original Idea created 
by Charles Gilbert. The musical Sondheim 
wrote, however, not only highlights 
detailed information from 
Weldman's historical piece, but 
throws In a twist of its own-some of

villains from a period of approxi-

They will only fire blanks during the

John Hermes Is an IPFW theater 
student and also the one responsible 
for bringing the musical to IPFW. He 
is working on the musical as his

both the director and the musical 
coordinator for the production. 

Hermes came up with the idea 
to do a Sondheim musical through 
his love for Sondhelm's work and an 
Inspiration to improve upon i

change In time and place and all of that. It's 
thematically linked together Instead of being a 
real one-character follow through." 

Hermes isn't the only person who Is using 
the play as an opportunity to do a senior pro- 
duction project. IPFW student Sarah Lankenau 
Is helping Hermes as the costume designer 
along with Craig Humphrey, associate profes- 
sor of theatre and head of the

by Brian Lindquist, 

Slatf Writer 

"Cobra and Phases Group 
Play Voltage In The Milky 
Night" Is Stcreolab's energetic 
new album on Elektra Records. 
After 1997's extremely popu- 
lar "Dots and Loops," 
Stereolab has once again deliv- 
ered with their magu ,il MltniJ 
of Wurlitier organ, vibra- 
phone and airy French vocals. 
Although only a few of their 
songs are sung in French, 
Stereolab still manages to add 
that special touch of cultural 
&gt; their music. 



The

big band sound as you can get 

without listening to Duke 

Ellington or Count Basie. The 



Irani 






isllni 



'1th a 

phone melody augmented by 
sharp electronic horn blasts. 
Stereolab's trademark clean 
guitar sound carries the har- 
mony with good effect. 

"The Spiracles" slows the 

Stereolab's light Jazz feel and 
ethereal French vocals: 'La 

lumlere des jours d'auiomne. 
qui penetre Irremedlablemcnt 



ct sans violence" or "The light 
of the autumn days, which 
penetrates irreparable and 
without violence." The piano's 
chord progression reminds me 
of "The Clg In the Sky" from 
Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the 
Moon." 

"Op Hop Detonation" fol- 
lows "The Spiracles" with an 
upbeat rock feel complement- 
ed by bursts of electronic nois- 
es and loops. The wooly bass 
line and synthesizer lends a 
60s rock feel, although more 
like Jefferson Airplane than 
Jlmi Hendrlx. 

"Velvet Water" brings 
Stereolab's ubiquitous light 
Jazz feel back to the forefront. 
Much of Stereolab's music is 
based In the Jazz idiom with 
elements of ambient electronic 
noises, loops and beats. Jim 
O'Rourke and John McEntlre 
arc in charge of the recording, 
mixing and production of the 
album and lend their Thrill 
Jockey voices to "Voltage in 
the Milky Night" Those famil- 
iar with Tortoise will hear 
many similarities between the 
two musical groups. 

"Blue Milk" Is like a trib- 
ute to Steve Reich's "Music for 
18 Musicians." Reich is consid- 
ered by most to be the pioneer 



oT modern electronic music. 

"Music for 18 Musicians- 
introduced the concept of 
looped phrases (phrases on 
which other musical phrases 
could evolve and create sonic 
landscapes). The Idea is to cre- 

both moving and stationary, 
expanding and contracting, 
lyrical, dissonant and captivat- 
ing. Stereolab has captured 
this Idea and created a won- 
derful 12-mlnute equivalent to 
Reich's 67-mlnute "Music for 
18 Musicians." 

•Come and Play In the 
Milky Night" is built around 
the same bass texture of "Op 
Hop Detonation." The driving 
rock drums and ambient noise 
bursts create a wonderfully 
comfortable texture that 
envelops the listener in warm 
northern Atlantic breezes. 
Stereolab uses elements of 
lounge and ambient electron!- 
ca to create llstcnable sound- 
scapes apart from normal 
musical realms. "Voltage In 
the Milky Night" Is a wonder- 
ful follow-up to "Dots and 

Anyone In search of an 
alternative musical Journey 
should consider Stereolab 
without reservation.

Women's tennis finishes season with impressive play 



by Brian Miller, 
Spoils Editor 



The women's tennis team 
hu succeufully completed IB 
jeason finishing second In the 
conference behind an Invinci- 
ble Northern Kentucky team. 

"I am really proud of 
what this group has accom- 
plished," men's tennis coach, 
J. Webb Honon said. "We set 
out and accomplished a lot of 
our goals and 1 think 
(wc)have a lot of teams 
preparing for us in the con- 
ference tournament.* 

The team played a match 
In Edwardsvllle this past 
weekend which came down 



■ uldc 



1 Of t 



leader Laura Fisher. 

"Fisher played incredi- 
ble. She Is the warrior of our 
team," Honon said. 'She lost 
the second set 6-0 and rallied 
back and won the third set 6- 
2." 

Fisher captured the spot- 
light for the Dons and posi- 
tioned them as a number two 
seed In the Great Lake Valley 
Conference Tournament. 



The Dons' strength has 
come In the number five and 
ili singles and two and three 

At five singles, the team 
features Christina Pape who 
does what it takes to win. She 
only ha*d two blemishes on 
her record this year and may 
be looked at as a conference 
selection on the ALL-GLVC 

Another honoree could 
be Melissa George. George 

keeps balls In play and Is very 
patient when It comes to her 
style of play. 

George and Pape both 
benefit from the mental sup- 
port aspect of the sport. 

"A lot of teams don't like 
playing us because we don't 
smash the ball back. I think 
our record speaks for Itself 
and It shows that tennis isn't 
Just a brute game but that 
there Is a little finesse, " said 
Honon. 

When It comes to finesse, 
one needs look no further 
than Fisher who, playing at 
number three singles, often 
has the pressure of pulling off 
a victory' or giving up a loss. 

Fisher has pulled out 



three victories for the team 
while managing not to put 
the team In a position to lose. 

Jenna Harmeyer has had 
the task of facing the best or 
the GLVC while playing num- 
ber one singles. Although her 
record might show some dis- 
appointment, overall, her 
leadership and personality 
arc untouched. 

Dawn Caryer has been 
very consistent this year and 
has played very well In the 

Caryer and Harmeyer com- 
bine for the number one dou- 
i"i and will grow Into 



ty," Honon reiterated. "I call 
this team the Kiddle Corp. 
This Is a team that has grown 
together and one that I have

Men's soccer prepares for big weekend 



by Brian Miller, 
Sports Edrior 






•The 



i yet 



That is the case for the IPFW 
men's soccer team which plays 
top-ranked Lewlj University 
and Wisconsin Parkslde on 
Friday and Saturday, 
respectively. 

The team heads Into the 
weekend knowing that they 
could enter post-season play 
for the first time in school 
history. 

"I think this weekend Is 
the biggest, competitive-wise, 
In my 15 years of coaching," 
men's head soccer coach, 
Terry Stefankiewicz said. "I 
don't think some or the play- 
ers know what we can accom- 
plish If we play well and 
knock orr the two teams this 
weekend." 

Is it realistic? "Very!" 
Stefankiewicz said. "We play 
them on our home field and 
have been preparing this 

weekend." 

Lewis and Parkslde have 
two totally different philoso- 
phies with respect to offense. 

Lewis Is a team that gets 
the ball inside to Its players 
and leu them take the majori- 
ty of the shots while the 
Rangers rotate and try to keep 
the defense off guard. Both 
systems have worked well this 



year for each of the teams. 

The Dons are coming 
from a loss to the Indianapolis 
Greyhounds and hope to com- 
bat the loss with a pair of vic- 
tories this weekend. 

"We didn't match up very 
well with Indy," Stefankiewicz 
said. "However, we played 
much better in the second 
half." 

The Dons can't risk 
falling behind In the pair of 
games this weekend. 

The team will be ready 



go, 



ley i 



little 



bruised up. Forwards Ma 
Heln and Chris Kramer are 
having problems with their 
feet and goalkeeper Jeff 
Rlchey has a sprained thumb. 

"These guys are tough," 
Stefankiewicz said. 'They'll 
be ready for this weekend." 

One thing that has 
brought a smite to the face or 
Stefankiewicz has been the 
leadership of his defense. 
"Brian Knitter, Jeff Rlchey and 



Dave Smith really get Involved 
and are being vocal leaden. 
We'll need that type of leader- 
ship on Friday." 

Offensively, the Dons 
have been able to count on 
freshman Ian Luya who has 
scored three goals In four 
games and one additional goal 
which was thrown out via the 
horn sounded at the end of 
the half. 

"Ian has been a pleasant 
surprise. He wasn't anyone we 
counted on when the practice 
began this season, but is a cor- 
nerstone for the team's 
future," said Stefankiewicz. 

This weekend will feature 
an all out battle for the con- 
ference lead and a berth to 
the NCAA Tournament. 

"We need fans and family 
to come out and support us," 
Stefankiewicz said. "This is the 
biggest weekend in IPFW soc- 
cer and we want you to be a

Women's volleyball fall to 
#5 Norse in five games 



by Brian Miller, 
Sports Editor 

The Northern Kentucky 
Norse traveled to the Gates 
Sports Center to square off in 
what could be a preview of 
the Great Lakes Valley 
Conference Tournament Final 
In women's volleyball. 

The Dons, ranked second 
in the region, shared many 
similarities with the fifth- 
ranked Norse, such as a domi- 
nating hitter and superstar 



Ho&gt; 



, this 



Norse team that came out fir- 
ing, white outside hitter Laura 
Douglas wasn't able to find 
her range. 

IPFW started off much 
the same in the second game 
and suffered one of its biggest 
defeats. 

Frustration was setting In 
and it seemed that the team 
was about to lose all hope. 

There was no doubt that 



Northern Kentucky was good, 
but were they this great? 

The Dons came out firing 
and defeated the Norse 1S-6 
In one of their worst losses 
this season. 

Douglas was on her mark, 
however, It was freshman 
Amy Grove that pounded the 
attack. 

By the fourth game, the 
crowd believed that the None 
would come back and would 
not get crushed 1 5-6 again. 

The Dons started where 
they left off In game 3 and 
things started to fall In place. 
After the dust settled, the 
scoreboard again read 15-6, 
leaving a shocked Norse 
bench and an enthusiastic 
Gates Center. 

It was a see-saw battle in 
game five with rally scoring. 
Sideouts killed the Dons and 
the Norse pulled it out 15-12. 

A great game and second 
half effort by the girls showed 
that they can play with the 
best and will be ready for the 
Norse In the conference 
tourney!
