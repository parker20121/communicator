When the people of our nation wish to honor 
someone (or oulslanding achievement, such as giv- 
ing their lives for (he betterment of our country, a 
monument is created in ihal person's memory. Why 
couldn"! the same be done for people who Spend 
iheir lives trying in mike oui school and its stu- 
denls" and faculty members' lives heller? Il is a rel- 
atively ineupcnsis-e thing lhal could nol only make 
our campus more appealing by providing Besthcue

but also honor the contribulions of our often under- 
appreciated profeuon and police oriicers after they

memorial of 

lype has been long overdue. It seems as though 

not a semester passes without our campus eipen- 

encing this son of lo.u and seemingly little is dorte 

lo rectify it. 

It IS incumbent upon the faculty and student 
Itody to create some sort of lasting way lo honor 
these people through the creation of an on -cam pus 
monument. Be it through donations from Ihc cam- 
pus and community, a senior class graduation pres- 
ent or whatever, this is a project into which ii is 
worth invctiing both time and money. It will not 
only cose the pain caused by the passing of such 
imponani members of our campus, but il will nlio

The 2001 Indiana General Assembly is sched- 
uled to end April 29. The events of the next few days 
will dclerminc the success or failure of all our work 
on energy, utility and long term care issues. 

Our campaigns on both utility and long term 
care issues now come down to what happens in two 
commilices. consisting of just four lawmakers 

With bolh our utility and long term care bills, 
Ihe House and the Senate have passed different ver- 
sions of these bills. This means a four-person con- 
ference committee will now iron out differences 
between Ihe Iwo versions and create a Final version, 
which will be relumed lo the General Assembly for 
final passage. The decisions made this week by eight 
people will affect our state for years to come. 

Now. more than at any time this year, we will 
need help from all of you lo ensure Ihe interests of 
Indiana consumers and laipayers are redecled in the 
linal versions of Ihcse bills!

The House of Represenlativ

The House PASSED House Bill (HBl IISI, 
which would have finally given slate regulators-the 
Indiana Uliliiy Regulatory Commission-thc author- 
ity to fine utilities which violate the law and do naU 
mcel service quality standards. 

The House PASSED HB 1979. which would 
have established lhal the lURC has aulhority over 
the suing of natural gai-buming "mercham" power 
planus and would have eslablishcd standards for the 
siting of these plants. This would have ensured lhal 
Indiana is not unfairly targeted by oul-of-stale power 
companies who use Indiana's Ian regulatory environ- 
ment to overbuild these plants here, thereby contin- 
uing to drive up Ihe demand for and cost of natural 
gas. (For an excellent article on merchant plants and 
the Suiehouse fight over HB 1979. go lo

The House PASSED HB 1924, which would 
have established thai Ihc lURC has authority lo 
review mergers between the holding companies 
which now own most utilities. This would have 
allowed Indiana to negotiate, during merger talks to

adding a historical feel that 
enhances game play quite a bit. 

'Tale of the Dragon" iiti- 
lilcs a real time game engine 
reminiscent of such classic war 
games as "Warcraft" and "Age 
of Empiies ." In fact. "Fate of 
the Dragon" is nearly identical 
to Ihesc games In almost all of 
lis game play ispecii Players 
are forced lo build up their 
infiiistniclure before they can 
do anything with units and. in 
fact, arc responsible for raising 
units themselves via construct- 
ing buildings. There are some 
significant dilTerences. such as 
the details of things like farms 
and mines, but much of it is 
similar. The building styles are 
different, but their overall pur- 
pose isn't. In this aspect. "Fate 
of (he Dragon" seems like 
another "Warcraft" rip off. 

One of Ihe major charac- 
teristics of the game that sepa- 
rates it from the other games m 
its genre is its slory line. Once 
again, a game is saved by the

players are given the aniuous 
task to defeat the others and

way. generals from the series 
such as Guan Yu. Zhao Yun and 
countless othen join sides to 
faciliiaic the efforts of Iheir 
masters. It is really a fascinat- 
ing story line for those familiar 
with Ihe slory. 

For those who aren't 
familiar with the slory, another 
computer game le I eased by

song ihal stands out on llie album. Il made its 
debut in 2000 in the film "Nufy Professor 2; The 
Klumps" It's last plain fun. 

Accoidin; to Yahoo.com. Jackson created

was separaiing (mm 
-husband Rene 



"All For You." is the center 
piece of the album. At press 
lime, It was ranked numbci 1-1 
on Billboard's Hot 100 
Jackson's producer bdrrowcd 
this music from "Change." an 
'SOs disco/R&amp;B group led b&gt; 
Luther Vandioss. "All For 
You" stems from Iheir song. 
"The Glow of Love." 

The song has an upbcal, 
fun mood to it II would be gte

"Come on Gel Up," Hack fii 
anodiei upbeal song Ih at would

The beat and the mood of ihc album 
slows doivn wiih .i^ngs such a.. "When We Oiw,' 
"China Love," "Love Scene" and "Would You 
Mind " These arc low key lunes which have few 
differences besides the lyrics. Jaekion'i mood 
changes complclely. moving from making love 
and falling into love lo male hashing nilh the 
inicrtuite "Lame." This interlude seems inappio 
prialc and oui of place, "You men.. You men are 
]usl lame al limes," sings Jackson. 

Her commenlary leads into 'Tnirt a Try," 




die "Oulro." 

In my opinion. Ihis is a 
group of songs Ihal was put 
logcther in a hurry. They di* 
not mesh well together, to 
the ciealors insered inter- 
ludes to mark tlie mood of 
ihc music. Perhaps Ihey weic 
irying lo create moodswings. 

Pve listened lo Jackson 
since high school and I've 
enjoyed such songs as 
"Thai's the Way Love Goes." 
'Together Again," "If and 
"Scream." I believe she's a 
reputable artisi and she has 
worked for a reasonable 
amouni of time lo attain her 
status in the muiic industry-

Cosch Ooue Noll IS etcited about the 
transition lo Dmsion I. -TTiis is Ihc first 
time in my ten years of coaching ihat we're 
able to give out some full ndcv* 

IPFW is in a unique situation in 
recruiting. Noll is able lo offer his athletes 
not only a degree from a Big Ten 
University, but their choice in Big Ten 
degrees^ either Purdue or Indiana. 

Without a Purdue degree. Njic proba- 
bly would nol have iransferred here. IPFW 
can offer the best of both worlds, a feature 
that many schools arc unable to compete 

Noll is quick (o acknowledge that 
although his recTUils bring a lot to hij team, 
leadership must come from his eipcnenccd 
players, "I look for (Nick| Wise lo lead this 
team off and on Ihe court." 

IPFW has recruited four players with 
Division 1 playing experience. With die 
increase in e:tperience and ability of his 
players. Noll said. '(Our| skill level rises a 
lot. but on the other hand, our schedule 
changes a lot.* 

Noll has put together an Impressive 
travel schedule for the 



IPFW will open up the season on 
Nov. 16. SI the Memonal Coliseum against 
Morcbead Sute and will s-isil teams such 
aj Michigan State, Michigan, Ball Stale 
and Eistem Illinois ihroughoul the season. 

When playing such teams. Noll said 
that, "w-e have lo go into it like we're going 
lo win the game," 

Noll Slid thai hit new lecruiis will 
better fit into the system. "We're more 
comfortable with an up-lempo game.' he 
said. "We can betler implement the press

Keeping ihc season in perspective. 
Noll said. 'We know we have lu crawl 
before we can walk." 

Attaining this group of quality 
recruits is a prelly good indication thcy'le 
off to a good crawl already 

Noll sees the need for IPRV to join a 
conference and envisions his leam becom- 
ing compeliiivc in (he conference very 

As conferences considered, the Mid- 
Contineni is ihrown around a lot. Noll said.
