student services improved 'Since culture wuz different ' 



about the student s__ . ._ 

Just seven years ago, student services consisted of an assistant dean, an 
activities director and a part-time testing officer. There were other counselors, 
coordinators, directors and whal-have-you's all over campus. It is not hard to 
imagine the quality of the service with that kind of set-up. 

A consolidation of this mess started in 1971. Personnel were reassigned to a 
single administrative unit for better efficiency. New services such as student 
health, career counseling and placement, veterans' services, child day care, 
tutorial services were developed. Other existing services like counseling and 
testing, athletics, financial aids were improved. 

The amazing thing about the consolidation is that the level of services 
substantially improved while the budget remained about the same. Only one 
additional professional staff member has been added since the merge.
