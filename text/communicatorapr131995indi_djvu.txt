Budget battle escalates into war of words 



By Melissa Young-Flores 
Chief Reporter 

As the annual ritual of budget plan- 
ning continues, debate has sparked over 
the allocalion of siudcnt fees. Currently, 
ihc athletic department and IPSGA 
divide the funds 60/40 in the athletic 
department's favor. 

A change, however does not seem 
possible in the near future. Vice 
Chancellor of Sludent Affairs Frank 
Borelli said, "I think il is going to stay 
how it is and as far as I know, there is no 
intent to change il" 

Dean of Students Marian 
Zimmerman agreed with Borelli and 
believes il may be unfortunaie, but ath- 
letics is Ihc number one facility in need 
of funding. 

" Athletics needs all the money they 
can get until they can get on their reel," 
Zimmerman said. "It is a matter of prior- 
ities, and that is where the priority is 
now." 

Zimmerman commented however, 
that the athletic department also "sup- 
ports physical wellness for everybody." 

Although Zimmerman believes Ibe 
60/40 split meets the current priorities, 



she said that the students arc also feeling 
a pinch. 

IPSGA Vice President of Finance 
Michael Heit said he too docs not 
believe the split will undergo a meta- 
morphosis. "I didn't expect it to change, 
and I do not expect it to change," Heit 
said. "Right now Students' Government 
will have to adapt and hopefully not 
underfund too many programs." 

Borelli said, however, the pinch 
could be less painful with proper priori- 
tizing. "It is a matter of bow they priori- 
tize their budget. The requests always 
exceed the money." 

Heit believes IPSGA members do the 
best they can with what they have, and a 
portion of the budget goes to fund acad- 
emic programs, which is not IPSGA's 
place. 

Heit said however, the Students' 
Government will noi eliminate those 
programs from the budget because they 
benefit many students. He did point oui 
that it was not the duty of IPSGA to 
fund such programs. Sludent govern- 
ment's position in the university is to 
provide "social, cultural, and economic" 
activities for the campus, according to 
Heit. 



"I've been in this office for two 
years, and I have done belter than the 
lasi two vice presidents of finance. I am 
going to be here a third year, and if I 
can't do my job by now Frank needs lo 
come and hold my hand," Heit said. 

Heit specifically mentioned the stu- 
dent handbooks and the tutoring pro- 
gram as items which IPSGA docs not 
have 10 help fund. "If Frank is going to 
dictate the budget, then let him take care 
of it," said Heil. 

Borelli commented mat the student 
service fees were raised to ensure that 
IPSGA's net income would still be the 
same, but conceded (hat the athletics 
budget grew with the raise as well. 

Athletic Director Bulch Pcrcban said 
the athletic department is also feeling 
the pinch, but also slated the department 
is working to raise more money in ihc 
community. 

"Compared to my odier experiences 
this athletic department is well under- 
funded." said Perchan. 

According to Perchan, the pressing 
plan for the department is to generate 
enough funds from the community lo 
cover the collegiate spons in order to 
use all or mosi of the studenl fees for the 



wellness program and intramural pro- 
grams. 

Perchan hopes to boost funding while 
also giving students more "bang for their 
buck." Perchan said that students often 
do not want lo pay an athletic fee. but 
are willing lo pay a fee for wellness pro- 
grams. 

According to Perchan. student input 
will be a major factor in developing the 
options available to non-athlciic stu- 
dents. "Ours plans are to start building a 
case with IPSGA lo start to see what stu- 
dents want," said Perchan. "What do the 
students want from athletics?" 

Perchan hopes lo entice more stu- 
dents to take advantage of the facilities 
they are already paying for. "We arc 
developing a marketing plan at three 
groups," said Perchan. Those groups 
included the both traditional and non- 
traditional students, the staff, faculty and 
businesses. 

Although both sides of Ihc money 
split are experiencing a financial pinch, 
(he ultimate decision of allocation of 
funds lies in Chancellor Michael 
Wartell's hands,

The best Quaker Mini Rice Cakes 



By Kura Whiting 
Features Editor 

This week's victims of the infamous "In 
Scaich of. . ." arc of more of a healthy 
nature. I decided to try more healthy foods 
due to the increase in weight thai my body 
has gone through at the expense of this 
ankle. So in order to decrease my weight, 
and keep this wonderful article going, I 
went to the grocery and found Quaker Mini 
Rice Cakes. 

I found that there arc a variety of flavors 
from which to choose. In fact, there are 
seven different flavors in this particular 
category of Quaker Mini Rice Cakes. 
Those flavors arc as follows; White 
Cheddar, Banana Crunch, Butter Popped 
Corn. Honey Nut. Apple Cinnamon, 
Cinnamon Crunch and Caramel Com. 

This week's rating system is based on 
the traditional one bite, two bite, three bite, 
four bite system. To review this again for 
those of you who do not remember from 
week to week, here goes: one bite means 



the product needs to go back to the kitchen 
immediately: two bites mean (hat the prod- 
uct is okay, but lets face it folks, it needs 
help: three bites means it is much better. 
but something is surely missing; four bites 
means theproduct is truly amazing. 
, Let the games begin.

Hello, people, this rice cake needs help. 
I do not know what happened in the 
Quaker kitchen on this one. but something 
was severely wrong with this particular 
rice cake. First of all, the taste was awful. 
The taste was too strong and the whole 
concept of having a white cheddar flavored 
rice cake is not a good one. I can not even 
begin to explain what this tasted like but I 
can tell you this much: I wouldn't even 
give this to my dog. The only redeeming 
quality about this rice cake is that it is fat 
free for all of you health freaks. But I 
wouldn't recommend this for a midnight 
snack, ever. My final rating is negative one 
bite for the White Cheddar flavor. Go back 



to me kitchen, Quaker. 

BANANA CRUNCH RICE CAKES 
This particular rice cake was interesting 
to say the least. But in a general sense I 
would not run out and buy this as my first 
choice. The taste itself was dry and lasted 
like real banana. And again there is no fat!! 
You gotta love fat-free food, but one 
requirement should be taste. And this par- 
ticular rice cake is lacking in the taste 
department. So for a final rating I give the 
Banana Crunch flavor only one bite out of 
a possible four. 

BUTTER POPPED CORN RICE 

CAKES 
Well, this one is about as good as the 
White Cheddar flavor. Indeed, this rice 
cake is very buttery tasting, for a rice cake. 
A rice cake should be sweet and simple: 
butter- popped, com-flavored rice cakes are 
neither sweet nor simple. If you want but- 
ter-popped com go to the movies I can not 
go on any further because I would basically 
be repeating myself over and over. So 
without further adieu this rice cake docs 



not receive any bites at all. 

HONEY NUT RICE CAKES 
Wow! After torturing my lastebuds 
thoroughly on those so-called rice cakes. 1 
found one (hat has a little taste. And I 
stress little. This rice cake was very bland 
and not as honied as it should have been or 
could have been. But as with all the other 
rice cakes by Quaker, the one redeeming 
quality is the fact that they arc fat-free. If 
there was more taste (hen I would give this 
rice cake a higher rating, but unfortunately 
there is not. Therefore, my rating for 
Honey Nut rice cakes is a two out of a pos- 
sible four. Better luek next time. 

APPLE CINNAMON RICE CAKES 
MMMM good is all I have to say, I 
have always been a fan of this flavor and 
will remain faithful. Since this is fat free 

and sooo delicious I just can not bear to go 
on anymore. This rice cake was very satis- 
fying and almost perfect. My final rating is 
four bites out of a possible four. Way to 



CINNAMON CRUNCH RICE CAKES 
Wow! If I thought the Apple Cinnamon 
was good, I obviously had not tried the 
Cinnamon Crunch flavor. The crunch was 
good as well as the great cinnamony (if 
that is a word) taste. I loved every one of 
the rice cakes that I devoured. And believe 
you me, I ate a lot. My final rating for this 
fat-free Cinnamon Crunch flavor is thrce- 
and-a-half bites out of three. 

CARAMEL CORN RICE CAKES 
Oh help me now. I had never tasted any- 
thing this good in a long time. Except the 
Ben and Jerry's I had the other day, but 
that is another story all together. This fla- 
vor is very satisfying and I would recom- 
mend this one to anyone who likes rice 
cakes and has yet to try this one. Even 
though the caramel flavor was not very 
strong, it was (here and actually made the 
rice cake more edible than those strong 
White Cheddar and Butler Popped Com 
flavors. My final rating for this perfect rice 
cake is five bites out of a possible four. 



MUSIC REVIEW: 

ANNIE LENNOX'S SOLO ALPOM SCORES PIG 



By I'aulTupper 
Features Writer 

The problem with most cover 
albums is cither the weak songs the 
artist chooses (see "Hold Me, Thrill 
Me, Kiss Me" by Gloria Estefan), 
or the stale carbon copy arrange- 
ments of the originaLs that (he artist 
makes (sec "Songs" by Luiher 
Vandross). So rarely do we hear an 
album of covers by an artist that is 
truly a representation of the musi- 
cian. Too often, a cover album is a 
collection of hit songs remade to 
make a hit album. 

This is not the case with 
"Medusa" by Annie Lennox. 

At the start of her career, Lennox 
was made a puppet by her former 
Eurythmics partner David Stewart. 
And in fact, if you were to compare 
the Eurythmics "Greatest Hits" with 
Lennox's solo debut "Diva," you 
would understand what I mean. 
Stewart was the creative master- 
mind behind the group and Lennox 
was the interpreter. This marriage 
of producer and singer certainly 
made a mark in eighties music, but 
the songs were often lame and 
i pointless. Yet Lennox was able to 
wrap her voice around each song 
i and create something of an enigma. 

"Diva" meant the artist had to do 
her own song writing and produc- 
ing, without relying on Stewart. 
What was released was a body of 
work that was the most personal 
("Little Bird") and the most autobi- 
ographical ("Money Can't Buy It") 
than anything that the Eurythmics 
ever put out. One can say thai her 
time in the group was a training 
ground for what was really meant to 
become of Annie Lennox. 

Sophomore albums are for some 
reason a tough hill for many artists 
to climb, and are often nol success- 
ful (ask Color Me Badd or George 
Michael). Lennox will not have this 
problem "Medusa" is a work of art 
suitable for the finest museums. She 
has chosen lo record a baich of 
songs from other artists that may 
not have been successful, yet 
deserve be heard by a large audi- 
ence because of the quality of the 
excellent writing. 

Lennox has taken songs written 
by such diverse creators as Paul 
Simon, Neil Young, Al Green and 
Bob Marley, and made them her 
own without compromising the 
integrity of the original versions. 
It's not just Lennox's voice you

INDIANAPOLIS 




You's*" is a little song from an 
English band, The Lover's Speak. 
She interprets the song to be about 
the repctitivencss of love and the 
overuse of the four letter word. The 
original sounds like something this 
side of the Lcmonheads. 

The journey continues with 
"Take Me To The River" written by 



sion barely 
sounds like 
the original. 
i Lennox 

takes you to 
a climax at 
the end of it 
without you 
realizing 
that you've been moving. 

My favorite song is the closer 
"Something So Right" written by 
Simon. This song is destined to 
become the new favorite wedding 
song ("Some people never say the 
words I love you, but like a child 
they're longing to be told). Put this 
on when you want to woo someone 



off their feet. 

Some may argue that Lennox is 
compromising her creativity by 
recording an album full of cover 
tunes. But once they hear "Medusa" 
they will sec that this is the most 
creative album of the year. I give 
this CD the ultimate score of a 10 
out of a possible 10. 

If you disagree with the notion 
of Lennox being the true reason for 
Eurythmics success, ask yourself 
this question: Did you know David 
Stewart now has a solo album out? 
Didn't think so. ,

The Silver Screen Reviews X*^ 
'Don Juan DeMarco' 



By Kara Whiting 

, Features Editor 

When 1 went to the movies this last weekend. I 

/as not to sure what I wanted to sec. I ended up see- 

I ing Johnny Depp's new flick, "Don Juan DeMarco." 

| Afier paying S5.50 I am still not sure if ibis movie is 

| recommcndablc or not. 

First of all the movie was really slow-paced and 

made me want to scream in the middle of it because I 

| just wanted it to be over. Dut the story of a mod- 

From the Editor's desk... 



crn day Don Juan was interesting. 

Many of us know that by referring to someone as 
"Don Juan" we mean that this particular gentleman 
has an uncanny affect on women. In "Don Juan 
DeMarco" Johnny Depp portrays a young man who 
believes he is the actual Don Juan. Frankly. I was 
beginning to believe it myself. 

Marlon Brando plays a psychiatrist who is about 
to retire but ends up listening to Don Juan 
DcMarco's story, and it is quite romantic. Don Juan 
DcMarco's train of thought is very enticing and 



allows Brando's character to dream of a life he 
never known. 

The humor in this movie is slight, but noneihi 
funny when noticed. I did indeed laugh out loud 
1 do that rarely when it comes to movies, book: 
the like. 

If you like to dream and are longing for a 
perfect world, then sec "Don Juan DeMarco" and 
you will be mesmerized by the mystical approach 
this flick takes. My final rating is only two-and-a- 
half junior mints out of a possible four.

Republicans failed 

to keep their promises 



The Republicans" first 100 days

they were going 10 do? 

Nope. Most of Hit bills thai made

through the Senate, and their future 
remains uncertain. 

Are the American people sur- 
prised? 
Nope. 

In a poll conducted Tor the 
[Washington Post, 60 percent of the 
people polled said the actions by con- 
jgrcssional Republicans represent 
'business as usual. Just goes to show 
that you can'l teach an old dog new

i Representative Steve Buyer, R-5ih 
was quoted in the Journal Gazette as 

■ saying, 'Today is a historical day, a 
day in which a group of elected offi- 
cials have actually delivered on their 
campaign promises." 

They did not deliver on their cam- 

'. paign promises. The only bill that 
has actually been signed into law is a 

1 bill lo discourage Congress from 
imposing requirements on slates and 

! cities without providing money to pay

Thai is a (at cry from the success 



Commentan 



the Republicans arc claiming. 

The Republicans greatly overesti- 
mated their ability to change the way 
Congress operates. Their failure goes 
to show that the workings of 
Congress take time, time the 
Republicans no longer have. 

Maybe some of the bills that made 
it through the House will eventually 
make it into law. Most of them prob- 
ably will not. 

In their contract with America all 
republicans promised to do was to 
bring these issues to a vote in the 
House. This is the victory they are 
claiming, but it is a hollow victory. 

What is the use in bringing these 
bills to a vote if they will die in the 
Senate? Hopefully the American peo- 
ple have noticed the hypocrisy in the 
Republican's victory and will keep 
this in mind when the presidential 
elections come around. 

Politicians are politicians. The 
Republican's failure just goes to 
show that they make promises they 
can not keep. They do this to entice 
the American people into voting them 
into office. 

Check out the politician's track 
record before you vole. The person 
you arc inclined to vote for is proba- 
bly quite different from the picture 
his or her campaign manager has 
painted through the press.

A surefire ticket to dating hell 



Do you wont a ticket straight to 
"Dating Hell?" It's easy . . .just 
. have one of your friends who hap- 
pens to be in a puppy loving rela- 
lionship set you up. It happens! For 
a faster descent 
into dale hell, 
have your 
mother set you 




your own damn business. 

1 know I'm not the only person 
who has bad a friend try to set 
them up. What gives my friends 
the right to mess with my busi- 
ness? Just because they arc so 
rcvoltingly happy do they have to 
try and extend their lovingly 
vomit-like relationship to all their 
friends? 

Those nauseating couples think 
that just because I have one minor 
thing in common with some ran- 
dom female (example: "You both 
have three letter first names, you 
should go out") they have the right 
to set me up. Thank you very little 



for the help! 

I know I am no prize, but as a 
dating rule, I prefer to have more 
facial hair than my dates. 

In addition lo the "no facial 
hair" rule, here are a few more I try 
to follow: 

•Never go out with any girl 
whose father calls her "Princess;" 
chances are she believes it. 

•Never go out with anyone who 
has pet names for their acne. 

•Always take a beeper with you 
so you can trigger it yourself and 
get out before the appetizer arrives, 

•Never go out with a woman 
who has pierced nipples unless you 
have matching caring s, 

I'm happy for all those hideous- 
ly contented couples, but deep 
down I wish they would break up 
so 1 would have the chance to spice 
up their dates with some psychotic 
parolee. 1 feel it would be my duty 
as a single person to make their 
lives a modem version of Dante's 
Inferno. 1 would set them up with 
seven different dates with each one 
descending more and more into 
Hell and I could be their guide, a 
modem day Virgil, if you will.

Commentary 



Media unfair to Republicans 

Print media hunts down GOP 




s old guard has 
minds and fresh 
ideas from 
breaking in the 
door. 

1 have 
read wilh dis- 
taste and dis- 
appointment 
the many 
columns (and 
at least one 
staff editorial!) 
which have 
painted con- 
gressional progress in the last 100 
days as a dismal failure. 

For all you naysayers, 
allow me to quote Sylvia Smith, 
Washington editor of that bulwark 
of conservative journalism, the 
Journal Gazette, as saying, "For 
the most part, what emerged from 
the House was in sync wilh the 
contract" 

Two highly visible fail- 
ures, amplified by our faithful 
media, have given The Contract 
with America a black eye. 
Incidentally, those two failures are 
old ones which haunted recent 
Republican administrations when 
dealing with a Democratic 
Congress. 

Congress rejected two 
constitutional amendments to 
impose term limits and require a 
balanced budget. Unfortunately, 
the public has not evaluated the 
new congress's performance as a 
package, but has picked it apart 
and focused in detail on the 
wounds suffered by the 
Republican Party. 

That Americans have not 
recognized Congress's better luck 
thus far in progressing a line-item 
veto, overhauling welfare, casing 
the legal burden on small busi- 
nesses and combatting crime is 
partly the fault of the mass media. 
While I thought Smith 
portrayed the Republican Party's 
fortunes fairly in last Sunday's 
article titled. "The contract gets a 
curtain call," the media in general 



has leaned very much toward the 
Democrats while covering the 
Congress in Washington. 

The Republicans are 
receiving much negative press for 
a pair of legislative failures. By 
contrast, I have heard or seen few 
diatribes against the Democratic 
Party or the Clinton administra- 
tion, which has helped send some 
of the Republican Party's mea- 
sures down in highly-publicized 
flames. 

Bill Clinton won the pres- 
idency late in 1992 partly on a 
pledge to end gridlock. Two years 
later, the Republicans took control 
of Congress and suddenly 
Clinton's vow to make Congress 
progress instead of stagnate 
seemed to become conditional. 

The American people 
removed scores of incumbent 
Democrats in favor or their fresh- 
faced opponents and, hopefully, in 
favor of change. Once again, the 
president and Congress appear to 
be at odds over policy. 

Should the status remain 
quo for the next 18 months, the 
Republican Party will probably, 
and rightly, level the same accusa- 
tion of "gridlock" on the 
Democrats. 

Hopefully, the print media 
will, as was practice in the past, 
cite a stubborn president (and sup- 
porting party) as the roadblock to 
the progress requested by the vot-

Homosexually Speaking 

Diversity needed among faculty 



Diversity. A goal this campus 
is trying to achieve. Is it possible? 
I think so; this campus is currently 
more diverse than you may real- 
ize. Many of the students here arc 
of non-whiic, non-American her- 
itage. And yes. many of the stu- 
dents here arc non-heterosexuals 
as well. 

But the current focus is on Ihe 
faculty. We have few faculty 
members who are non-white, non- 
American, and stop the presses, 
non-heterosexual.' But these num- 
bers are very low. In the two years 
that I have been attending here. I 
have only once had a professor 
that was not 




son. Yet Ihis person is not able lo 
be himself or herself around cam- 
pus for fear of losing his or her 
position. My non-American pro- 
fessors could be themselves, yet 
my non-heierosexual professor 
cannot. 

This is a person who was very 
live in his or bur native city, but 
here must remain silent to protect 
his or her job status That's kind 
of like volunteering at a homeless 
shelter in one cily, only to move to 
another city and be forced to not 
help the needy. 



Kevin Eads, our newly elected 
student government president, is 
dedicated to finding more African- 
American professors and adminis- 
trators, and I will gladly be the 
first one to join the search. 
College and education is about 
expanding our minds; what better 
way to do so than with educators 
with different backgrounds than 
our own! Not that my white, 
American, heterosexual professors 
are not doing their jobs, mind you; 
to the contrary. But I look forward 
lo die day when I can say that my 
influences aie of a wide range and 
variety. , 

For the time being, I would like 
to concentrate on the current staff. 
With the exception of one, that 
being the multitalentcd, cordial, 
helpful, and overall wonderful 
Larry Life, we don't have any 
openly gay faculty. There are so 
many, of various different titles, 
who lead gay lives outside of 
IPFW. Yet when they walk on 
campus they leave their gayncss at 
home. Now I support separation of 
work and personal life, but I don't 
understand how any other profes- 
sor can interject bis or her lifestyle 
without allowing the gay faculty 
to do so as well. 

So let us all support Kevin and 
others who are dedicated in diver- 
sifying this campus, but we must 
not forget the gays that are here 
presently and not open about who 
they are. If we are truly going to 
be diverse, then these gays should 
be able to open up without losing 
their jobs or credibility.

To the editor: 

As a person who is newly 
arrived on the campus of IPFW. I 
would like to compliment two 
groups of young people who do a 
great deal for the University with 
hide recognition. A BIG THANK 
YOU to the members of the PEP 
BAND and the CHEERLEADING 



CREW!!! In the short time I have 
been on campus (three weeks and 
six athletic events), it has been a 
pleasure watching and listening to 
both of these groups. They gener- 
ate a great deal of enthusiasm from 
the crowd and add a real sense of 
entertainment to our athleuc events. 
Giving one's time and support to 



your university takes a special kind 
of person. Many thanks to the Pep 
Band and Cheerleaders from all of 
us in Intercollegiate Athletics. We 
look forward to your continuing 
support in the years to come.

Columnist lacks awareness of language 



While reading Paul Tupper's 
column 1 was taken by surprise at 
Mr. Tupper's apparent lack of com- 
mon sense. I am referring to his use 
of the term "breeders" to denote 
heterosexuals. 

I would assume Mr. Tupper is 
particularly sensitive to language 
used by heterosexuals in reference 
to homosexuals. He must be beld to 



the same standards be expects from 
others. 

I should be able to expect more 
from Mr. Tupper and his editor as 
responsible journalists. This inci- 
dent shows me that I cannot 

The goal of a journalist should 
be clarity. If Mr. Tupper means het- 
erosexual, be should say heterosex- 
ual. Mr. Tupper's behavior as a 



journalist only gives encourage- 
ment to others who misuse our lan- 
guage. 

I believe a sharp rebuke from his 
editor is in order and quite possibly 
an apology from Mr. Tupper also. 

Sincerely.

By Mandisa I,. Holmes

Amic Ball. The Volleydons were able to 
dig and block many balls, scoring sever- 
al points and frustrating the Flyers' 
offense. 

Both teams played a high level of 
defense. The Flyers were able to dig 18 
balls in the first malch; Sinisha Dordcvic 
lead them wilh five along with four kills. 
K wasn't the defense thai hurl the Flyers, 
noicd Ihe Lewis coach Dave Dcuser; it 
was their outside hitters. "We were 



unable lo gel them involved, and ihey 
were quile'ineffectivc lonighl," he said. 

The Volleydons defeated the Flyers, 
15-12. 15-10. 15-12, which was IPFW's 
first victory after suffering six straight 
losses. Their overall record is 8-3 and 
they are now ranked third in the confer-

University and also Ball State 
Universiiy. These teams arc ranked one 
and two in the conference. Lewis has 
also defeated the University of 



California which is ranked in the lop 10

Ball used a different line-up which he 
says is more effective. He said he thinks 
the line-up he used Friday, which con- 
sisted of Collins. Ralat. Ricardo Solar. 
Mike Tier Molen, Chris Farmer and 
Scott Laucr setting, was the most effec- 
tive line-up at this point. He said he feels

Phi Kappa Theta honored for charity work 



liy MelbSfl Young-Florcs 
Chief Reporter 

The Indiana Conference of 
Higher Education presented the 
1PFW chapicr of Phi Theia Kappa a 
public service award. The fraternity 
earned this award for its participa- 
tion in the restoration of the campus 
child care center which will open 
this fail. 

According lo Mary Brant, stu- 
dent employment coordinator, the 
Indiana Campus Compact granted 
the funds for the project. The pro- 
ject was developed through federal 
legislation directed lo give college 
students more opportunity to par- 
ticipate in community service. 

George Gounaris, vice president 
of Phi Kappa Theta, believes the 
award is a sign to the campus that 
Greeks arc productive members of 
the campus. 

"It lets people sec that Greeks do 
make an attempt to do community 
service, and it is nice lo receive an 
award for such," Gounaris said. 

Fraternity brother Kurt Frcmion 
said he is glad that (he group was 
acknowledged for a positive contri- 
bution to the university. 

"I'm glad to sec that we finally 
got recognized for doing something 
positive for the campus instead of 
throwing a party," Frcmion said. 

"We are happy 10 receive and we 
hope in the future to become more 
involved in this campus," Anthony 
Romano, a Phi Kappa Theta broth- 



er, said. "Il is an honor and a sign 
of our commitment to community 
service and to this campus." 

Romano said the fraternity 
would like to gel others involved in 
community service and campus 
activities. 

"Through our involvement on 
the campus we would like to gel 
others involved. We would like to 
get a larger percentage of the cam- 
pus involved rather (han a select 
few," said Romano. 

Each year the Indiana 
Conference of Higher Education 
inviics each IU campus lo nomi- 
nate a group for the award. 

"All campuses were asked lo 
nominate someone," Brant said. 
"This only the second year dial our 
campus has participated." 

"There is a push on this campus 
and in the state for community ser- 
vice," said Brant. "But would there 
be as many projects if there weren't 
any funding?" 

Brant said she hopes students 
would find time to raise funds in 
order to continue service to their 
university and community. 

According to Phi Kappa Theta 
ritual officer Mark King, the frater- 
nity will actually begin their work 
on the child care center no laler 
than July. 

"We are jusi waiting on the 
Physical Plant lo come up wilh a 
maintenance schedule to sec when 
wc can get in," King said. 

King said several renovations 



need lo be done to the facility 
before the group can even begin. 

The child care cenicr will open 
ai ihc beginning of ihc fall semes- 
ter. The center accepted applies 



ijons last week for ihe fall semes- 
ter. For more information concern- 
ing the child care center conlaci the
