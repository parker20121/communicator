W. Bush has been declared 
victor, winning the popular vote 
and Electoral College - albeit 
by a slight margin. 

In Indiana, Bush won with 
a more pronounced lead than in 
the general electorate. The final 
count of college-age voles (vot- 
ers 18-25), however, was far 
closer, with Bush receiving 52 
percent of the vote as opposed 



to 60 percent in the overall 
vote. This polarity of politics 
and vision for the country is 
apparent in opinion on the 
IPFW campus. 

Junior Scott Mclean, an 
OLS major at IPFW, voted for 
Bush and was pleased by the 
outcome of the election. To him 
the War on Terror was the

elected, we would be way 

behind on the action in the 

Middle-East." 

Joe Williams, a former 
IPFW student, also thought the 
war was the most important 
issue, but he voted for Kerry. 
Williams thinks the war was a 
mistake, because it has shifted 
the country's attention away 
from domestic issues.

Herbert also mentioned 
the future plans to allow stu-

"We live ten minutes

for us lo stay here for classes. 
We usually stay in Classroom

Other than students in 
Walb where is everyone else? 
Some go to Gates to work on 
their physical well-being. "Our 
busiest time is between noon 
and three, wc see an average of 
about 60 people at that time 
each day," said Randy 
Kilbome. Kilbome works at 
Gates Information Desk. 

How about campus social- 
izing? 

When talking with fresh- 
man Dara Aldrich about the 
social atmosphere at IPFW, she 
suggested that college is sup- 
posed to be a time of self dis- 
covery and new experiences. 
Meeting new people is a part of

Do students at IPFW 
socialize with people they don't 
already know? In class, yes, it's 
almost impossible nol to, bui 
outside of class students sit 
right next to each other for 
sometimes a long while and still 
can remain silent and not 
acknowledge each others exis- 

Thai is amazing. Aldrich 
adds that, "outside of class peo- 
ple seem really reserved. 
Everyone keeps to themselves 
It's like they have a reason lobe 
here and a place lo go and that 
is all they are really worried 

Students always have 
computer labs and the library 
but these places have a tenden- 
cy to get boring so how about 
something to spice up college 
life when students are stuck on 
campus? 

Gates Sports Center is 
open Monday through 
Thursday 5:30 a.m. to 10 p.m..

Diversity fair Nov. 17 



The Communicator 

IPFW houses a colorful 
variety of people and diverse 
cultures. A campus festival 
"Opening Our Eyes: A Cross 
Cultural Celebration" is hoping 
lo bring them all together at one 

The free celebration which 
offers beverages, food and a 
sampling of music, displays and 
a representation of people from 
many cultures will take place 
from noon until 3 p.m. on Nov. 
17 in Walb Student Union 
Ballroom. 

Sponsored by 

Multicultural Services and The 
Psychology Club, the event will 
be open to IPFW students and 
faculty as well as the local Fort 
Wayne community with one 
canned good item upon admis- 

Students from Dr. Jeanie 
DiClementi's Cross Cultural 
Psychology class are responsi- 
ble for putting the celebration 
together intermingling the com- 
munity and campus as a class 
project.

the festivities firsthand and is 
looking forward to the evenl. 
"This festival is a unique 



first of its kind event here at 
IPFW. People are hearing a 
rumbling; its generating excite- 
ment and interest on campus," 
she said. 

The goal of the event is to 
"provide an awareness and 
appreciation for ihe richness of 
human cultural expression." 

The celebration will fea- 
ture both entertaining and edu- 
cational presentations on dance 
and music, as well as informa- 
tion about health and mental 
health issues offered from all 
cultural aspects. 

Representatives will share 
tables with many goups on 
campus, tentatively including 
Bangladesh Student 

Association, Women and 
Returning Adults, Hispanos 
Unidos. the Black Collegiate 
Caucus, Anthropology Club 
alone with others. 

IPFW Nursing department 
will also be available offering 
free blood pressure screenings. 

IPFW sophomore Liz 
Watson is a student in 
DiClemenli's Cross Cultural 
l\ydii&gt;kigy class. 

Watson researched the 
lopic of multicultural and cross 
culture studies when the discus- 
sion about planning a festival 
came up in class. 

She found that university 
campuses throughout the coun- 



try were participating in these 
kinds of activities. Watson 
thought why isn't IPFW doing 
Mimcllnng like this? 

"We're all human beings 
and we all have different beliefs 
that we should try to share with 
one another. I'd like lo see stu- 
dent cultures participate togeth- 
er, an expansion and mingling 
of cultures within the groups," 



dent from Cross Cultural 
Psychology, thinks Ihe festival 
is a great idea because IPFW 



2 enjoy food and 
It's a chance to 
sec what different organizations 
are about and experience other 
cultures," he said. 

Cross cultural students 
have also made available an 
open mic lo give people the 
opportunity to present with spo- 
ken word. An American Sign 
Language translator will also be 
attending for translation. 

Carpenter hopes that peo- 
ple will lake advantage of this 
and participate. 

The open mic will be 
available for any guests and pro- 
moters that would like lo share 
poetry, free style or simply 
speak their mind.

dents to log in to my.ipfw to

WebCT, OASIS, library servic-

whatever other computing 
services IPFW offers. 

The layout and certain 
options on the page are cus- 
tomizable, and will be updated 
to students' needs as the system 
is improved over the opening 
months. 

"Our attitude here is to do 
what we can, and to get it out as 
quickly as we can. and if it's 
not perfect; fix it — improve it, 
enhance it as we go along, but 
what we put out will work, 
(and) it doesn't quite reach our 
vision yet, but it'll be there," 
Franke said. 

Franke attributed the hard 
work designing and creating 
this portal lo over 30 people, 
including two vice chancellors. 

Administration and facul- 
ty from university relations, 
enrollment offices, IT Services, 
Helmke Library and others all 
chipped in on their own time. 

"We want (students) to be 
able to rely on it," Franke said. 
"It'll be one of the most mod-

"It was a great opportuni-

foot altitude of Pretoria. Wolf 
spent a week working with 
government officials, students 
and faculty members of the 
University of Pretoria. It was 
his first time in South Africa. 

Wolf said that students 
attending the university, which 
is comparable to a U.S. Ivy 
League school, were in the 
middle of final exams the 
week of his visit. However 
they showed strong interest in 
listening and watching the 
election results. 

He spent time speaking 
with them on several video 
conference calls both before 
and after the election. Wolf 
said that the listeners were all 
very engaged on issues and 
excited about the elections, 
asking questions about how 
the results would affect other 
aspects of U.S. government.

don't do something you create 
winners and losers," Wolf 

The hope behind the 
International Studies Program 
and the U.S. Embassy is to 
strengthen the ties with coun- 
tries like South Africa and the 
United States, by giving polit- 
ical issues a human face. 

During his time there. 
Wolf had also had the opportu- 
nity to experience a taste of 
local life. Following social 
customs, he tried some of the 
local food, including a meat- 
centered diet which included 
beef, impala and other game 
animals. He also visited a 
game park and saw a variety 
of animals in the wild includ- 
ing elephants, antelopes, zebra 
and giraffes. 

Wolf described Pretoria 
to be a provincial town, with a 
significant past. 

Considering the history 
of the country with decades of 
segregation and of social tur- 
moil surrounding it, South 
Africa has only in the last 15 
years embraced a more peace- 
ful transformation into a dem- 
ocratic system. 

Wolf strongly supports 
IPFW, in conjunction with IU 
International Studies, continu- 
ing to develop its newfound 
connections with South 
Africa. There are talks of mak- 
ing the trip a yearly event. 

"I'm hoping students and 
other professors will try and 
get involved, especially if we 
can set up some kind of 
exchange. It's really an amaz- 
ing place."

If s the Top 10 reasons 
why commuting sucks 



Every day that I have 
class. I go through the monoto- 
nous drudgery of commuting to 
IPFW. It's bad enough I have to 
gel up before noon most days, 
and then I realize it's not the 
quick drive to the other side of 
town as it was in yesteryear 
hack in high school. 

I quickly figured out thai 
driving lo the Fort everyday is 
immensely becoming a cum- 
bersome activity. I have now 
compiled my own top-ten list as 
to why commuting is hell, and 
why there should be no such 
thing as a commuter college. 

10. When I wake up in the 
morning everyday for class, I 
realize that I have to spend an 
hour both ways driving to 
school everyday, eventually 
leading to those, "Ah shit, bed, 
school, bed, school, BED!" 

9. The disadvantage of not 
being within minutes of class. 
Now. everyone can choose to 
throw on, or keep on their paja- 
mas and go to class. The prob- 
lem is, with substantially less 
time available to get around in 
Ihc morning, commuters such 
as myself often find ihat option 

Keep in mind this is coming 
from a guy who takes just less 
than 30 minutes lo get ready. So 
you know that is pretty sad 
indeed. 

8. Eighth is. for me at 
least, that the driving itself can 
cause lethargy and lead to the 
eventual siesta during morning 
classes. I guess this isn't too 



ing itself. 3. Again the lime issue
