Local 

businesses 

provide 

student 

discounts 



by Mishanna Wood, 

News Editor 

The Indiana-Purdue Sludcnl 
Goseinmcnt Association (iPSGA) has 
ly.'l'un usnij] contracted sludcnl, faculty 
and staff discount cards For ihe past 
Iwo years. [PFW WAS usinp ihe Sludcnl 
Advantage Card, which offered its 
cardholders a variety of national dis- 
counts. IPFW's dispersal of Student 
Advantage Cards was discontinued in 
September because members of IPSO A 
fell that the tost of the card &lt;S20| was 
li»&gt; expensive for the amount of dis- 
counts available n hx-al landholders 
A person had lo sign up for ATST 

the card at no cost. In addition, there 
were only a small number of local busi- 
nesses lhal honored the card. Contracts 
between 1PSGA and local businesses 
concerning discounts were sent ou! in 
November. The contracts are valid until 
December 2002. 

'Students can still purchase 
Student Advantage online or through 
l College Club. Locally, wc Tell there 
weren't very many discounts available. 
Most of the Student Advantage dis- 
counts were for larcc national compa- 
nies and online businesses.' said Elena 
Vacearo. public relations chair of 










contracts from Arbys. Mavericks 
Hallys She intends on sending out 
another mailing of contracts by next 

The local businesses have been 
very happy, welcoming and interested. 
For example. C'innamnnster gave us 3 
ten percent discount." said Vaccaro. 
Vaecam will keep updated information 
about any new companies who have 
decided to provide discounts on the 
IPFW Bulletin Boards and the iPSGA 
website. In a couple weeks discount 
listings will be located at Lhc Wnlb 
Union Information Desk. The Gates 
Sports Center service desk and the 
information desk on in Kcttlcr Hall.

Student leaders question merits of Purdue's 
modification to non-discrimination code 



by Todd Hamm, 
Editor 



Purdue University's Jan. E modifica- 
tion to its non-discrimination section of the 
Student Code came under fire yesterday 
afternoon as members of the Senate Siudent 
Affairs committee met lo discuss the possi- 
ble implications of the modified code. 

"The policy has been weakened. 
There's actually fewer protections now." Jeff 
Sterling, United Socialities CEO and 
IPSGA Senate Pro-Temp said. "They 
extended the protections for sexual orienla- 
ion, then they turned right around and took 



diet 



ulofii. 
Sterling argued th 



: there 



the Code. "IPFW prohibits discrimination 
against any member of Ihe university com- 
munity on the basis of race, religion, color, 
sex. age. national origin or ancestry, marital 
status, parental status, sexual orientation, 
disability, or status as a disabled or Vietnam 
era veteran" creates what he called a set 
"laundry list" of categories that Purdue is 
responsible for protecting. 

Sterling said that the old wording, 
which reads "No qualified person will be 

any student or employee be subjected to dis- 
criminatory treatment or be excluded from 
participation in any education program or 
activity...," has nD boundaries on who is pro- 
tected. 

"Before they couldn't use any reason to 



■ Malm, 



Sterling noted that a portion of 
Purdue's modification to the Code entitled 
"Limitations of Remedies" makes Ihe "abili- 
ty to sue very hard." It docs so, he said, 
because persons described in Ihe section 
have lime limits in which they must file their 
complaints for them to be valid, have to file 
the complaints in Tippicanoe county, and can 
only sue for up to S25.0O0. which docs not 
include attorney fees and several other types 
of damages. 

"There's nothing like (his for the other 
categories. Under the old policy they didn't 
have these artificial limits. It's treating these 
three new areas as different." Sterling said. 



Sterling believed Ihat Purdue reworded 
the Code in order to "lessen their exposure." 
"From their angle, the less people (hey have 
to agree to protect, the less possibility they 
1 e sued or lo be wrong. From a 



'spointof view that's 






uent spointot view mat s a bad issue to take. 
There should be no discrimination period. 

Others at the meeting agreed with some 
of Sterling's statements. 

"I don't think that the administrators 
should go ahead with this without a ' 
knowing our viewpoint."

By instilling math confidence through careful,

qualities future educators arc trained in and doesn't

exploring the previous two questions. Her thorough-

The university and its students are doubly

The idea behind both bills is this: most news cov- standard to determine:

on increasing energy supply We arc told energy prices * Whether new power plan

gas wells, more electric poivcr plants, and more oil * The best location (or ncc&lt; 

It's like the only thing in our toolbox is a hammer, 
so we tteat everything like it's a nail. * Whether these plants arc : 

Yet in many cases, increasing the supply for one ernment. 
form of energy increases demand for another. For 
example, most new electric generating plants bum nat- 
ural gas. Currently. 8690 megawatts of additional 
power plants are approved or being reviewed in our 
slate. This figure represents -13 percent of Indiana's 
current power generaimn capacity, and is 5000 
megawatts mote than will be needed in Indiana by 
2005. as projected by the State Utility Forecasting 

Merchant plants use voluminous amounts of natu- 
ral gas. An 800 megawatt base load merchant plant 
would use as much natural gas as used in city of 
Indianapolis in one year. Merchant plants currently 
represent about 10 percent of the increase in demand 
for natural gas They also reduce summer storage 
reserves for winlcr heating. 

In other words, building more merchant plants 
could increase the cost of heating homes.

munity say they 



I indue

eof a 



sage. When Ihey make their broad 

talions of Dr. King's words. Ihey are sending 

a mixed message to today's youth. 

From the "us versus them" mentality of 
Reverend Jesse Jackson, to Ihc reverse dis- 
crimination and bigotry of Louis Farrokhan, 
today's youth are constantly placed in the 
middle of a battle between "the acceptance 
of the.r role in social diversity" and "the 
understanding of their own cultural integri- 
ty." You witness this in every quoie-unqunic 
-segregated" school lunch room-where 
dren of the same race and soeio-cco- 

"people like themselves.'* You witness Ihis 
on every television set-when you find the 
choices limited to "Friends" or 
"Moesha "You witness this on college cam- 
puses, where social openness and intellectu- 
al ctpansivcness are merely phrases 
engraved on a sidewalk or statue in front of 
an "a 1 1 -black" fraternity. There is no interac- 
lion-lhere is only co-existence. 

Dr. King speaks of a quality of one- 
ness. He slates in his famous "t Have A 
Dream" speech, "Let us not sec): to satisfy 
our Ihirsl foi freedom by drinking from the 
cup of bitterness and hatred'-speaking of 
"that day when all of God's children, black 
men and while men, Jews and Gentiles. 
Protestams and Catholics will ... join hands 
and sing ... 'Free at last! Free at last! Thank 
God Almighty, we are Iree at last''" Ycl.just 
a few years ago. a "million men" channeled 



their energies, stood in the shadow of ot 
nation's Capital and opened their minds an 
ears-only to hear the words of Louis 
Farrakhan, a man who characleri 
as the "blue-eyed devil" and Jews as "blood- 
suckers" with a "gutter religion." And 
tipper Gore is concerned about rap music''! 

What happened to Dr. King's message? 
Where are the ide-lh Of Sojourner Truth and 
Harriet Beechcr Slowc? Have the life-alter- 
ing accomplishments of the influential 
Blacks of (he past become simply that? The 
past? There are quite a few leaders who are 
quick to point fingers at the oppress™ 
the past-yet Ihc pendulum has shifted ftom 
one cittcme Io ihc other. The "o 
"equality" that lit King spoke t 
a need for balance. What purpose is served 
by pointing fingers then? Where's Ihe ' 
ance in that? 

All loo often, I hear people of CI

Often, these obstacles i

least able to make their homes more energy efficient. 
Low-income Jamihes often live in older, drafiier hous- 
es which arc poorly equipped to keep Ihe heat produced 
by propane, oil. electricity or natural gas. They can 
barely afford to pay their current energy bills, much less 
make investments to reduce future bills. 

This affects all of us. Many low-income families 
receive taxpayer- funded energy assistance to help them 
pay their bills If these homes are poorly insulated or 
have inefficient furnaces. We are spending more lax

The movie, as you can see. is difficult to summa- 
rize The plot is. as the movie's predecessors' plots: 
were, highly complex. And. like ils predecessors, in the 
end each story comes logelhci in a bloody showdown. 

The movie is not nearly as 
"Magnolia." It is on more of a "Pulp Fict 

Clearly "Pulp Fiction" inspired this movie. Then: 
are numerous similarities: Bolh involve eccentric 
lowlifes; both intertwine numerous interconnected 
crime stories; both have a character who knows how to 
deal with dead bodies (Mr Wolf in "Pulp Fiction" and 
Bullet Tooth Tony in "Snatch"!; bolh have scenes in 
which criminals allempl lo rob other criminals, but are 
talked out of doing so. bolh films have samurai swords 
which kill people; and both films involve jewels that are 
locked away in brief cases. 

"Snaich" however has a decidedly different, more 
dry sense of humor. Most of the jokes arc nol really loo 
obvious. There is plenty that I am leaving out here

Temptation Island' suitors lack sincerity

island in Beliri Their cipencnccs 
have been exploited every Wednesday 
on Foi at 1 p.m for the past month 

I was informed about this show 
through a friend. She seemed excited 
about the idea of four single couples 
"ci pen meriting" with others. She 
thought the eiperience of 
"Temptation Island" would be good 
and interesting for a relationship Her 
perspective was the only input I had

different sides of the island. Prior to

choose to view their significant oth- 



ers' dates and personal video mes-

At this pome, couples three and 
four seem to be doing quite well. 
They have been sending each other 
perianal messages as well as refusing 
to sec each other's dates. 

On the other hand. Ytossie and 
Tahecd started the visit off on the

exchanged harsh looks and unloving 
words TahccJ continued with their 
strained beginnings by refusing to 

Mandy and Billy started off 
" she gol a little too close to 
suitors. When Billy saw her 
actions onscreen he went to another 
woman's cabin to seek revenge. 

My View: Temptation Island' can be 
amusing at times, however, the end 
result is just pointless. 

The more 1 watch this show die 
worse it gels. It's just a bunch of 



wofihi 



beautiful young people, paiading 
around on a beach The idea behind 
Ihe show is a nice try but it just docs- 
Fust of all there are many fac- 
tors that affect the actions of the pco- 
pleon the island. They are evaluating 
the quality of their relationship in a

would act completely normal in front 
of Ihe eyes of millions.

a single country and Ihe most powerful country in 
ihe world electing a former male cheerleader as its

foreign policy? "00 Americans! Beat Saddam! 
Give me a Ui Give me an S! Give me an A!" 

Anyway, here is a deeper and truly much 
more important question: what exactly is the spons 

For sutlers, ihcrr is aritujhly tlitr mn-i yiUcii

around and then skipping a sin-game road trip his 
team was about in cmturk on in order to deal with

Then we have Ray Lewis. Super Bowl MVP 
and defensive anchor: of the champion Baltimore 
Ravens. This year the future Hall-of-Famer cele- 
brated a Super Bowl victory with sprays of cham- 
pagne, when only last year he watched his friends 
celebrate a Rams* Super Bowl victory with sprays 
orblood The '00 celebration left I no people dead, 
the most recent probably just left a lot of Giants 
wishing they were dead 

And how about my old pal. Ales Rodriguez, 
formerly of the Seattle Mariners? Formetly. It 
seems the Manners could not ptoduce the cash 
needed to keep a man as important as Rodricuc in 
rainy Seattle. Forget the pitiful millions they had to 
offer, Rodriguez decided ta move on to greener 
pa&gt;turcs-ahout a quarter of a billion dollars green- 
er, actually. I hope he only hits seven homeruns. Ihe 
greedy jerk. 

So what is the iporU world coming to7 I do

Every year more and more universities fci

middle school and YMCA summer leagues and all 
those wonderful "soccer moms and dads' 1 who beat 
other spectators lo death at their children's hockey 

Where has the trademark integrity and sports-

Perhaps my winds come 100 laic It seems the 
world of spurts long ago began this downward spi-

But I do happen lo have a few suggestions 

1) Make Kobe Bryant commit to the full '(to 
or no 'fro; that p.nheiic lull- Aim thing isjustpli 
annoying, 

2) Let's make baseball bearable again. Cul 
down that repetitive, endless season to something 
more manageable. Something like Ihe 16-game 
football season or maybe we could just ski ' 
regular season and playoffs and go straight 
World Series. That would be ptelty easy. We 
just have all Ihe team managers draw straws 
who gets to play against ihe Yankees 

3) Lei Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis fight 
already I want to see Tyson gel whupped up again. 

Well. Ihosc arc all of the ideas I have for the 
sports world. I tried lo think of some for the other 
areas of Ihe world, but everything seems preily
