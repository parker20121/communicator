IPFW p residenti al race begins 

Candidates 
compared 



MICHELE R. SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 
They both have served one term as 
student body president. And they both 
have been members of the university 
resource policy committee and the 
Student Union Board of Governors 
(SUBOG1 Both men are also brothers 
in the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity at 
EPFW 

The two men are Joe Motherwell, 
student body president, and Don 
Gorney, former student body 
president, and a current me ber of 
SUBOG. Both are competing in the 
race for student body president for the 
academic year 1986-87. 

"The number one piece of ex- 
perience that I have is my number of 
years (two) as a retail manager," said 
Motherwell in explaining why he would 
be a better candidate for president. 
"Plus, the past year I've been student 
body president." 

Motherwell was regional manager 
for a national clothing store, and also 
worked as a merchandise advisor for 
the same national chain. 

"I'm a full-time student and I was a 
full-lime president," said Gorney 
explaining why he would make a better 
president. "I'm on campus everyday 
and can be reached when needed. " 

Gorney continued to explain that 
probably his biggest achievement as 
student body president in the year 
1964-85 was to build a better repoire 
with other Indiana campuses, and the 
main campuses. "It just hadn't been 
done in the past," said Gorney. "We're 
all connected, and it's kind of silly for 
us not to work together." 

Gorney and Motherwell have equally 
long lists of achievements to their 
credit during their service to IPFW. 

Gorney has served on numerous 




committees, including the university 
resource policy committee, the sub- 
committee on athletics, the faculty- 
student affairs committee, the honors 
program council, and he has been a 
member of the board of directors for 
Indiana-Purdue University 
Newspapers, Inc. He is a current and 
former member of SUBOG, where he 
has chaired the social committee and 
the travel committee. Gorney joined 
SUBOG a year before he served as 
president. He also has extensive 
service on Student Senate to add to his 
list of credits. "I served on Student 
Senate for two years before I was 
president," said Gorney, "including 
president pro-tern, and chair of student 
affairs committee of constitutions and 
appropriations." 

Gorney is also a member of the 
Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, where, 
for the past year, he has served as 
president. "I'm in charge of a lot," 
said Gorney." I'm in charge of 
athletics and fund-raising." 

Motherwell, loo, has been on similar 
committees, and has been involved in 
like activities Motherwell has served 
on the Chancellor Search and Screen 
Committee, where he learned how the 
university works and more about the 
faculty attitudes. "I learned how Ihe 
university works, and (I learned) the 
attitudes of the faculty toward the 



"I learned how the university works, 
and the attitudes of the faculty toward 
the students..."

full-time president."

students and toward the ad- 
ministration," explained Motherwell. 
He has also served as a member of the 
Business Student Advisory Board, and 
a member of the 1966 "Leadership 
Fori Wayne" Program. He, like 
Gorney, has served on SUBOG, where 
he chaired the social committee, the 
Red Cross Blood Drive committee, and 
served as a member of the travel and 
cultural committees. 

During his involvement with Sigma 
Phi Epsilon, Motherwell served as 
chair of the social and fund-raising 
committees for that fraternity. 

Both candidates elaborated on their 
goals for the coming year, in recent 
interviews. 

"The first goal would be to have the 
student discount program expanded 
and have it available in August," said 
Gomey, who is the president who 
originated the student discount 
program. 

First on the agenda for Motherwell Is 
to expand the hours at the Multipur- 
pose Building. Currently, the building 
is open on weekdays and on Saturdays 
from 9 a.m. to noon. Motherwell has 
worked with the administration so that 
beginning next fall the hours of the 
building will be expanded, on a trial 
basis, to ensure that all students 
benefit from the activities funded 
through their activity fee they pay 




each semester. 

Both want to work on the com- 
munication between Students 
Government, the administration and 
the students. 

Motherwell's campaign brochure 
slates that one of his goals is to 
"continue the positive working 
relationship with campus ad- 
ministration." "Either we have a very 
cooperative chancellor's office or I've 
developed a good working relationship 
with them," said Motherwell, ex- 
plaining that when he requests a 
change and has a good argument to 
back up his request, "they usually say 

Gorney aims at building a similar 
working relationship with the new 
incoming chancellor "One goal would 
be lo have a good repoire with the 
incoming chancellor so he understands 
the student concernsof the campus." 

The other offices open that will be up 
for election are the office of student 
body vice president. Gina Kosloff, 
currently holding that position, Is the 
uncontested candidate for that office. 
She is Motherwell's running mate. The 
office for SUBOG chair is also up for a 
vote Elizabeth Schlueter and 
Meredith Williams are candidates for 
that office. In addition, all the seats on 
SUBOG and Student Senate are up for 
election. 



Kenworthy accepts position in Missouri 



By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 

On June 30, when O. Franklin 
Kenworthy leaves IPFW, this school 
will be losing one of its most diverse 
and involved leaders. 

Kenworthy, assistant vice chan- 
cellor and dean of academic services, 
will assume the position of dean of the 
College of Arts and Letters at South- 
western Missouri State University on 
Julyl. 

"The primary (job) is to get the 
college organization in place," Ken- 
worthy said of his new position. "It's 
probably not a lot different from (the 
School of) Science and Humanities 
when I was the first dean." 

Since 1967, Kenworthy has served 
IPFW in several areas. "Frank 
Kenworthy is a most unusual kind of 
person in that he has done so many 
things and done them well, ' ' said John 
Carnaghi, vice chancellor of financial 
affairs, of Kenworthy 's versatility. 

In the almost 20 years Kenworthy 
has been at IPFW, he has served in 
academic areas as well as ad- 
ministrative areas He began at IPFW 
in 1967 as an instructor of speech and 
theatre. Since then he has served as an 
assistant and associate professor in 
the same department, as well as full

professor and chairman of the 

department of theatre. 
David McCants, chairman of the 

department of communications and 

theatre, complimented Kenworthy's 



contributions to Purdue-Indiana 
Theatre (PIT). "I think one of the 
important characteristics of him as a 
teacher is that he carefully integrated 
the academic and the laboratory 
programs into the theatre," said 
McCants. He added that because 
Kenworthy has contributed so much to 
PIT, "we won't have the depth or the 
breadth in the future" because of his 
departure. "We won't have his ex- 
pertise," added McCants. 

Kenworthy's list of ac- 
complishments are not confined to the 
stage of PIT, however From 1976 to 
1977, he was acting dean of the School 
of Science and Humanities white the 
school was being organized. "I was its 
first administrator," said Kenworthy. 
"This organization included chairing 
the search for dean, establishing the 
relationship between the dean's office 
and the e'ejjartment chairpersons, 
guiding the academic implementation 
of the trustees' autonomy resolution, 
and assisting the faculty in creating 
by-laws for the school." 

Kenworthy has also worked as 
assistant dean of faculty, acting vice 
chancellor and dean of faculty. 

"We're just not going to find one 
person to replace Frank Kenworthy," 
said Carnaghi lauding his efforts at 



IPFW. 

"The versatility thing you just don't 
replace," continued Carnaghi, who has 
worked with Kenworthy at IPFW since 
1980. "You don't find (that) in any one 
person You get three or four persons 
to do the job." 

Kenworthy commented on the 
university he will be moving on to 
recently. Southwestern Missouri State 
University, located in Springfield, 
Missouri, originated in 1906 as a 
teaching institution. "Since then, "said 
Kenworthy, "it has broadened Its 
mission to (include) the liberal arts 
and sciences and professional 
education." The university, the second 
largest in the state, presently has an 
enrollment of 16,000 students. 

When asked what he will miss most 
about IPFW, Kenworthy had one 
answer "( I will miss) the people I've 
gotten to know over the years, 
clearly," said Kenworthy "You work 
to solve the things through the folks," 
he continued. "The people have been 
very, very good to work with." 

And it appears that Kenworthy will 
be missed by his colleagues here also. 
"We'll miss him qualitatively," said 
McCants. 

"He'll he sorely missed," added 
Carnaghi. 



Forensic team wins top honors 



By SCOTT L. NEUMAN 
Staff Writer 

The culmination of months of effort 
is approaching as the Indiana-Purdue 
Forensic League (I.PF.L) prepares 
to travel to Bloomsburg, Penn- 
sylvania, for a national competition 
beginning on April 22. 

IPFW will be only one of about 200 
colleges and universities that will be 
represented. 

The I.PF.L. competed in the 
Indiana State Individual Tournament 
in St. Mary-in-the- Woods, Indiana, 
during (he weekend of March 15 and 16. 
Those who placed in the state com- 
petition will be advancing to the 
National Forensics Association finals. 
Members of the I.PF.L. won many top 
honors, including first place awards in 
Informative Speaking, After-Dinner 
Speaking, Dramatic Duo, Prose, and 
Novice Prose. IPFW fared well 
against much larger schools in the 
state, among them, Indiana at 



Bloomington, Notre Dame, and Ball 
State 

Since the beginning of the first 
semester, orators from the I.P.F.L. 
have been giving up most of their 
weekends in order to travel and 
compete in Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, 
Ohio, and Wisconsin. Since many of the 
team members are employed, the 
rigorous schedule of competition 
would seem to present a potential 
problem. However, Vicki Karns, 
communications professor and 
director of the group says, 
"Employers are generally very un- 
derstanding and supportive because 
they realize that it is necessary for 
people to communicate effectively in 
the workplace." 

Karns, who is the third director of 
the Indiana-Purdue Forensic League 
in its six-year history, credits faculty 
dedication, Students Government, and 
individual team members for the 
success of the organization. Even 



though the various competitions take 
up a lot of time, Karns says to any 
potential members, "You can join and 
put in as much time as you want ." 

According to Karns, the goal at 
nationals is lo finish in the top ten 
percent in the I.P.F.L.'s division. She 
admits this will not be an easy task, 
but is confident that those competing 
will be prepared lo face the challenge 
As far as the group's overall goal, they 
would like to continue growing without 
losing ground in any area of com- 
petition. Karns says, "We've picked up 
three to four strong novices that have 
potential for next year. " 

The I.P.FL. will be holding a send- 
off for the national competition on 
April 21 at 7 p.m. in the Fairfield- 
Columbia Room, G2i of the Walb 
Memorial Union Building. The 
speakers going to the competition will 
be presenting their speeches. Anyone 
interested is encouraged to attend. 




Vlckl Karns, communications 
professor, is the director of the 
IPFW Forensic League. Members 
of the league who won the state 
competition will advance to the 
National Forensics Association 
finals (pholohy John Luckey).

Does anybody really 
know what time it is? 



Live pfwa) 

KETTL£R KAu 



Does anybody really know what time it 
is? 

If you're in Kettler Hall, you may 
never know. The clocks there can't seem 
to agree on what time it is. 

Sure, the clocks function. Most do, 
anyway. But just whose time do the 
clocks keep? On the first floor, the 
clocks, especially in the classroom 
corridors, appear to be in the Pacific 
time zone. The ground floor clocks are 
on Daylight Savings, and if you happen 
to be in the basement, you're probably 
right on time with the Japanese. 

With the clocks all reading so 
differently, it would be no wonder if 
students were consistently late to 
classes in Kettler Hall. However, most 
students are well aware of the time warp 
in that building and adjust to it by 
ignoring campus time and relying on 
their wrist watches. Timex could sure 
make a buck at IPFW ... all they need to 



do is set up a stand out front of Kettler 
and rake in the profits. 

There is a definite problem here and 
action needs to be taken. Most of the 
clocks work; the problem is correct 
time. With some, the only problem is the 
hour hand — the minute hand is correct. 

But it does seem as if IPFW isn't 
concerned with students attending 
class on time. Otherwise, the problem — 
which has existed for quite sometime — 
would have been solved long ago . but 
so would other student concerns like the 
parking problem, the selection of a new 
chancellor, and the creation of a new 
fine arts facility. 

If the campus can find the money to 
create the CAD-CAM institute, to 
sponsor seminars, and to build a new 
child care facility and a new animal care 
facility, then surely a few dollars could 
go to repair the clocks. 



Competition is virtually 
nil in student elections 



The best thing to keep a politician on 
his toes is competition. 

Unfortunately, with the Students' 
Government elections less than a week 
away, competition is absent in the 
student senate elections. Currently, 
there are only two people who has 
submitted their petitions to run for 
student body president. Those people are 
Joe Motherwell, the 'present student 
body president and Don Gorney, a 
former student body president. 

It is not Motherwell's fault that there 
are no opponents. He, his vice president, 
Gina Kostoff, and Acting Chancellor 
Edward Nicholson have all urged 
students to get involved in student 
senate. It is too bad that the majority of 
the students around here will not 
accept that challenge. Are you satisfied 
with letting others run your university 
and help make changes that could affect 
your studies at IPFW? 

Now, obviously, the main seat that is 
open is the one for student body 
president, fol lowed by the offi ce of 
slt(3eJtt£toodj r vice" ■ p'res ident" Certainly", 
we cannot expect students with no 
experience on Students* Government to 
run for president — although they are 
free to do so. 

Needless to say, once again the IPFW 
student body has stood idly by and let the 
opportunity to get involved slide by. Last 
year, the race for student body president 
was exciting, to say the least, with four 
men contending for that position. 



This is not to say Motherwell and 
Kostoff have not done their job. They 
are, by far, two of the best leaders this 
campus has seen in over two years. 
Motherwell has represented his 
constituents excellently through 
participation in the Search and Screen 
Committee for a new chancellor and 
through Leadership Fort Wayne, among 
other activities. Kostoff too, can also be 
commended for successfully completing 
the remainder of Brad Miller's term as 
student body vice president, after he left 
for a semester of study in Rotterdam, 
Netherlands. With only a year of 
experience on student senate, Kostoff 
has proven she has the leadership 
abilities and concern for students needed 
as a Students Government leader. 

In closing, for future advice, we'd like 
to encourage other students to get 
involved if they aren't already. Right 
now the only remaining way is to vote in 
next week's elections on Tuesday and 
Wednesday. And to those members 
presently on student senate: You can't 
be perfectly satisfied with every thing 
your student body president has done in 
the past year. He may be good, but he's 
not perfect. 

Certainly, there are a few of you who 
would have been qualified to run for 
president, but you did not. It is just too 
bad you could not have the courage or 
willingness to give these candidates the 
competition they deserve! 




Letters to the Editor 



Editor requests 
student writers 

TotheStudents: 

There is an excellent 
opportunity filled with ex- 
perience and recognition 
available to students right 
here at IPFW. This op- 
portunity is writing or being 
actively involved in the 
student newspaper. The 
Communicator. 

The newspaper offers 
students the chance to learn 
more about the campus and 
its functions. It provides the 
opportunity to improve your 
research and writing skills, 
which can be a benefit for 
obtaining any type of job. 

Employers today do not 
want students who have been 
"book worms" for four 
years, but students who have 



obtained a well-rounded 
education. Students who can 
communicate!! And what 
better chance to improve 
your communication skills 
then by writing for a large 
audience. 

While writing for The 
Communicator or being an 
editor on the staff, students 
can earn college credit The 
Communicator offers an 
internship in writing, W398 
(listed under English in the 
class schedule!, which can 
help you learn how to write 
for the newspaper_^or im- 
prove upon the "stalls you 
already possess. 

As a member of The 
Communicator staff for 
three years, I speak from 
experience Although I have 
made mistakes, I have 
learned valuable in- 



formation and I have gained 
experience that is 
irreplaceable. 

Several area professionals 
today were active members 
of The Communicator staff 
at one time. 

Such recognizable people 
as Marti Wright, anchor- 
reporter for WPTA channel 
21, and Reggie Hayes, sports 



reporter for the News 
Sentinel, have been staff 
members 

I am now encouraging you 
to take advantage of the 
opportunity and become an 
active member. You, too, 
can gain the experience that 
may be a key selling point in 
obtaining the job you desire.

The time is ripe to kick off scholarship fund-raising campaign 



ByBARTAKEY 
Sports Editor 
Well, here it is, that 
special time of year for 
college coaches and high 
school seniors. A time for 
many student athletes to 
make one of the biggest 
decisions of their young 
Hves. 



Commentary 



After all the recruiting, 

talking with parents, talking 
with coaches and visiting all 
the universities, it's time to 
make the big decision. Yes, 
that magic day, April 9, is 
almost upon us. The day the 
student athlete will sign-on 
with the college or university 
where he intends on spen- 
ding the next four years. 

So, you ask, what's this 
have to do with IPFW A 
school lhat is in the process 
of building and rebuilding its 
baskelball programs — and 
by no means a Division II 
powerhouse? A school whose 
athletic department has 
money for only one-third of 
the athletic scholarships it 
could give out according to 
NCAA rules. A school that, 
without a doubt, isn't buying 
new cars for its potential 
bluechippers. 



It has everything to do 
with IPFW! This university 
is, in fact, growing and so is 
its' athletic programs. And 
yes, it's basketball coaches 
do go after blue-chippers. 

Terri Lydy, a freshman 
from Heritage High School, 
is one example. With her 
record- setting season and 
being named GLVC 
Newcomer of the Year, it's 
hard not to classify her as a 
blue-chipper, a player who 
can turn a program around 

But this is a tough road for 
coaches Tim Russell and 
Julie Calahan. Many high 
school seniors in this 
basket ball- enriched area are 
heavily recruited, by both 
division I and division II 
powerhouses, in and out of 
this area. It is hard to 
compete with programs that 
not only offer potential 
recruits a free ride, with a 
winning program, but also a 
"free lunch." Most 17- and 
18-year-olds will take the 
money and run. And how do 
yoii compete with programs 
that offer national exposure? 
Yes, coaches at powerhouse 
universities do tell their 
potential recruits lhat their 
family and friends can 
watch them on TV every 
Thursday and Saturday. And 
to sweeten the pot even 
more, how about choice

housing, special tutors and a 
work study program, to keep 
money in their pockets. 

It sounds like our two floor 
generals are going into 
battle without any heavy 
artillery against the 
powerhouses in this 
recruiting war. How they 
continue to recruit quality 
student athletes is a 
mystery, but even more 
mysterious is the (act that 
they compete with, and beat, 
programs which use 100 
percent of the dollars 
allowed by the NCAA on 
athletic scholarships. Our 
hats off to the coaches and 
athletic department 

Although both Coach 
Russell and Coach Callahan 
had good recruiting years 
last year, one would have to 
say Coach Calahan had a 
banner year In just her first 
year at IPFW, she managed 
to recruit two of the finest 
high school seniors in the 
area. And now, with two 
student athletes graduating 
and one., possibly trans- 
ferring to another school, 
the search is on for yet more 
blue-chippers to replace the 
vacancies left in the roster 
It will be tough to top last 
year's recruiting, but even 
tougher to rep i ace the 
leadership you lose when 
seniors graduate. Good luck 



lo Coach Calahan. 

As for Coach Russell, he, I 
believe, will have a few

Hopefully he will do this with 
some of the many blue- 
chippers who showed us 
their moves in the recent 
IHSAA tournament. If you 
didn't see the DHSAA tour- 
nament, you missed some 
great talent. Talent which. is 
said to be the most sought 
after in the country. Sorry, 
Ohio and Illinois — you'll 
have to take a back seat. 

Regardless if Coach 
Russell lands a prize catch, 
he will be a force to be 
reckoned with. He proved 
last season his team could 
play with the best and with 
five soon-to-be seniors 
returning it spells trouble for 
GLVC opponents. 

So maybe now you have a 
little clearer picture of the 
problems faced by the IPFW 
athletic department and its 
coaches. Maybe you're 
saying to yourself, "So that's 
why we don't recruit the 
Walter Berrys and Cheryl 
Millers. We're not a 
powerhouse and we don't 
have the dollars." 

Ah, but wait a minute. It's 



the cavalry lo the rescue. 
Yes, the cavalry, in the form 
of the administrators and 
directors in the athletic 
department. From what I've 
gathered, they will

firms do look to this 
university for . potential

look too bad for them to 
support college athletics. As 
a mailer of fact, it makes 
Ihem look good. Since IPFW 
receives no athletic

either Indiana or Purdue 
Universities, what better

Consumers: kick the impulse buying habit 
and pick up traditional, thrifty values 



Bv JULIE MAGSAMEN 
Staif Writer 

You just couldn't resist. 
The sweater looked so good 
on the rack The colors 
would compliment your new 
suit perfectly (or so you 
hoped). Your credit card 
covered the purchase, and 
the sweater was thrown in 
the bag along with the other 
"too good to resist" items. 

When you got home, the 
sweater was stuffed in your 
drawer. It didn't really quite 
match anything you had, but 
you could always find some 
other bargain to pair it with 
later. 

Congratulations! You are 
an impulse buyer. But take 
heart, you are nol alone. 
About half of all consumer 
purchases are made on 
impulse Debtor's 

Anonymous, a support group 
for latent-impulse buyers, 
can give you tips to help curb 
that appetite for spending : 

1. Keep a shopping list 
with you at all times. Add to 
the list whenever you think 
of an item you need or a gift 

2. Keep a list of the sizes, 
likes and dislikes of the 
people for whom you shop. 

3. Carry a swatch of your 
drapery or carpet fabric if 
you are buying furniture. 

4. Plan to shop when you 
are not rushed. 

5. Don't put off buying 
important items until the 
last minute. 

6 Decide ahead of time the 
quality with which you will 
be most satisfied and the 
quality which you would be 
least satisfied with. 

7. Before going to the 
store, know how much you 
can afford to spend. 

8. Compare prices, 

9. Sleep on the decision, 
especially if you are making 
a large purchase. 

10. Don't be persuaded by 
a salesman's pitch that the 
item will only be on sale 
today. 



11. Keep your money in 
ha rd-to- rea e h pi ac es . 

Americans are regaining 
their old traditional values of 
Ihriftiness that have been 
lost in the last decade or so. 
People are more conscious 
of the value of the dollar. 
Consumers are buying fuel 
efficient cars and building 
homes (hat are built to be 
energy sufficient. 



■ Another way Americans 
have become thrifty is 
through coupon clipping. 
Smart shoppers save an 
average of $2.2 billion a 
year, the total retail value of 
coupons cashed in each year 
in the United States. Every 
year for the past four years, 
membership in the coupon- 
clipper club has risen almost 
15 percent. The average 
family is deluged with 1,500 



coupons a year and cashes in 
about five or more a week. 

Clipping coupons helps 
impulse buying by forcing 
the purchaser lo make out a 
list before shopping. Bar- 
bara Salsbury, author of 
"Supermarket Survival," 
advises the consumer to 
read advertisements very 
carefully. She advises the 
careful shopper to make 
their meal plan after reading 



the ads. This will help to 
incorporate many of the 
weekly specials into the 
menu instead of trying to 
find coupons to fit what has 
already been planned. 

When shopping, Iry to 
conduct it as a business 
instead of a pleasure trip. 
The more time spent inside 
stores usually results in 
more impulse buying for the 
shopper

Shows mimic hit sitcoms of the '70's 



By MARY HARMON 

Staff Writer 

Spring is once again in the 

air, and along wilh budding 

Commentary 

trees and blooming flowers, 
another annual event has 
occurred — the debut of 
television's mid-season 
replacement shows. With the 
success of series such as 
"The Cosby Show," and 
"The Golden Girls," 
situation comedies are the 
current "in" thing. 

Now 1 enjoy a good 
comedy as much as anyone, 
but a sampling of this 
spring's offering has left me 
longing for "I Love Lucy" 

" YOU AGAIN 
Veteran actor Jack 
Klugman is teamed up with 



teen-idol John Stamos in 
"You Again" on NBC 
Monday nights The series is 
about a teenage son who 
moves in with his divorced 
father after years of 
separation. As the title 
implies, father and son are 
not all that happy about their 
reunion. If you thought 
Archie Bunker and the 
Meathead were constantly 
feuding, then you ain't seen 
nothing yet. The hostilities 
erupting on this show make 
World War 11 look like a 
birthday party. 

In fact, the character _pf 

the smart-mouthed son is 
downright obnoxious. In one 
episode he callously drops 
the bomb on his father that 
he is going to marry his 
pregnant punk-rocker 
girlfriend The baby is not 
his however — a tiny detail 



he forgot the mention (o his 
frantic father, and the girl 
eventually returns to her 
former boyfriend 

PERFECT STRANGERS 

The odd couple theme is 
revisited in "Perfect 
Strangers," which airs 
Tuesdays on ABC. This show 
was somewhat pleasant to 
watch, yet it exhibits ab- 
solutely no originality. 

Mark Linn-Baker portrays 
a Chicagoan who's lifestyle 
is drastically changed when 
his Mediterranean cousin 
Balki i Bronson Pinchot I 
unexpectedly moves in. 
Balki is a sweet, naive 
foreigner much like the 
Latka character on Taxi. 
The show is billed as a 
cultural clash, but it is never 
made clear what country 
Latka — er ... I mean Balki, 
came from . 



This show could be en- 
tertaining if it focused on the 

differences in ideologies and 
customs of the two cousins. 

Instead, we are supposed 
to find amusement in Balki's 
incredible ignorance. 
Actually, it got a little old 
watching him discover color 
TVs and sofas thai convert 
into beds. It paled in com- 
parison lo the Beverly 
Hillbillies discovery of the 
"cement pond," or of the 
"mysterious bell" that rang 
when visitors were at the 

ALL IS FORGIVEN 
One new show that may 
survive is NBC's "All is 
Forgiven," which is featured 
on Saturday nighls. The 
show stars Bess Armstrong 
as a newly married woman 
thrown into the job of 
producing a struggling 



daytime soap opera. Despite 
the talented cast which also 
includes Carol Kane 
(Latka's wife.Simka), 1 was 
disappointed with the 
episodes thai I viewed. It 
just wasn't funny enough — 
Carol Kane had a few 
hilarious lines, and Bess 
Armstrong had a couple of 
amusing lines. The rest of 
the characters suffered from 
either being too serious, or 
from jokes that simply were 
not funny. 

Maybe I'm unreasonable, 
but I expected comedies to 
be humorous. If "All Is 
Forgiven" would inject 
more humor into its up- 
coming episodes, il could be 
thesmash hit of the season. 

The bottom line here is 
don't waste lime fantasizing 
about watching the new 
shows on TV — it's not worth 
the effort.

Owen a leader, MVP 



ByTONYDUNAWAY 
Stalf Writer 

Coach Amie Ball reflected 
that. "Ted Owens has been 
[he most improved player 
over such a short period of 
lime that 1 have ever known 
He has worked very hard on 
his game and especially in 
the physical development 
aspect." 

Owen's experience at 
volleyball was limited to his 
sophomore and junior years 
at Heritage High School. 
Owen played no volleyball in 
his senior year at Heritage 
nor did he participate during 
his freshman year at Tri- 
StateCollege at Angola. 

Currently in his junior 
year of eligibility with the 
Volleydons, Owen, a middJe- 
hitler, says "Coach Ball 
makes the gome fun. He has 
also brought national 
recognition to IPFW and he 
is greatly respected." 



Coach Ball describes 

Owen as "very Intense He 
lakes the game seriously. 
Ted is also polite and 
likeable. He is looked up to 
as a team leader " 

Owen has compiled some 
impressive credentials as 
reward for his determination 
and hard work. In 1985, he 
was the team MVP. and this 
season leads the Volleydons 
in blocks, in kills per- 
centage, is second in number 
of kills, and is second in digs, 
which is an area of the game 
that Coach Ball feels Owen 
has made one of his greatest 
improvements. 

An Electrical Engineering 
Technology major, Owen 
feels that his classes and 
volleyball are both very 
demanding. "When I 
graduate. I would like to 
continue to play volleyball, 
maybe in the United Stales 
Volleyball Association,"

Volleydons lose second 
match to Ball State 

ByBARTAKEY 
Sports Editor 

Last week the IPFW men's volleyball team lost to rival 
Ball State in Muncie. The Volleydons led the first match 8-2 
at one point before the Cardinals rallied to take the lead, 8-10. 
The Volleydons never got back on track and lost 10-15. 

In the second game, Ball State rolled over the Volleydons 2- 
'5. Coach Amie Ball commented, "We were never in that 

The third and final game of the match saw the Volleydons 
jump out to a 5-0 and then 7-2 lead. "We became very ten- 
tative at that point," Coach Ball said. "I was disappointed in 

the way we played." The Volleydons then lost the game 10-15 

and the match 3 games to 0.

The IPFW baseball team 
returns to the friendly 
confines of the IPFW 
diamond Friday when they 
entertain St. Joseph's 
College in a 1 p.m. double 
header. The Mastodons were 
2-6 when The Communicator 
went to press with road 
games scheduled for 



Wednesday at Ashland and 
for Friday at Huntington. 
LPFW's two victories came 
in a double header sweep of 
Division I opponent Butler 
University last week. 
SOFTBALL 
The IPFW women's soft- 
ball team got off to an 0-2 
start after dropping a pair of 
games to St. Francis a week 
ago. The Lady Dons hadn't 



been able lo practice outside 
when they met the Cougars 
and that showed as St. 
Francis won the opener 11-1. 
IPFW came back to take an 
early 2-0 advantage in the 
second game before falling 
6-2. The weather has been 
the victor in the last couple 
of scheduled match-ups. The 
women will host Huntington
