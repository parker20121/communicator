THE MYSTERIOUS AMERICAN DISEASE 



by Sandy Bradway 

Wednesday, April 29, it was announced that the 
United States would push into Cambodia to give 
support to South Vietnamese in a major attack on 
C^nmunist operating in Cambodia. Because of this 
announcement nximerous demonstrations have taken 
place on many of the country's college campuseSo 
The worst of these being at ^ent State where four 
students were killed when National Guardsmen open- 
ed fire on a crowd _pf s tudentso 

There has been much controversy on President 
Nixon's decision to move into Cembodla, and as 
usual in the '*free'* country of ours, everyone is 
entitled to their own opiniono Well, it seems 
that four peoples' opinions didn't matfcero 

And what are we, the students and administra- 
tion of T.U.-P.U. doing? Fighting over whether 
our flag should be flown at halfmast. The reason 
to fly the flag at halfmast was a very good one» 
We wanted to show that we were mourning the stu- 
dents that were killed at Kent State. But the 
pettyness of the administration and certain stu- 
dents disagreeing on whether the flag should be 
at halfmast, completely ruined the cause. People 
are dying in our country, Vietnam and now Cambo- 
dia. What do we do--fight about whether we shouM 
fly our flag at halfmast. I should hope that we, 
as so-called adults, can do more than that and do 
It peacefullyo

TO THE EDITOR: / 

As one of the harsh- 
est critics of the stu- 
dent newspaper this 
year( I once burned one 
in protest), I would 
like to say that in the 
last few weeks the news 
paper has been doing 
rather a good job. In 
point of fact, your May 
1st issue was an excel- 
lent example of the type 
of reporting that a cai» 
pus paper should con- 
cern itself with. Al- 
though there have been 
a number of typing 
errors, the newspaper 
in these last issues 
has been trying to re- 
port campus news to the 
student body. It has 
done a better job than 
any newspaper that I 
have seen in the last 
three years at this 
campus. Therefore, I 
hope that the Publica- 
tions Board will reap- 
point the present edi- 
tor for next year.

BOLINGER... 
A MAN ON THE 
GO 

by Teresa Larson 

James Bolinger, who is now ser- 
ving as Coordinator of Student Ac- 
tivities on this campus received his 
B. A. in psychology in 1966 from 
Northern University. He worked in 
vocational rehabilitation in Detroit 
his first year, in Tiffin, Ohio, for 
about six months, and in Chicago 
for about fourteen months. He 
heard about his present job from a 
friend he was working with at a 
summer agency who had held the 
pbsitioiTtwo years ago. At the^re- 
sent time he is also working towar ds 
his Masters Degree in psychology at 
St. Francis College. 

Mr. Bolinger resides in Fort 
Wayne with his wife, Judy, and 
his three and a half year-old son, 
David. Basketball, softbaU-really 
all sports-interest him. 

He enjoys working with college 
students and feels that this campus 
has "great potential for growth." 
One of his goals is to strengthen the 
Greek system at lU-Purdue. The 
other one, which is in the planning 
stages, is to have a regional campus 
athletic conference among the 
state universities besides starting 
intramural sports for girls and possi- 
bly intercollegiate sports such as 
tennis and cross country.

''WALK" 
Makes It 



More than 1,200 people from 
the Fort Wayne area took part in 
the "Walk for Development" spon- 
sored by the American Freedom 
from Hunger Foundation 

The walkers left from Zoliner 
Stadium at 9:30 a.m. Sunday and 
proceeded to cover the 24 mile 
route. Of those that managed to 
last throughout the entire walk, 
many were limping from their tired 
legs or complaining about their sun- 
burn. The youngest of the walkers 
was only 1 1 years old, and the Old- 
est was Sister M. Maris, who listed 
her age as "50 plus." 

It is not known at this time how 
much money was obtained in the 
form of pledges, but it is estimated 
that it cuuld total as much as 
$15,000. 



Students wishing to apply for a 
Rhodes of Marshall Scholarship are 
reminded that the deadlines for 
appUcations are early next fall.; 
Marshall, October 22, and Rhodes, 
October 31. Since these deadlines 
are early, Professor A. Rolfs, Pur- 
due representative for national 
graduate fellowships, suggest that

The Threat of Impatience 

A fundamental threat to the survival of the university is impatience. 
While destructiveness is limited to a very small number, and while 
romantic visions of the university as a misty community without form 
or authority are confined to a minority, impatience is pervasive. 

One target of impatience is inaction. Its stimulus is the daily intimacy 
with the horrors of war, poverty, violence, and oppression — all brought 
into the parlor on the television screen. 

Another target of impatience is complexity. Hate and love seem so 
simple, so obvious and direct. Yet the structures of a technological 
society and its government seem hopelessly complicated, beyond the 
reach of most, seemingly unmanageable even to the few who do grasp 
ihe levers of power. 

A third target of impatience is doubt. With a world to be saved, or 
simply a life to be lived, there is an overpowering urge to insulate 
yourself from the nagging, nibbling doubts which seem to spoil every 
confident hope and tarnish even the most ecstatic dream. Dogmatic 
assertion is a great relief. To some, blind fanaticism is "beautiful." 

Patience, we urge, but patience without purpose is boredom. So 
"relevance" becomes the slogan of an impatient generation. Their plea 
is for rclea.sc from the tedium of learning without purpose. 

Better they should cry "significance," for the crisis of purpose tran- 
scends topical problems. Today's problem could be "solved," and still 
the vacuum of purpose would sap the patience which learning requires. 

I do think we should be more forthcoming in our admission of the 
weaknesses and contradictions in our university inheritance. We should 
recognize and admit that the university is not for all people, nor for 
most people at all times of their lives. It is not even the only or, for 
many, even the best circumstance for learning. Action, too, has its claim 
as a teacher of wisdom. Capacity can be extended and enlarged by 
doing as well as by thinking. 

Wc should recognize also that, as knowledge does become more 
relevant to operational decisions, universities do have an increasing 
professional and clinical function, for the potential operator as well as 
for the scholar. The applications of learning once associated primarily 
with law and medicine and engineering must spawn analogous applied 
sciences in social and environmental studies. 

Most of all, we should admit that not all scholarship and learning 
are equally significant. The quality of intellectual excitement depends 
on whether the scholar is truly opening a new perspective or is simply 
accumulating data which do not themselves contribute to understanding. 
Definitiveness should not excuse the want of significance. 

We must even admit that reason is not the only clue to truth. 
Intuition and creative imagination have their role in perception as well 
as in expression, in learning as well as in life. Not all that is perceived 
can be analyzed, let alone weighed or measured. Not all that is worth 
expressing can be "programmed." Not all that is "true" can be proved 
by objective evidence. 

Wc should admit all this. Wc should leave room for — we should 
positively encourage — intuition, imagination, and the affirmation of 
revealed truth, even within the academy. We can acknowledge all these 
things, hut we must continue to assert that impetuous action, conscious 
oversimplification, refusal to doubt, and the rejection of reason are 
enemies of the university.

Swinging - Hoosiers Are Back ! 



Ten thousand miles, 
twenty-nine days, foui&gt;- 
teen weary students, 
one haggard faculty 
member, and a million 
happy memories made up 
nso Tour GA616. When 
the tour left Port 
V/ayne we could hardly 
believe that all the 
rehearsals, passport ap&gt;- 
plications and tetanus 
shots were finally over 
and we were on our way. 
Twenty-six long hours 
after leaving Port 
Wayne we arrived in 
Thule, Greenland. The 
eight girls on the toup 
have probably never had 
so much attention in 
their lives. In 
Greenland there is a 
saying thai; there is a 
girl i^ehind every tree. 
The only catch is that 
there are no trees in 
Greenland. 

At every station 
we were warmly greeted 
and well received. We 
sang thirty performan- 
ces for audl'inces rang- 
ing in size from ?$ at 
a remote radar site in 
Greenland to 500 in the 
base theater at Kef- 
lavik, Iceland, In 
addition to our club 
and theater perforroan- 
ces we also sang five 
programs at the depen- 
dent schools located 
at the large bases in 
Labrador, Newfoundland, 
and Iceland. 

The tour was certain- 
ly not all worko There 
was lots of time for 
playing tourist. Tom 
Stucky fished in Mew- 
foundland, Jeanne Hoff- 
man and Dave Kuebler 



shopped everywhere, 
"Doc" Harper collected 
rocks and lava, Char- 
lene Post danced, and 
eight of us sent swim- 
.ming in the outdoor 
polls in Reyjavik, ; 

What were the high- 
lights of the Tour? How 
can one explain the 
many experiences that 
were ours? To some it, 
may have been singing 
in the Catholic and 
Protestant Chapel ser- 
vices on Easter Sunday. 
Our choir was composed 
of military and civi- 
lian personnel and se- 
veral of the Danish 
civilians from Dundas 
Village. To others the 
highlight may have been 
the professional demand 
required of all of us. 
The rugged beauty of tl» 
polar ice cap and the 
icebergs or the first 
time we saw open water 
in Labrador may have 
been the memorable time 
for some. To all of us 
I am sure that there is 
a deep sense of grati- 
tude that you, through 
United Community Ser- 
vices, helped send us 
and that we are a part 
of a Univeriity that 
will allow us to parti- 
cipate^ in such an expei* 
ience. It is difficult 
to express the feelings 
and relationships expei** 
ienced on such tour. As 
director of the group 
I can only say that we 
represented our univer- 
sity well and I feel 
sure that each of us 
would welcome the 
opportunity to make a- 
nother tour if we 
should be chosen again. 



THANK YOU 
STUDENTS ! 



From responses that 
I have received. Earth 
Day-April 22. 1970-was 
a success. When asked 
if we would do it agairj 
there was a resounding 
"yes"; and due to this 
response, a student En- 
vironmental Organiza- 
tion is being formed 
here on campus just to 
illustrate that our ef- 
forts would not cease 
on April 23. 

The success of this 
effort is attributed to 
the countless number of 
students who partici- 
pated in Earth Day ac- 
tivities. Granted, 
there were specific 
committees of people 
who worked from the 
very beginning of the 
preparation. However, 
there is a vast number 
of students who gave 
assistance that did not 
receive recognition for 
their efforts, 

I stated many times 
during the past few 
weeks that I have never 
seen an organization 
working toward a goal 
on this campus receive 
as much responsible 
cooperation from every 
student as this coali- 
tion did. For this I 
am pleased and proud of 
my fellow students, A 
sincere note of thanks 
is to be given to this 
student body that cer- 
tainly demonstrated an 
attack against apathy 
that we have so often 
been accused of.

VIEWS OF THE NEW 



by Sandy Bradway 

The elections are over, the drama 
of who will win is now forgotten, 
and anticipation fills the air as this 
new Senate goes into office. When 
talking to the new Student Govern- 
ment members today, I noticed 
an ambitious and anxious attitude 
amonq all the new members. They 
seem to be eager and ready to take 
over their new jobs and responsi- 
bilities. 

The new Student Body President, 
Scott GilUe, is a junior at lU ma- 
joring in Sociology. He has no pre- 
vious experience in Student Govern- 
ment, but said he is ready to get 
down to work and learn. He said , 
. thattheinitialrelief of having won « 
is wearing off as he realizes the 
work that has to be done. He also 
said that one of the main things_ 
they wanted to do was build a bet- 
ter'Tine of communication withthe 
students. They would like to do 
this through personal contact, va- 
rious publications, and speeches,to 
let the students know what is going 
on in Student Government.He said 
he feels they have an ambitious plat- 
form, a nd a lot of work to do . 

Kent Stier, our new Student 
Body Vice-Piesident, . a junior at 
lU majo ring in So ciology.His reac- 
tion to his party's victory 
was that they have a lot of work 
Jhead of them. He said they would 
take action against paid 
parking and do everything they 
could to tight It. hie saia tfiey wul 
maintain contact with the students 
personally, and make the minutes 
of all their meetings readily avail- 
able to the students. 

The newly elected student sen- _ 
ators had this to say: Jim 
Hultiquist a sophomore majoring in 
secondary education at lU, said 
that he was very happy and elated 



that the party made such a clean 
sweep. He said they would work 
to see the activity fee lowered. and 
he would like to see the money 
being spent' itimized so they would 
know exactly where it is going and 
how it is being spent. 

Tom Newman, a student senator 
from last term, is a sophomore maj- 
oring in business administration at 
lU. He said he would like to see 
paid parking stopped, and a joint 
government of faculty, adminis- 
tration, and students started here 
on campus. 

Karen Nill, a junior at lU maj- 
oring in history, said she was very 
« happy her party won. She said she 
wanted to see some form of def- 
inite communication between the 
senate and the students started. 

Hal Meyers, a junior at lU maj- 
oring in Sociology, said that he had 
"mixed emotions" when he heard 
of the PSA victory. First of all, 
he feels that the students in the 
PSA party are "conscientous stu- 
dents" with "admirable goals" but 
that the problems of student go- 
vernment are not solved by the 
elections because the inconsidera- 
tion of administrative decisions 
still exists. A. id until students^ u- 
nify into a bloc as the administra- 
tion has, "it is meaningless to talk 
about such things as a campus 
parliament." 

Bernice Dammeyer, a Freshman 
majoring in Medical Records at lU, 
was a Student Senator this past 
term. She said she was very glad 
that they won, and that this new 
party will be able to do something 
for the school, as the others have 
previously said. She also would 
like to see a better line of commu- 
nication between the students and 
the senate so that they will know 



what the students want, ..She also 
said this term she would like to 
work on more committees, and she 
would like to work to do away with 
paid parking. 

Bonnie Bunch, a Sophomore ma- 
joring in Special Education at lU, 
said that she was surprised that 
she won, but she had a lot to learn 
and a lot of work to do now. She 
said she would like to see the Senate 
as a "go-between" for the students 
and the administration. She said 
there are a lot of things on the 
platform she would like to see get 
done, and she would work to see 
these things get done. 

Gary McOmber said he was sur- 
prised his party made such a clean 
sweep but was glad of the fact. He 
is a freshman majoring in engineer- 
ing at Purdue. He said that he 
would like to see more students in- 
volvement and more things done 
for the students. 

Kathy Clevenger, a freshman ma- 
joring in Math at Purdue, said she 
had a lot of confidence in the 
party and was sure they would 
win. The main thing to get ac- 
complished this year, according to 
her, is to get the money situation 
straightened out. 

Paul Pratico said he would like 
to help develop a more active stu- 
dent body, and be able to go back 
to the students to find out what 
they thing and want. He said he 
would also like to establish a feel- 
ing of participation for the night- 
time students, faul is a Sophomore 
majoring in Sociology at lU. 

Kathy Knopp, a Freshman at Pur- 
due majoring in Pharmacy, was e- 
lated that their party had won the 
elections. She said, as others have, 
more student involvement and bet- 
ter communications between the 
Cont, on pgo 9 



Gov» Members: 

Cont, from p^, 8 
students and Student Government 
are needed. According to her if the 
students were better informed, 
there would be so much more that 
could be done. 

"We intend to try to hold up the 
platform" was a statement made by 
Bea Chipko, a junior majoring in 
Theater at Purdue. She also said 
that they intend to try to repre- 
sent all students. 

Stan Giant feels it is great that 
the party won as a whole. He is a 
Freshman majoring in engineering 
at Purdue. He said he would like to 
see the PSA platform fulfilled, and 
better student participation on the 

different projects. 

"I was totally amazed at the 
whole party winning" was the reac- 
tion from Dianne Fridley, a junior 
majoring in Theater at Purdue. 
She said she would like to see the 
administration asking for the stu- 
dents' advice, and the "mickey 
mouse" in Student Government 
substantially reduced.

Violence 



Results-- 

As a result of the 
violence that broke out 
at the April 13th and 
17th dances the follow- 
ing four suggestions 
were made at a meeting 
headed by Dean Manges: 
1) To have more out- 
side police with the 
university security 
officer presiding 
over themo 2) Lock- 
ing off the gates in 
the hallways so the 
whole building would 
not be open. 3) Not 
to sponsor the dances 
directly to High 
school students. I4.) 
The organizntion 
sDonsoring the dance 
would have to pay 



for any damage up to 

a certain amount of 

money. 

These suggestions wHL 
be looked into and sane 
kind of policy formed 
to see that the disturb- 
ances do not occur 
again.

Paid Faiking FzDgram-In Effect 
SEPTEMBER !l! 



The Purdue Urx ^^er- 
slty Board of Trustees 
Thursday (April 30) ap- 
proved self-supporting 
parking for the Indiana 
Purdue University Cam- 
pue at Port Wayne o 

The new paid parking 
program for students 
and faculty vill go in- 
to effect in September* 
The Port Wayne Campus 
is the last of Purdue *s 
five campuses to come 
under a self-supporting 
program. 

The new program will 
operate under policies 
and a fee schedule a- 
dopted in June, 1967, 
when the Purdue North 
Central, Calumet, and 
Indianapolis campuses 
to come under a self- 
supporting parking at 
the Lafayette Campus 
has been in effect 
since 1963. 

The program at Port 
Wayne was approved by 
the Indiana University 
Board of Trustees in 
session last week in 
Blooming ton. 

The new program pro- 
vides some area for 
free parking. This 
feature was part of a 
five-point recommenda- 
tion of a special fac- 
ulty-student parking 
problem committee at 

the Port Wayne Campus 
which studiea -cne cam- 
pus parking problem for 
five months. The rew- 
ommendations were sub- 
mitted by Port Wayne 
Chancellor Ralph E, 



Broyles, Indiana, ana 
Dean and Director Law- 
rence 0, Nelson, Purdue 
to the universities' 
two presidents, Freder- 
ick L, Hovde and Joseph 
L. Sutton* 

Only one of the five 
recommendations— to re- 
quest state funds for 
future parking needs— 
was eliminated from the 
recommendations submit- 
ted to the two boards 
of trustees. 

The Port Wayne Cam- 
pus now has l,9ol park- 
ing spaces, but projec- 
tions indicate need for 
nearly 5,000 by I960 
when the campus is ex- 
pected to enroll nearly 
9,500 full and part- 
time students. Like 
Purdue's other regional 
campuses. Port Wayne is 
primarily a "commuter 
campus," 

Under the program, 
faculty and staff may 
obtain "A" spaces, con- 
sidered the most con- 
venient or desirable, 
at #30 per semester or 
|60 per year, and "B" 
spaces which will cost 
12.50 per semester or 
$25 per year. Students 
taking five to eight 
credit hours and fac- 
ulty and staff employed 
less than half time may 
obtain an "A" permit at 
$15 per semester or $30 
per year, or a "B" Per- 
mit at 16.25 per sem- 
ester or $12.50 per 
year. Students en- 
rolled in, or staff as- 



signed to, one to four 
credit hours may elect 
to take the same plan 
as prevails for rive \^u 
eight credit hours or 
they may use visitor 
parking meters on a 
daj;;^to-day basis* 

Visitor parking ar- 
eas will be metered. 
Under university park- 
ing regulations, park- 
ing permits at the Port 
Wayne Campus are valid 
at all other Purdue 
campuses. 

The work of the spe- 
cial Port Wa3me Campus 
faculty-student parking 
committee which pre- 
pared the original re- 
port to the two Fort 
Wayne deans won high 
praise from Dr. C. H. 
Law she, vice president 
for regional campus ad- 
ministration, 

"The final report of 
this committee is a 
classical example of 
student and faculty in- 
put into the operation 
of a university," 
Lawshe told the board, 
"We are extremely 
grateful for the many 
hours this group put in 
in the development of 
the program and its re- 
commendations. Though 
not every recommenda- 
tion was followed, 
this program is basic- 
ally the proruct of 
students and faculty 
working hand- in-hand 
with the administration 
to solve an important 
and basic problem,"

here's what you said I 



Tuesday morning the, 
flag was lowered tol 
half-mast for the four 
students that died at 
Kent State Monday. The 
flag was then raised in 
the afternoon because 
of technicalities. And 
now it's raised again. 
So the question appro- 
priate for this time 
is: "Do you think we as 
a University, should 
sympathize with Kent 
University students by 
lowering our flag half- 
mast?" 

Steve 5alisbury -As a 
University, It is not 
our right to say that 
every member of the 
University agrees with 
position taken by our 
new liberal student 
government, Indivuals 
have every right to 
their own private be- 
liefs, but here at this 
campus the placing of 
the flag at half-mast 
woiild not T^epresent the 
maiority. 

Karen Will -Yes I be- 
lieve the flag should 
be lowered in sympathy 
for the four students 
who lost their lives at 
the hands of the merci- 
less National Guard. 
There is no reason that 
the guard should ever 
be on a college campus, 
and the least that the 
students at Tndiana- 
Purdue can do is to fly 
their flag at hnlf-mast

Jim Reahm -De finitely I ' 
No matter what a per- 
son's politics are 
there was no reason for 
killing. Somebody died 
in an act of dissent 
and an investigation 
into this matter should 
be undertaken to pre- 
vent any further vio- 
lence. 

Steve Petty.iohn -I think 
that we are not only in 
mourning for those who 
died at Kent State, but 
for the 14.0,000+ Ameri- 
cans who have died and 
will die in Indochina, 
In short, I am in mourn- 
ing for the United 
States of America and 
the ideals it used to re- 
present. America is 
being divided into two 
camps: and as Abraham 
Lincoln said over one 
hundred years ago this 
country cannot survive 
if it is divided, 
Hal Myer s-Students were 
murdered by National 
Guardsmen, I say "Mur- 
dered" because the four 
students were not act- 
ing in such a way that 
the killings would not 
be construed as self- 
defense. V/henever 
troops come into a cam- 
pus and murder student, 
the whole question of 
lowering the flag ia 
rather ridiculous. To 
me it's no question- 
hell yes, we should 
.low er the flag I

The theme of the dance, 
"Muse", was carried out 
in three shades of pink 
aluminum paper along

veiled at Kokomo re- 
cently.

LEHMAN levcals 
VIEWS 

A familiar si^-ht (if 
you haunt the Bursar's 
office) is Mr. Iveg 
Lehman , Bursar for Pur- 
due at this campus. He 
is a 1969 graduate of 
lU-Fto Wayne, and has 
a Bachelor's Degree in 
Management Administra- 
tion. After graduating- 
from TU he immediately 
accepted the job as 
Bursar at Purdue, and 
has become an indispc- 
sable fixture. 

Kr. Lebunan's job is 
varied and interesting. 
Among other thin-^-s he 
collects Student Pee 
income, provides finan- 
cial management of Stu- 
dent Activities ac- 
counts, assists Stu- 
dent organizations in 
securing contracts, and 
last but certainly not 
least, collects con- 
tinuing education feeso 
His main reason loi 
accepting *— ^ job o^ 
Bursar was that he '^wan- 
ted to work Wath people 
more or less my own a'-e, 
which would be the stu- 
dent population." He 
feels that being close 
to the a.p,e of the stu- 
dents, he can under- 
stand their problems. 
One of his main goals 
is to " try and solve 
these problems in the 
realm of the administra- 
tive framework."

cont'd from p^;.6 
muster up enougn courage 
to pass this." 

Senator Tom Newman 
felt that the resolution 
would be no more good 
than the man in the 
moon." If we give ac- 
tive support it would 
mean a lot more. I»m 
not sure if there will 
be any difference if we 
give the Student Body a 
resolution or not", ad- 
ded Mr, Newman. 
^ Mr, Myers went on, 
' the ru assembly called 
for a strike and many 
Universities have shut 
down. This is our 
first meetings and we're 
sticking our necks out. 
Will we say the Teach — 
In is a good idea? I 
think we should." 

Mr. Newman then in- 
terjected the idea of a 
student strike. There 
was a little bit of dis- 
cussion on this but 
talk returned to tte 
resolution at hand, 
^V. Myers said, "Are we 
to be the out hous' in 
the back yard or the 
vanguard, initiating 
change? If we back 
down on this small of a 
thing, then thei*e is no 
hope of getting any- 
thing done. The eyes 
of the Haculty are upon 
us." 

Senator ^ewmanfelt 
that, "if we try some- 
thing we might as well 
go all out. This way 
we* 11 win the students," 

A roll call vote was 
called for by ^ent Stierc 
^irst Senator Myers 
moved that the resolu- 
tion be accepted and 
then the vote pro- 
ceeded. The vote was 
unanimously in favor of 
the resolution, 

Tom Newman moved to 



call for a Student 
strike of classes 
Thursday. He added, 
"We won the elections. 
People wanted liberals 
in. We had better give 
them more than the 
Micky Mouse they got 
last sermester'. If we 
don't pass something 
liberal now we'll shoot 
our wad." He also said, 
"We have the followers 
so lets lead the follow- 
ers," 

Senator Gary McUmber 
called the previous 
question but it was de- 
feated and discussion 
continued. 

Mr, Newman then am- 
mended his motion to 
read Friday instead of 
Thursday. The previous 
question was called 
again. Voting on the 
motion was 1-yes, 11-no, 
and 1-abstention, 

Senator Myers made 
the statement that "we 
have set a general di- 
rection of why we are 
here, who we are here 
for, -^t is time to 
talk a bout this direc- 
tjon — -it should havei 
been talked a bout be- 
fore we got here," 

Senator Newman said, 
"The trend has already 
been set," 

At this time presi- 
dent Scott Gillie in- 
terjected, "At this 
time Student Senate has 
to look at themselves 
and see if they'll be 
leaders or reflect 0- 
p in ions of the students. 
If this is the case 
there is no need for 
the Student Senate, We 
will have to say — "You 
elected us — you im- 
peach usl" 

The motion to ad- 
journ was made at 10-30 
p.m.

examines the latent sa- 
dism and confuse 1^ sexu- 
ality that are the re- 
sult of a repressive 
educational system. 

Vincent Canby of the 
New York Times called 
the film"a very austere, 
very composed and, in a 
barren sort of way, a 
quite beautiful movie 
about the cruelty of max, 
Volker Schlondorff has 
directed it with such 
understated control of 
time, place and people, 
that it has about it a 
kind of classic purity.'

AEK is at it again—

They succeeded in get- 
ting their queen candi-

the queen contest. 

Lovely blonde Kris 
Beerman is a freshman 
at the Regional Campus 
and is ma,1oring in 
Sociology, 

"Wednesday night when 
theyamounced the queen 
I was too tired to rea- 
lize I'd won. It didn't 
seem real. But the next 
morning I was really ex- 
cited", said Kris. 

Almost all remember 
the skydivers falling 
for Kris. When asked 
what she thought of the 
exhibition she simply 
answered, "It was neatl" 
Kris, who graduated 
from Heritage High 
School, is hoping to at-

wmmmmst^nmimmm mmmmmm 



It's time to do 
something. 

In spirit, the Pollu- 
tion Teach-In is not 
over. The loyal stu- 
dents who backed the 
Teach-in are now in the 
beginning stages of 
forming a group on this 
campus that would con- 
cern itself with the 
pollution problems that 
were discussed at the 
April 22 event. Rather 
than form just a campus 
club, the group has de- 
cided to become a chap- 
ter of the Izaac Walton 
League. This would be 
the First campus chap- 
ter of its kind in the 
country. 

On Monday, May i|, 
Tom Dustin, ii^xecutive 
Secretary from the 
Izaak Walton League, 
Port Wayne ChapteT-. 
spoke with the small 
group that was assem- 
bled and described gen- 
eral activities and 
goals of the League, 
He urged that a chapter 
be formed at this cam- 
pus and the idea was 
enthusiastically accept- 
ed by the small group. 

The following Wednes- 
day another meeting was 
held and the group e- 
lected temporary offi- 
cers: 

President--K a r e n 
Griggs; First Vice-Pres- 
ident — Cathy Bradley, 
Second Vice-Preaident;-- 
John Slmerman; Sec re- 
tary -- Diane ITorth ; 
Treasurer — Jean West; 
Constitution Committee 
—Betty Tonsingo 

Unfortunately the 
list of officers constj^ 
tutes approximately 90% 
xof the group. That's 
why they need you. 



THEATER 



Poor. Sxster Geo^^e 



The 1 test Purdue- 
Indiana Ttir-atre produc- 
tion is Frank rlarcus' 
The Killing Of oisb(.r 
George . Willifim Turek 
had Clone a fine job of 
directing the play 
even though it is a 
/ijjjT-ioult one to stage, 
especially in a city 
whose vice squad is as 
conservative as .L'^oi't 
Wa^me's. Those who 
expeft the PIT produc- 
tion to include i the 
sensational Pesbiam 
torridity of the mo- 
tion picture version 
will be soiaew.iat dis- 
ai.poonted. Por thea- 
tre-tA:oers who enfoy -an 
impressive portrayal 
of emotionally involved 
charact-TS, ciowever , 
bjLster Georr;e will be 
round to be a very mo- 
ving play. ^ 

What first impressed 
me in the production 
was the detail of the 
set. The action of the 
play takes place in an 
' apartment shared by 
; bister George and Chil- 
dee hcPaught. One sidd 
of the sta{-;.:e is covered 
with shelves full of 
Ohildie's dolls _while 
the opposite side holds 
(Teorge's trophies and 
is dominatea by a con- 
spiciously heavy btm- 
nistej which leads a 
staircase of f "ftie stage. 
The two sides of the 
,. stage seem to parallel 
' the internal x&gt;&lt;-rsonali- 
' ties of Ghildie who is 
■ weak and dependent , and 
bister George, wtio is 
ayhletic and autborita- 
. raan. 



^itie play deals with 
the psychological kil- 
ling of Jiine Puckridre 
(bister George), played 
by Suzanne Winans. June 
is a BBC star who plays 
bist' r George , a kindly 
old nun v^io CMres for 
her flocl: of sinners, on 
a daily r.-dio pror^am. 
Tlie bister Gscrge of the 
r:dio program ±i. quite 
like iDcLay's Plying ITun, 
cxceT't s!ie riden p mo- 
torbike instead of fly- 
in r-;. June goes by the 
name of Ci.-^.ter George 
in real life, but at 
homo, 5i;e has the mrin- 
ncrisras of a r-irty old 
n;.n. The vl-j por- 
trays June's reactions 
to being v;ritten out of 
the script of '"he seri- 
al. 

O^jildie, plf-yet^ ^^ 
Erin IPilsena, is a weak- 
will'.d v/omcn vjho turns 
to find love ;-;nd secu- 
rity in George, having 
failed t-~' fint' thf-m in 
men. 3hc violently op- 
poses Sister Geo^-gc 
from time to time, but 
she always ends by iudb- 
; ling herself before her 
powerful mistress. 
i Julia Bucheit plays 
iMt8. Nercy, the prim and 
priggish exectutive of 
the BBC who virtually 
controls the iSister 
George show. Mrs. 
Mercy is proporly femi- 
nin in speech and ac- 
tions, but her strange 
attraction to Ghildie, 
and her almost sadistic 
manipulation of the 
characters of the radio 
programs discourage 
complete trust in her,
