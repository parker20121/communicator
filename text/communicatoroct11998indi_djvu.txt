Mastodon skeleton leads to excavation 



Chief Reporter 

A full scitle excavation of ihc 
mastodon found on Dan 
Bucsching's peal bog ai his western 
Allen County farm will begin next 
week. 

Although much of the forward 
skeleton has been recovered, the 
work has just begun for 1PFW stu- 
dents and faculty involved. 

"It's been very complete and 
inlacl so far," John Weddell. sup- 
port person for the IPFW arcbeo- 
logical survey said. "It's a lot larg- 
er than the average mastodon." 

Weddell has been working to 
preserve the recovered bones. 

The toe bones, left leg, a rib 
bone and vertebrae, along with the 
skull and right mandible, are 
already ai IPFW slowly drying out. 

"The tusks have been located 
and are estimated to be eight feet 
long," Weddell said. "We think it 
was lying on its right side." 

Although finding portions of 
mastodons in northern Indiana is 
not an unusual occurrence, the 
location of an almost complete 
skeleton is. 

Other possible factors could 
make this find even more 
Important. 

"There is a chance that this 
mastodon will be associated with 
stone projectile points." professor 
of anthropology Jean-Paul Provost 
said. "This would infer something 
about the lives of prehistoric 
human populations." 



Finding human remains 

involved with other animals is 
uncommon in the United States. 

Fossils supporting such interac- 
tion have only been found a few 
limes in the western portion of the 
United Stales. 

"There are very few direct 
associations between humans and 
mastodons in the eastern United 
States. We'd like to have some 
direct evidence that it was hunted 
or even scavenged by human 
beings," Director of the archeolog- 
ical survey /research program and 
assistant director of cultural 
resource management, sociology 
and anthropology. Dr. Ed Smith 
said. "This is a long shot but would 
be a big deal for Paleo-Indian 
research." 

Negotiations are still being 
made on ownership rights to the 
animal. 

Until then, IPFW will continue 
to head the excavation and preser- 
vation of the mastodon. 

Anthropology major Kevin 
Griggs was one of the first people 
to have access 10 the find, 

"They called me, and I went 
out with them. They had already 
uncovered the head and some 
bones so we took them back to 
the lab," Griggs said. 

"It will be at least a month- 
long excavation. However, exca- 
vation lakes only about a third as 
long as the research." 

According to Smith, there is 
a large amount of research that 
can be done for this type of find. 

"There's a lot of research 



IU president: 

Indiana's economic 
future and yours 



I.) U I'r^idcnt M&gt;lf Brand 
Special Guest 

Welcome back to one of the 
campuses where Indiana's eco- 
nomic future future is being 
shaped. 

You have come to IPFW, in 
part, to improve your personal eco- 
nomic futures. 

Hoosiers need job opportuni- 
ties in growing, high-tech fields. 

Through such advances as the 
Abilene project at IUPUI- the 
operations center for a new. faster 
Internet 2-and our medical 
research efforts, we are trying to 
lead the way to Indiana's more 
high-icch economic future. 

But as important as it is, high- 
tech is only one part of our focus. 

Keeping Indiana University 
accessible to a diverse student 
body, and helping those students 
persevere and succeed is vital. 

IPFW is home 10 many non- 
traditional students. Some of you 
are returning after a long absence 
from the classroom. 

We know that transition can be 




tough. 

To make it easier, we arc seek- 
ing support from the legislature 
this year for our student retention 
efforts-including counseling, 
tutoring and student life programs. 
We are also working to make 
sure that every Indiana University 
campus is a welcoming communi- 
ty for all qualified students. 

One important step was the 
hiring of Dr. Charlie Nelms, for- 
mer chancellor at the University of 
Michigan, Flint as a special assis- 
tant to the president with responsi- 
bilities for diversity and student 
attainment. 

We are particularly proud of 
the efforts undertaken by our 
regional campuses to reach into 
their communities to find and help 
students who could benefit from an 
IU education. 

Helping those students achieve 
their goals must be our focus. 

Whether you are coming to 
IPFW for the first time or reluming 
to continue your education here, 
your studies should give you the 
tools you need to succeed and 
access to courses that will lead to 
promising careers. 

For all the changes at 
your campus, one thing is 
not going lo change. 

Providing a (op-qualiiy 
education in a diverse uni- 
versity setting while con- 
trolling tuition cosls will 
remain our mission. 

Welcome. Your success 
and our success go hand in 
hand. 



What's on your

potential from the surrounding 
matrix and the actual skeleton and 
Ihe vegetation at the time, things 
like thai," Smith said. 

"Hopefully, we'll find some 
associated animals from the same 
lime period. As for the mastodon. 
we'll see where he falls in his pop- 
ulation, age, sex, and his overall 
state of health." 

Until the excavation is com- 
plete, the full extent research possi- 
bilities will remain unknown. 

In the meantime, the name 
"Peal," since the mastodon was 
found in a peat bog, has been sug- 
gested for the mastodon remains. 

"A complete skeleton would be 
an excellent addition 10 the univer- 
sity, because it allows us to show 
people the ancient fauna of pre-his- 
toric Indiana," Provost said. 

"Scientifically excavated 
mastodons are a rarity and this is a 
wonderful opportunity for students 
to carryout a full scientific dig."

Online System brings enrollment to students 



Beginning Oct. I. students will be able to 
access grades, schedules, account summaries and 
eventually, they will be able to register online 
from the convenience of their home via die 
World Wide Web. 

Through the Lilly Online Access to ihe 
Student Information System (OASIS), students 
will have greater access to their records, and fac- 
ulty will soon be able to view class lists and stu- 
dents' grades and transcripts. 

Funded by support from the Lilly Retention 
Initiatives Grant. IPFW allocated 5175,000 to 
improve Student Information Systems (SIS), and 
purchased a server and various software pack- 
ages to help facilitate IPFW's enrollment 
process. 

SIS, which is used by admissions, registrar, 
financial aid, bursar, and faculty advisers, 
encompasses the entry, storage, processing, and 
retrieval of student data, and will now allow 
secure access to students, faculty and advisers. 

This secure online system can be accessed 
with student ID and PIN (Personal Identification 
Number) from the student's home, campus e- 



mail kiosks and class labs, or wherever there is 
access to an interment browse. 

Through the World Wide Web, participants 
link to the OASIS home page, which allows 
access lo the "Student Information Access" link. 

Students will be able lo view basic informa- 
tion about their enrollment status, and faculty 
and advisers will gain access to student enroll- 
ment information. 

In (he initial stage of the OASIS project, stu- 
dents will able to view class schedules, the class 
catalog, grades, classes on hold, financial aid 
awards and tracking information, fee assess- 
ments and account summaries. 

At first, the information will be accessible 
eight to 10 hours a day. 

This stage will soon be expanded to include 
admission application, viewing of application 
status and information requests. 

Students will be able (o determine if their 
transcripts, letters of recommendation and other 
required information have been received by the 
admissions office. 

Stage two. which will be made available sec- 



ond semester, will include information geared to 
facuity. 

This stage will allow faculty to view their 
schedule, class lists, and student transcripts, 
transfer credits and grades. 

In stage three, students will be able to drop 
or add classes, and faculty will be able to view 
student regisuraiion and provide a credit over- 
ride. 

This new system will reduce the administra- 
tive office workload by providing faculty and 
advisers direct access lo the information they 
need to assist students. 

"This is really exciting for IPFW," said 
Chancellor Michael Wancll. "We are putting 
more information into the hands of our students 
and making our university more accessible. 
Many of our students are busy with work and 
family, and this sysiem allows them access at 
their convenience We are literally bringing the 
university to our students."

Learn about the world at lunch 



hy Mishanna Wood 



News Editor 

Care to leant about topics per- 
taining to our world and meet inter- 
esting people at the same time? 

The honors program will host 
seminars at Walb 222. at noon. 
every other Monday, Oct .21 
through Nov. 30. 

This is a free program where 
honors faculty members inform stu- 
dents about their areas of interest. 

IPFW students and professors 
will have the opportunity to meet 
face to face 

The first seminar, conducted by 
Carl Drummond. assistant profes- 
sor of geosciences, focused on the 
importance o( the true role of sci- 
ence education, present and. future, 
for non-science majors. 

"It was a lot of fun," 
Drummond said. 

The second seminar, "From 
Home to Rome and Back," Oct. 5. 
Ls conducted by Matthew Kubik, 
Honors program director. 



For the past eight years, 
Kubik's interest in the subject came 
from a summer course he teaches 
about Rome and architecture. 

Buildings in Fort Wayne will be 
compared to those of the ancients. 
for example Norlh Side High 
School to the Parthenon. 

"Nonviolence," on Nov. 2, pre- 
sented by Richard L. Johnson, 
associate professor of German, will 
inform students on the wide spec- 
trum of nonviolence in the world. 

This topic can relale to one's 
personal life or something larger, 
such as foreign policy. 

Students will have the chance 
to discuss these topics among Ihe 
group. 

The program began two years 
ago out of a weekly lunch table in 
the cafeteria. 

Students had the opportunity to 
sit with professors and listen to 
them speak about various topics. 

The seminar is more organized 
than the weekly lunch table in 
bringing people together. 



The times and dates for the 
other presentations are as follows: 
Oct. 19, "Art, Architecture and 
You," by Robert Zahrt, associate 
faculty in Civil and Architectural 
Engineering Technology, and Nov. 
30, "The Electronic Library," by 
Judith L. Violette, director of 
library studies and liberal studies. 

"The seminar is an opportunity 
for students to meet a larger number 
of faculty in a low stress atmos- 
phere," Kubik said. 

The honors program serves stu- 
dents who are looking for a higher 
intellectual challenge. 

Ten percent of the student body 
is currently involved in this 
program. 

Any student is eligible to be 
involved if he or she has at least a 
3.3 grade -point average. 

A student can get written per- 
mission from the professor teach- 
ing the course if his or her GPA is 
lower than 3.3. 

Classes are limited to 20 stu- 
dents or less and are offered in gen- 



eral education courses or concen- 
trated courses. 

Faculty who teach these cours- 
es are known for their expertise. 

"This is a real partnership in 
learning between the students and 
the faculty," Kubik said 

Ihe honors program wants to 
start to define the whole 
community. 

The lunch seminar is a small 
part of that effort. 

On Oct. 6 there is a recognition 
for honors students at the Fort 
Wayne Museum of An from 6:30 to 
7:30 p.m. 

Students can view the exhibits 
until 8:30 pm.. 

A Halloween stargazing party 
at Fox Island's observatory on Oct. 
29 is open to everyone. 

For reservations, call Matthew 
Kubik at 692-t810. 

"The honors classes are classes 
of experiential learning," Kubik 
said.

We don't think that peo-

of how they can make this 
world a belter place lo live in. 

Sure, ihey sec all of the 
violence on television and 
say, "Hey, that's bad." People 
just don'i care about the sim- 
ple little things that everyone 
can do lo make our environ- 
ment cleaner. 

They teach this to kids in 
school. It's so simple thai 
first-graders can do it. It's 
called recycling. 



"reduce, renew, and 
recycle." the three R's. 

If kids can do it, 
why can't we. 
Everyday we see peo- 
ple buying pop cans 
and plastic bottles at the 
vending machine. 

Do you know 
where those cans and 
bottles end up most of 
the time? From 
we see. they end up in 
campus trash cans. That's right, they 
don't end up in recycling bins, but in 
trash cans. 

All of the trash from trash cans 
goes to a landfill. If you have ever 
seen a landfill in our area, you know

Do thou but thine!"

thai il is noi a pretty sight, with trash 
piled up for as far as the eye can see. 
Why would we warn to add lo the pile? 
There are a lot of places to recycle 
paper on this campus, but the alu- 
minum can recycling bins are few and 
far between. We haven't seen any plas- 
tic recycling bins on 
campus yet. 

Something needs lo 
be done about this. 
There need lo be more 
places lo recycle plas- 
tic bottles and alu- 
minum cans around 
here. After that, people 
need 10 be made aware 
of where the recycling 
stations are at It does- 
n't do any good to 
have the recycling bins 
if no one ever uses 
them. 

There are no bad 
points to recycling, 
and we feel thai per- 
haps the campus 
should encourage it 
more.

I work here at the paper. I work 35-40 hours at 
another job. I'm in my third year of full-time class- 
es here For me, it seems like my workday never 
ends, I'm constantly going from one place to 
another, trying to make enough money lo pay the 
bills and have a little left over to have some fun. If 
your schedule throughout the week is anything like 
mine, you can't wait for a day off. 

For the fust time this semester, I had a day off 
last Friday No work, no school, not anything that 
I really was committed to. I know that it's some- 
thing that I was supposed lo be exciled about, bui 
with the change in the weaiher last week I spent 
most of the day with a tissue in my hand. I could 
hardly breathe. I was congested, and I couldn't find 
any medicine that would help me feel better. I 
stayed in bed till about noon trying to feel belter. 
As a matter of fact, I still have some congestion. 
This cold was just the lip of the iceberg for things 
to come on my day off. 

The first thing that I did was to go to the hank 
and cash my checks to try and make my car pay- 
ment and other assorted bills. 

To pay my bills I needed to go get some 
envelopes and sumps, and that meant running lo 
the store. Well, I went lo the store and found thai 
after I waned in line for iwcnty minutes to buy 
stamps, they didn'i have any. I decided that I might 
as well get the envelopes while I was there. This 
part pretty much went without a hitch, but I still 
needed some stamps. 

I was gelling hungry by then, so I decided to 
go back to my apartment. When I gol back to my 
apartment, there was a message on the answering 
machine for me to call my mother. I wasn't sure if 
I really wanted lo spend my lime finding oul what 
she was going to do this weekend or just find out 
later. I fixed myself some mac and cheese, and 
went on another quest to find some stamps. 

I decided thai I should jusi go to the sourcc- 
the post office-and get some stamps. 1 stood in line 
ai ihe post office to get a book of stamps. After 
about five minuies of being there, my nose started 
lo leak like a faucet. 

I had no choice but lo make a break for the 
bathroom. 1 took care of the leaky nose, and then 
noticed that the line was longer than before. 1 guess 
that I didn't need loo many siamps, so I just gol 
some change oul of my car and boughi the stamps 
individually out of the machines. I got enough

change out of my car for all the stamps I need. 

It was then about S p.m., so I decided that I had 
enough fun for now. So I just warned to go back to 
my apartment and relax for a bit. I got back lo my 
apartment, and my fiance lefl me a note mat I 
needed to have some clean cloihes for a 50ih birth- 
day party that we were supposed lo go to on 
Saturday. Thai meant that I had lo do some laun- 
dry. 1 don't know of any guy who likes to do 
laundry. 

So I got a basket together, look it lo the base- 
mem of my apartment building and found out lhat 
there weren't any free washers. I waited around for 
about an hour to see if anyone was going to get his 
or her laundry, then I gave up and took my laundry 
lo my mother's house. 

1 goi to my mother's house and she greeted me 
at the door. She questioned me about why I never 
called her back. I just told her that I had been busy 
and needed io do a load of laundry. She said thai I 
had to wail until she finished the load thai was in 
there. That meant lhat I had to listen to my moiher 
talk for a half hour about how she was going to this 
craft show in Michigan and how she hoped thai she 
was going in lind a bargain (don'i get me wrong, I 
love my mother, but sometimes silence is golden). 
I did my load of laundry, and went back lo my 
.apartment, 

I gol back io my apartment and threw a copy of 
Lucio Fulci's "Zombie" into the VCR. Not len 
minuies into the movie, my fiance came home. 
Once again, this was another thing that 1 should 
have been looking forward lo. She walked in, 
flopped herself on the bed and wrapped herself in 
ihe comforter. I asked her wbal was wrong and she 
threw up on the carpel. Great, one bad day just got 

I cleaned up the mess, and tried to take care of 
her as besi as 1 could until about 11:30 p.m. when 
I started feeling a dizzy. 1 rushed to the toilet and 
prayed to ihe porcelain god for the next 15 min- 
utes. It seemed lhat one of the kids at my fiance's 
work had a touch of ihe flu and now we had il. 
Now I had a stuffed up nose and a screwed up 
stomach. I think that was enough for one day. 

For every story there is supposed to be a moral. 
I'm not sure what the moral to this story is, but 1 
hope lhat the nexi lime you have a day off il is bet- 
ter than the last one lhat I had.

Well, it's official; the Cubs are 
in the playoffs. We had some people 
over to watch the game on Monday, 
and I couldn't have written a better 
evening. The food, the beverages, 
and the game itself. The Cubs start- 
ing pitcher was throwing a no-hitter 
through six innings; the defense was 
fantastic, (Morandini deserves the 
Gold Glove at second this year), and 
the Cubbies came out on top. This 
article will come out on Thursday 
afternoon; the Cuhs could be up a 
game or down a game going into 
tonight's game at 7 p.m. They will 
head back to Chicago this weekend 
to hopefully wrap the series up. 
Why am 1 excited? Because I'm a 
Cubs fan. 

Yeah, I've heard all of the jokes. 
I've seen the bandwagon fans. I've 
endured just 12 winning seasons in 
the last 33 years. I remember guys 
such as Madlock, Trillo, Moreland. 
Biittner and Buckner. You guys 
probably remember Dawson, 
Dunslon, Sandbcrg and Sutcliffe. 
Now we all remember Grace. 
Gaclti, Wood and especially. 
Sammy Sosa. Our team wasn't great 
this year, but they had heart. They 
came from behind almost 40 limes. 
They got lucky some say, bui that is 
part of the game. 

I had the chance to grow up a 
Cubs fan. In the old days, you root- 



ed for teams your parents cheered 
for. or where you lived. Geography 
played a part in my fanhood. I grew 
up just two hours south of Chicago 
so 1 had a choice, Cubs or Sox. I 
chose the Nonh-Siders because my 
mother was a fan. It was easy, but 
very painful. I don't mind being a 
Cubs fan. I like the Attention. There 
is always some 'yahoo' who picks 
on me. 

When the Cubs have a good 
season, people come out of the 
woodwork. Fine, but stick with it. 
You are welcome to our exclusive 
club. But follow the rules and be 
very patient. We are a very close fra- 
ternity of fans. We have endured 
some very long summers. We have 
something that a lot of other sports 
fans don't have; loyalty, faithful- 
ness, and heartbreak. And remember 
being a fan, and acting like a fan are 
completely different. 

Do I seem defensive? Probably, 
but I have to be. The Cubs could 
lose all three games to Atlanta, and 
I'll have to hear it from everybody. 
It doesn't bother me anymore. It 
used to kill me. Sometimes the Cubs 
were out of it in July. This year they 
actually get to play in October. Our 
expectations have become limited. I 
would love a World Series ring, but 
"beggars can't be choosers." The 
posi season is sweet Bu; will it last? 



If you ask any Cubs fan. I guarantee 
you that they will say that they're 
just happy to make it this far. We 
can only hope that by this time next 
week, we'll still be playing. 

I remember my first game at 
Wrigley Field. I was seven yean, old 
and with my parents. It was 1972 
there was sort of a "mini-strike" 
going on. The Cubbies were pretty 
good. They lost the game that day, 
but I got to see Ernie Banks play. 
The learn finished 85-70, alone in 
second place. It took twelve years 
for them to finish above .500. We all 
remember how great they were in 
1984. 

I remember being at the Cubs' 
first night game. It was August 8, 
1988. The Cubs were in fourth place 
and ended up 25 games out of first. 
It was a magical night. The Cubs 
were the last team to install lights at 
their stadium Baseball was a game 
to be played in the daytime, on grass 



of course. Ibc surrounding neigh- 
borhood fought hard to keep night 
games out of their backyards. They 
finally agreed on just 18 night 
games per season. The skies opened 
up, and it ended up raining that 
night. The game was cancelled. I 
was out SIOO. It was worth it. 

1 also remember 1989. 1 had just 
moved to San Fransisco, and ironi- 
cally, the Cubs had to play the 
Giants for the pennant. I was able to 
gel tickets. The Cubs lost that series 
four games to one. Another great 
year, another painful loss. The 
Giants ended up playing the 
Oakland A's in the World Series and 
got swept in four games. It was the 
only time that an earthquake can- 
celled a World Series game. 

In the 1990s the Cubs are, 
including this year, 673-723. That is 
actually better than they played in 
the two previous decades. They've 
been to the World Series ten times 



and v&gt; 






•. back (i 



back in 

1907-OS. They went to the World 
Series three times in the 1930s and 
lost twice to the some great Yankee 
teams. The last time they went was 
the same year we dropped the bomb 
on Japan in 1945. The Cubs are 2-2 
against Detroit in the scries, 0-2 
against Philadelphia, and 0-1 
against the Sox, both Red and 
White. The fans remember all of 
these dates because they are so 
important. Maybe we can add 1998 
into the mix. It could happen. 

So now, baseball fans will be 
watching. Some will root for the 
Cubs out of sympathy. Some will 
just be happy that these losers have 
made it this far. Some will think that 
the Cubs can go all the way. We'll 
just have to sec what happens. 
Thanks for the great season anyway. 
And we miss you Harry and Jack. 

Be nice, have a great weekend, 
GO CUBS GO!

■fnc-fion Sov\oc, 



foreuer frie^d^, part Oipe: Early Be^ir^ 



As early as Dob could remem- 
ber, Luke had always been there for 



him. 



Boih his mother and Luke's 
moihcr were best friends who had 
both gotten pregnant around the 
same lime and gave birth to their 
children within a month of each 
Other. 

From the first day ihcy entered 
each other's lives, they were best 
friends. 

Although Bob was really a 
month younger than Luke, it was as 
though they were bom twins. 

As Bob reflected upon his 
younger days, there wasn't a 
moment in his life that he didn't 
remember Luke being there or 
close by. 

They were blood brothers that 
cut their teeth upon the same ring 
of life and would always remain 
one inseparable unit. 

Although Bob had many memo- 
ries he enjoyed thinking about in 
his 15 years of existence, perhaps 
one of his favorite ones occurred 
when he was around eight. 

Mis mother and Luke's mother 
had both finally consented to let- 
ting him and Luke go fishing by 
themselves in the densely forested 
hills that neighbored their homes. 

Rising early one summer 
morning with big smiles on their 
faces, they both set out with nearly 
every possible item a paranoid 
mother could arm their sons with. 

They Felt like grown-ups that 
day as they braved the wilderness, 
seeking the perfect spot to fish the 
day away. 

After a while, they finally 
found their fishing paradise, it by^his boyhood crush. 

A little lagoon surrounded by 
semi-steep rocks and enshrouded 
by trees would be where they 
would set up their camp for the day, 
completely unsupervised. 

The moment was better to Bob 
than a game of baseball, he remem- 
bered, as he baited a worm on his 
hook and cast out his line. 

It was now only a matter of 
time until Bob and Luke, profes- 
sional fishermen, received their 
first claim to success. 

The day crept slowly on as Bob 
and Luke conversed underneath the 
shade of the trees, constantly 
checking to see if a fish might have 
caught itself on one of their hooks 
while they weren't looking. 

Much to their surprise, the fish 
seemed to elude them, although 
their worms did have a mysterious 
tendency to fall of the hooks pretty 
easily. 

They went home that day with 
a lot of memories and a little disap- 
pointment as they explained to 



their mothers that the fish must 
have been too afraid of their fishing 
skills to come near them. 

Bob always smiled when he 
recalled that day. 

As great as that memory made 
him feel, Bob could recall a time 
when he actually felt better than he 
did that day. 

When he was 13, his middle 
school had a dance for Bob, Luke, 
and their classmates in which the 
girls were supposed to ask the guys 
to accompany them instead of lite 
other way around. 

Bob remembered how excited 
he was when he first learned about 
it, as he had a crush on one of the 
girls in his math class for months 
prior to the dance and could never 
find the courage lo ask her to go 
steady with him. 

This dance would provide her 
the opportunity to ask him, he fig- 
ured, and he would be off the hook 
and happy again. 

In the weeks preceding the 
dance, Bob did everything he could 
to gel the attention of the girl he so 
longed to ask out, hoping she 
would notice him and ask him to 
the dance. 

Every day he met with the 
anticipation that the day lying 
ahead of him was going to be the 
day his dreams would be fulfilled. 

As the day of the dance drew 
slowly near, Bob maintained his 
high spirits, still believing she was 
just too shy to ask him loo early 
before the dance and that the next 
day his prayers would be heard and 
answered. 

There was still plenty of time 
left for her to ask him to the dance. 

After weeks of anticipation, the 
day of the dance finally came and 
Bob was still waiting to be asked to 



As' the bell rang for class to be 
over, Bob nervously waited outside 
Ihe class for the girl, only to see her 
walk off with one of his other 
friends. 

Devastated, Bob went home 
and locked himself up in his room 
to sulk Tor a couple of hours. 

Right before dinner time, Bob 
heard a knock on his door and 
Luke's familiar voice outside. 

Luke had come over lo play 
basketball with Bob. dumping his 
date to the dance for an evening 
with his friend in need. 

Although Luke didn't admit it 
at the time, he told Bob later that he 
would never leave him behind, just 
as Bob should never leave him 
behind. 

Tbey were best friends, and 
that was how it was always going 
lobe. 

Nothing should ever come 
between ihem. 

And so it was for Bob and Luke 
for the two years leading to this 
point in Bob's life. 



He and Luke would try out for 
the same sports and always make 
the team together, although they 
both excelled in different sports. 

They tried to get into the same 
classes at school and usually suc- 
ceeded; if they didn't, they would 
always find themselves hanging 
out together between classes with 
their mutual friends, saying how 
bad their classes were and that they 
wished they were in ihe same 
classes. 

They were two brothers with- 
out Ihe conflict of having to vie for 
the attention of ihe same set of par- 
ents, and things were rarely bad 
between the iwo. 

The only time Bob could recall 
things being close to intolerable 
between him and Luke was when 
they'd botli met their current girl- 
friends. 

As Luke had met his girlfriend 
first. Bob had a hard lime gelling 
used to not seeing as much of Luke 
and was made to deal with it alone, 
for the most part. 

A few short months later, 
though, Luke found himself in ihe 
same situation Bob was in when 
Bob met the girl he was currently 
dating. 

Pretly soon, however, they 
managed to work things out 
between themselves and decided to 
start going out more often as a 
group instead of just couples. 

Things worked oul pretty well, 
and soon after Bob and Luke's girl- 
friends were almost as close as Bob 
and Luke were. 

None of them could remember 
the lasl time they had felt so good 
about life, or when they had been 
so happy to see Iheir friends. 

About a year after Luke had 
started dating his girlfriend, 
though, his health began lo decline 
and he found himself missing 
school more and more each week. 

After a month of chronic ill- 
ness, Luke's mom finally took him 
in to have his blood checked for 
infection and his inner-organs to be 
analyzed. 

Bob remained ai his side the 
entire time, just as he had promised 
he always would, and was with him 
die day they found out whai was 
wrong with him. 

Luke was dying from a rare 
form of stomach cancer. 

It was thus with misly eyes that 
Bob, his girlfriend, and Luke's girl- 
friend proceeded up the hospital 
elevator to Luke's room thai April 
morning to be with Luke as his life 
drew quickly lo an end.

Staff Writer 

Well, it's finally October, And if 
you haven't noticed from all the 
store decorations that went up a 
month ago, that means Halloween is 
just around the comer. 

What can you do to gel into the 
"Halloween spirit"? If you already 
know Ihe 101 ways to mutilate 
humans, horror movies might not do 
it for you. 

And unlike Christmas' "true 
meaning." Halloween's isn't as well 
known. 

Well, just for your sake, I went 
web hunting and came up will) sev- 
eral weeks' worth of sites. 

This week I used sites with 
ghost stories and such. Some are 
real claims made by the site's 
author, where some are just jokes. 

But remember- I won't take 
sides on the validity of these stories. 

Well. 1 lake that back. I'm quite 
sure of the fact that the site that par- 
odies paranormal expert Richard 
Hoagland isn't valid. 

But I'll lake a neutral approach 
to the other sites. 

However, if 1 can crack on a 
siie, I'll do it only for the sake of 



fulfilling my required article length. 

http://wwv,.oa ktree.net/wil/haunl/ 
tndex.html 

When I found this siie in Yahoo, 
it was described as a running 
account of one man's haunted apart- 
ment. I couldn't resist. 

This guy says he always feels as 
if he is being watched. Then he says 
one day he spotted fog by the top of 
his siairs (he has a diagram on the 
site). 

Nothing happened, though, 
until one day he had a party. 

He says that three of his friends. 
his cat, and he himself spotted ihe 
"ectoplasm" again. 

If you visit this site, take a look 
at the "mystery" spot. 

1 can think of twenty things it 
resembles. ' 

He also says that one of his 
friends was too drunk to care. 

Using my supreme powers of 
deduction. 1 have come lo the con- 
clusion that the specter's name was 
"Jack Daniel." 

http://www.ro.com/-shiiwn/ghost. 
html 

This site is another ghost story- 



telling site. As in ihe last site, the 
author claims his accounts arc non- 
fiction. 

This site, however, allows input 
by the audience. 

Ihe author insists that any cre- 
ative stories are acceptable, but non- 
fiction is preferable. 

I didn't Lake the time lo read any 
of the stories, but I'll bet they're 
worth seeing. 

One catch in submiiting stories 
is that they MUST be clean. 

Actually. I think the site would 
gel more hits if it involved unclean 
experiences. 

http://www.haunted-place.corn 

This site is a directory of sorts. 
It lists all places around the country 
that have had paranormal 
experiences. 

None of the current activities 
were listed as being in Indiana, 
though. 

Maybe the "United Spectral 
Union, Local 926," boycoticd 
Indiana for some reason. 

Overall, ihe site only has one 
known occurrence in Indiana. 

It claims thai ihe second floor of 
a huilding in Indianapolis is haunied 
hy the house's original owner and 



that the stench of death is 
overpowering. 

For those who are interested, 
the site has directions to ihe haunied 
house. 

Who would go lo Florida this 
spring break knowing they could go 
lo a haunied house in Indianapolis 
and gel the stench of death burning 
in their nostrils? 

http://www.geocitles.com/ 
Hollywood/Hilts/3145/ 

This site is a parody of current 
conspiracy theories. I only went lo a 
couple of ihe topics, though. 

One of the topics I found lo be 
humorous is the "Invincible 
Soldiers." 

Ihe author says ihat he has 
received a photo from a source 
within the "Invincible Soldiers" 
conspiracy. 

The phoio of the invincible sol- 
dier happens to be Wile E. Coyoie 
blackened by the dynamite of one of 
his failed Roadrunncr traps. 

Chances are. some X-Files 
fanatic has visiled the siie and is 
carefully scrutinizing ihe photo as 
we speak.

Hispanos Unidos recognizes heritage 



hy Carrie Anne Leathers 



Chief Reporter 

As National Hispanic Heritage 
momh continues lo celebrate 
Hispanic heritage throughout the 
United States. (PFW's own 
Hispanos Unidos is also recogniz- 
ing the Hispanic heritage month. 

"THe main thing Hispanos 
Unidos is trying to do is get the 
community as a whole to recognize 
all aspects or the Hispanos cul- 
ture," Hispanos Unidos president, 
Salvador Soto said. "The Hispanic 
population has more than tripled in 
the past ten years and we have all 
di fferent cu I lures and 
nationalities." 

Earlier on during Hispanic her- 
itage month. Hispanos Unidos 
offered a night to learn salsa, 
cumbia, merengue. and other 
dances, courtesy of the group. 
There was also a day to come sam- 
ple a variety of Hispanic foods. 



"We had 70-80 people show up 
(for the dance lessons)," Soto said. 
"We were only expecting 50, so it 
was a really great turnout." 

Around 35 students are cur- 
rently members of Hispanos 
Unidos, however not all members 
are Hispanic. 

The group's main purpose is to 
leach non-Hispanics about the 
diversity of the Hispanic culture. 

"We don't want students to 
think that they have lobe Hispanic 
to be in Hispanos Unidos," Soto 
said. "As long as you're interested 
in die Hispanic culture, that's what 
we are trying to promote." 

Although the group is from 
IPFW, the community is always 
invited lo attend any activities held 
by Hispanos Unidos. 

They also reach oul to area 
high schools and middle schools, to 
get Spanish students involved. 

"High school teachers love that 
it gives them something to imple- 
ment in class." Solo said. 



Hispanos Unidos is involved 
in outreach programs with some of 
ihc non-profit, minority-based 
organizations in Fon Wayne as 
well. 

To further the group's ability 
and knowledge, Hispanos Unidos 
members will be attending the 
Hispanic Leadership Conference in 
Chicago Oct. 1-4, the largest in the 
country. 

"Last year, attending the con- 
ference gave us a lot of unity as a 
group," Solo said. "I really recom- 
mend it to any other students. 

There are a loi of speakers 
from around the country, and they 
teach you aboui having activities or 
how to look for grants." 

On Friday, Oct. 16, Hispanos 
Unidos will be concluding their 
celebration or National Hispanic 
Month with a Latin cafe. 

They arc hoping to have a 
Hispanic speaker talk about ihe his- 
tory of Hispanics in the United 



BlOOd drive: Hem save ante 



Staff Writer 

A two-week-long blood drive 
sponsored by the Alumni 
Association began Sept. 28 and will 
run through Friday, Oct. II, 

The drive is being held as a 
friendly competition bciween stu- 
dents and alumni from Tri State 
College, Manchester College, IVY 
Tech, ITT Tech. St. Francis 
University, Taylor Fon Wayne, and 
IPFW. 

The Alumni Association was 
inspired to do this blood drive by a 
compciition between IU 



Bloomington and Purdue West 
Lafayette. 

Il is also intended to reconnect 
alumni while serving the communi- 
ty in a positive way. 

All donations can be given at 
Ihe 1212 California Rd. location of 
the Red Cross. 

The Red Cross Blood Mobile 
will be accepting donations on cam- 
pus between Walb Union and 
Helmke Library from 10 a.m to 4 
pjn, on Friday, Oct. 2 . 

Donating blood benefits noi 
only people with blood disease, but 
critical surgery patients, accident 
and nalural disaster victims. 

The Alumni Association hopes 



to make this blood drive an annual 
event as well as awarding a plaque 
or memento lo each year's winner. 

The Red Cross will keep a tally 
of the number of units given by 
each school, making it possible lo 
keep track of which school you rep- 
resent. 

There are, of course, mixed 
feelings about giving blood. 

People who have never donated 
blood before are often apprehen- 
sive, and giving blood can be 
uncomfortable, but the vasi majori- 
ty who donate once become donors 
for life.

A week to remember: McGwire hits 70! 



Staff Writer 
BASEBALL IS BACK! 

The lasi week of Ihc regular season was 
more exciting than any pennant race I've 
ever witnessed. 

Here's proof— a Sunday afternoon in 
September and I was watching the Cubs 
instead of the Bears. Backing their way into 
the playoffs, the Cubs hung on for a 5-3 vic- 
tory over the San Francisco Giants in a one- 
game playoff for the wild card spot Monday 
night at Wrigley Field. 

1 hope all Cubs fans celebrated then, like 
I did, because reality will set in facing 
Smoltz, Clavine, and Maddux 

IT IS FINALLY OVER 

After this, 1 promise, no more 
home run talk — until April. 

Mark McGwire, who last week claimed 
he was content to finish tied with Sosa for 
the home run title, went out and hit five 
home runs in the final week of the season. 

The fact that he finished with 70 is even 



more impressive considering that he walked 
162 times. This sounds like one of those 
records that will stand for years, but with 
three other guys hitting at least 50, I'm nol 
so sure. 

I don' t want to demean any accomplish- 
ments, but there are a number of factors thai 
combined to cause this season's oflensive 
explosion. 

1) Diluted pitching-the two new expan- 
sion teams provided employment for about 
twenty-five pitchers that wouldn't otherwise 
be major-leaguers. A prime example is the 
Atlanta Braves pitching staff, who dominat- 
ed McGwire proving good pitching neutral- 
izes good hitting. 

2) Smaller, hitter- friendly parks are the 
trend in design. CoincidentaJly, Busch 
Stadium in St. Louis brought the fences in a 
few years ago. 

3) Athletes are bigger and stronger than 
ever before. Weight lifting and off-season 
(raining are (he main reasons, bul (he whole 
Andro conwoversy brought the issue of sup- 
plements to the forefront. 

Forget about Andro, because hand eye 
coordination doesn't come in a bottle. What 
Andro may have done was push his 400-foot 
homers another 100 feet or so. 




MIRACLE SEASON IN BRONX??? 

The New York Yankees completed a 
dream season highlighted by David Wells 
'perfect game, Bemie Williams' baiting tide, 
and, most importantly, an American League 
record- winning 1 14 games. 

The Yankees did look vulnerable down 
die stretch, but they had (heir division 
wrapped up in mid-May so it is natural to 
lose some intensiiy in such a long season. 

They are still the odds on favorite to win 
the World Series, and began that crusade 
Tuesday with a 2-0 win over the Texas 
Rangers at Yankee Stadium. 

The other two games were dominated by 
individual performances from the Padres 
Kevin Brown and the Red Sox Mo Vaughn. 

Brown struck out sixteen Astros in (he 
Padres 2-1 victory over Houston ace Randy 
Johnson in the Astrodome. Vaughn led the 
Red Sox wi(h a playoff record tying seven 
RBl's in their 11-3 dismantling of the 
Indians at Jacob's Field. 

My predictions: Yankees over (he Red 
Sox in five. Braves over Astros in seven, and 
in the World Series— Yankees defea( Braves 
in six. For entertainment only, of course, but 
if you warn to make big time SSS, bet 
against every team I picked. A 
Cubs/Indians World Series? 

FOOTBALL TAKES BACKSEAT 

I was all set to give you at least ten 
reasons why college football is not 
only more exciting overall, but better 
to watch than pro football, and I will, 
another lime. 

Last weekend, there were no major 
upsets in college football, although 
Purdue gave a viclory to the Irish, 
who won 31-30. For once, most of 
the professional games were close 
until the end, lowlighted by the woe- 
ful Bears and Colts. 

Once again both teams were able to 
salvage defeat from the jaws of victo- 
ry. I'm not sure which is worse, 
watching the Colls get blown out each 
week, or watching the Bears squander 
half-time leads in all of their four 
losses.

Womens Tennis ready for tournament 



Editor 

The 1998 IPFW womens lennis 
learn has had a phenomena) year. 

The learn has compiled an 
impressive 12-3 record, 8-2 in the 
GLVC, placing them second in the 
conference. 

Boih athletically and academi- 
cally, (he learn is the epitome of 
whal a collegiate sports (earn should 
be. 

In the las! two years the team 
has gone 16-4 in GLVC play and 
has an accumulated a GI'A of 3.3. 

"I am very proud of my girls, 1 
ask a lot out of ihcm and they give 
me everything they have." Coach 
■'■in said. "Sometimes I think I 
might ask loo much, hui this is one 
of the better teams 1 have and I 
undersiand Ihcir potential." 

There are plenty of things going 
right for the team ihis season but the 
thing that separates this team from 
teams in the past is heart 

"Our girls come to play. They 
lay it all on the line, Jay in and day 
out. I am proud of what ihey do and 
excited to sec how ihey play at (he 
GLVC tournament coming up next 
week," 

The one and two spots arc 
arguably the toughest two spots to 
play alany level in tennis. 

At number one singles, Dawn 
Caryer could be one of the best in 
the conference. 

As a sophomore, Caryer has 
stepped up her play and has pro- 
duced big numbers this year Tor the 
Dons. 

Caryer, 7-6. has played very 
well as of late. She will have to 
continue her winning ways for the 
Dons to go deep in the tournament. 

Jcnna llarmeyer also a sopho- 
more, has played well this season. 

"She is a very special player for 
us," Coach Morton said. "She gives 
a 110 percent every timeout," 

At the three spot, senior captain 
Becky Bcrmcs could be the best in 
the GLVC. 

"She does everything right," 



Coach Honon said. "1 have been 
around tennis a long time and 
Bcrmcs is what a every tennis play- 
er dreams ofbeing. She docs a great 
job on the court (16-2) and an 
incredible job in the classroom." 

Bcrmcs is the heart and soul of 
this team and should be in top form 
for the tournament. 

One of the biggest pleasures of 
the season this year has been the 
play of Laura Fisher. 

Fisher, from Bellmont, has 
played a pivotal role for the Dons, 
giving her all in every match of the 
season. 

Fisher is a true compedtor, and 
sets a great example of what a team 
player should be. She leads by 
example and is great for this 
■ program. 

"Fisher is a fun player to watch, 
her competition level is so intense 
she understands the different levels 
of being good and being great," 
Honon said. "She is a nice player to 
have, especially the way she is pro- 
gressing and helping this team." 

Complementing Fisher is 
Christina Pape and Melissa George. 

Papc is as consistent a player, as 
you will find. 

As ESPN SporlsCenter 
announcer Stuart Scott would say, 
"She is as cool as the other side of 
the pillow," 

"Her level-headedncss and pos- 
itive altitude arc two of her biggest 
assets on the court," Coach Honon 
said. 

At the sixth spot, Melissa 
George is a complete player. 

She is the total package and a 
great competitor. 

"George is 12-3, and I always 
tell her that she has not been beaten 
by her opponents but rather she 
beats herself with her 
aggressiveness." 

Also complementing this team 
is Iwo-spon athlelc April Hatch. 
Hatch, who was recruited by 
Womens Basketball Coach Pam 
Bowden has done a great job con- 
tributing to the team. 

That is just another aspect of 
this team. "As a department we real- 



ly try to help each other out." Not an easy task, but Honon 

Honon said. "Now it is my job to will be concentrating on the upcom- 
find a 6'6" lennis player who can ing GLVC tournament where be 
shoot the rock." believes IPFW is capable of win- 

ning it all.
