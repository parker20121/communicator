American Diploma project gains momentum

Wilh Michigan's promise 



Project this month. 13 slates, in- 
cluding Indiana, have agreed to 
the project's declared commit- 
ment to strengthen high school 
academic standards. 

The America Diploma 
Project is an effort to raise stan- 
dards of accountability and as- 



sessment between 
and high schools. The project 
is lead by The Education Trust, 
The Thomas B. Fordham Foun- 
dation, Achieve Inc. and'fhe Na- 
tional Alliance of Business. 

Last year the project is- 
sued a report indicating (hat 
high school diplomas bear little 
significance on a student's abil- 
ity to succeed in college or a ca- 
reer. The report recommended 
that high schools initiate more 
rigorous English and math re- 
quirements for all students to 



address this gap. LheADPcon- 
sulted over 300 higher educators 
and business representatives to 
compile their report. 

The specific recommenda- 
tions for English were a greater 
emphasis on written and oral 
communication skills. For 
math, the report suggested stu- 
dents be trained in geometry, 
data and statistical analysis and 
advanced algebra.

ment last October has initiated even more 
discontent in Belarus. The murder has 
widely come to be believed a response to 



revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine. 

Pyotr Nikitenko, an Academic Secre- 
tary of the Arts at the National Academy of 






that Russia is losing control of the former 
Soviet Republics. 

"The former Soviet republics are the 
arena of the most dynamic changes in the 
world, Belarus and Moldova are the next 
states likely tor revolution," he said. 

On Feb. 13 democratic activists, each 
representing a country in the former Soviet 
Union, met publicly with President George 
W. Bush, who committed to support the 



with democratic activists in former Soviet 
republics. "The revolutions that swept this 
region over 15 years ago are now reaching 



Cherkasova s journalistic work 
government information. 

Belarus is the last dictatorship in the President said 
lonnei Soviet Union, and is under pressure 
to reform, especially following the recent 



Georgia and Ukraine, and inevitably, the 
people of Belarus will someday proudly 
belong to the country of democracies," the 



closing comments. 

Flanked by two of his sons, one of whom 
was wearing a l-shirl with innr \;ii:ih,iii -lu^ 
c m ii mi primed on die In nil. Phelps gave opening 



"I'm an old time baptist pre.n her." he said 
Citing vei-.es from (lie Bible, in a deep Southern 
accent. Phelps used several verses to support his 



pandedon his theory. 

"I can't go the heaven if 1 don't repent my 
sins, can If Thai s what they 'homosexuals) go to 
do. They cant live that lifestyle Mo more than an 
adulterer can live thai lifestyle Nil more than a 
bank robber can live that lifestyle. I'm supposed 
to preach it that way," he said. 

Phelps has led several prolests in what he 
sees as the declining Mate ul America. In the past, 
he lias picketed the funeral-. of the mother of 
President Kill Clinton, Frank Sinatra and Sonny 
Mono His opening com ineiits were met with po- 
lite applause. 

Phelps holds main, controversial views in 
regard to contemporary American life. In an in- 
terview with 1 he ( omniunieaior, Phelps claimed 
that "'1/ 1 I was an immediate act ol die vengeance 
and wrath ol (,nd upon this evil nation," and on 
his website he claims (hat the recent tsunami lh.it 
affected a large part ol the world was, like '!/ 1 1 , an 
"immediate act of diving vengeance." 

Dan Funk and k.uhv Sams were the debate 
representatives from Indiana Equality. 

Kathy Sarris related her experiences since 
coming io Indiana to work in the stale govem- 

"I think people have done some great things 
here," she said. 

Funk also introduced himself. 

"lam a gay man, and lam a Christian, and I 
am here lo tell you that God does not hale fags," 









The four questions ,overed die major talk- 
ing points within the gay rights debate. The first 
question asked the debaters to respond to the 
"Laramie Project" and discuss its impact. 

While neither Sarris nor 1 link had seen the 
"L'lraniie Project," "I believe that lliis is an impor- 
tant project," said Funk. 

"We can leam from this tragedy," be added. 

Sarris commented on the "diversity in 
America, and the need lo "respect regardless ol 
our religious beliefs." 

Phelps responded: "'Laramie Project' is a 
propaganda piece, he said, calling die media 
coverage ot Shepards death 'nonsensical melo- 
drama." 

"I'd throw the switch" for Shepards killers, 



pitiful gay hoy who lived in sin and died ii 

and who has 'now been in bell lor almost six and 

a half years." 

The second question, as posed by the mod- 
erator, asked "What does diet hrisijan jjjhle leach 
about homosexuality?" 

Phelps referenced (he Biblical story of So- 



"Me, a img i in Hi Mi, al verses; is del em lined linlli 
Ihiough textual and historical context,'' said 
funk, who poiiued oiu other Biblical verses that 
siippoiied his claim. 

The third i]iu'-tnin asked die debaters to re- 
spond loihe gay marriage debate. 

"1 don't th in I dial the govern inem -In mid lie 
in die business ol debiting marriage," said Sarris, 
who noted that while churches have the freedom 
lo define marriage in whatever way they would 
like, "what government has to do is extend rights., 
protect rights." 

"Same sex marriage is die ultimate insult to 
t p"i I M migbt\. ' said Phelps m his response. 

The fourth question for used on the separa- 
tion heiween legal ngbis and religious influence. 

"America is no longer good, said Phelps, 

claiming a "sod in. juggernaut" had come into 

influence. He then spoke of the Biblical book of 
Revelation, and of lesus Christ returning and 
"taking vengeance." 

"Religion influences everything we do." said 
Sarris, commenting on her own faith. "I'm here 
because of my faith." she said. 

After the pre approved questions, the mod- 
erator chose Irom audienie member quesiions. 
Questions ranged in their subjei t matter from the 
nature of sin, to the murderers ol Shepherd, to a 
question of pedophiles.

"How can the department be looking for a 
new chair if it does not advertise the position?" 
Moore said " I hey won't even let us put out a job 
advertisement.'' 

Moore complained that administrative re- 
sponsibilities are falling on faculty that are not 
lenured. and that these responsibilities deter fac- 
ulty from doing their actual jobs. 

"The Arts and Sciences department is cur- 
rently designing a position that fits the universi- 
ty's needs and resources," said Lipman. 

He said there is much research thai must be 
done before the university can advertise and in- 
terview for such an impoiiant position. Matters 
like the appropriate pa\ tin tin- position must be 
considered. And the university must decide on 



other com ems: for example, whether the search 
should he lor a female or minority administrator. 

Moore said it seems like the responsibility 
of finding a chair is being dclened, and that this 
issue of accountability raises a broader question 
about the university's commitment lo the philos- 
ophy department. 

"Aristotle tauglu dial words and actions are

forum shifted to the 
student's funding. Hubley feels 
that it is important for students 
to realize that they have a say in 
where their money goes. 

The current Vice President 
of Programming, Tony Wilson, 
was the lone positional can- 
didate in attendance. Wilson 
made note than he plans to 
spread out the funding to more 
different organizations next 
fall. 

"My theory on student 
service fees is that I want to 
fund things that will help IPFW 
organizations." said Wilson. 
Currently, Wilson is a mem- 
ber of the university allocation 
committee, who is in charge of 
handing out funding to all or- 



ganizations, including depart- 
mental organizations like CASE 
and The Writing Center. 

Erin McConaha, who has 
been the Vice President of Pro- 
gramming for three years, is the 
only current member who will 
not return in the fall. Angela 
Grabczak and Danny Epplc will 
be seeking to fill that void. 

"I want to utilize the in- 
crease of incoming freshmen in

Epple. Currently, Epplc works

No surprises at debate 



At many times during Sunday's de- 
bate between the Equal Rights Coali- 
tion and Westboro Baptist Church's Fred 
Phelps, Pastor Phelps's words were inde- 
cipherable. At times he almost muttered 
his words — completely the opposite of 
what would have been expected. 

His answers were long-winded, of- 
ten going over the allotted time. Yet the 
old fire-and-brimstone passion was only 
there in spurts. Nothing like what Ameri- 
cans have come to expect from him. 
Many times, he completely evaded the 
questions. 

For example, a question raised by 
a person in the audience asked both 
sides whether they believed that Mat- 
thew Shepard's murder Gould be justified. 



Phelps avoided the question altogether 
and brought up a story in which a 13- 
year-old boy named Jesse Dirkhising was 
"sodomized to death" by two adult gay 

Granted, Dirkhising's death went 
greatly unnoticed, and his death could 
have and should have been prevented. 
But this was not the question. 

On the contrary, on the opposing side. 
which consisted of Kathy Sarris and Dan 
Funk, the answers were easier to under- 
stand and given in a calmer, more rational 
fashion. They spoke of respecting others 
and their freedom of religion, freedom to 
marry whomever they want — whether in 
heterosexual or same-sex marriages. 

Throughout the debate, the crowd 



kept relatively quiet. Sarris and Funk 
received slightly enthusiastic applause, 
while Phelps was given the silent treat- 
ment — and the audience even quietly 
laughed at him a couple of times. 

Sarris and Funk delivered their views 
more succinctly and logically. But both 
sides maintained the rules — which con- 
sisted mainly of being respectful of each 
other in spite of the high levels of emo- 
tionalism that both sides likely felt. 

The fact of the matter remains. In 
our country, we are all given freedom of 
speech. Whether we agree with someone 
else is irrelevant. We all have a right to 
speak our minds, to be heard and to be 
treated with respect and dignity. The de- 
bate was a testimony to that. 



Letter to the Editor 



Vagina Monologues' did not 
kill feminism 



Dear Editor, 

In response to Casey at the Bat's col- 
umn (3/2/051 about the "Vagina Monologues" 
i"Mnii(i!i)gucs: feminism is dead"). I would like 
to extend my condolences to Casey and offer 
her a chance to "find" feminism alive (and well) 
again - and right here at IPFW! 

1, too, attended the 2005 performance of the 
"Vagina Monologues," but my perception of the 
evening was quite diucreiit than Casey's. Hul it's 
true... your perception is your reality. 

I left the Scottish Hue reding satisfied that 
feminism is alive and 1 was ecstatic that over 
l.jllil attendees had In en i hallcngcd hy thercali- 



The positive messages were not lost (on 
me) "in the raucous, hedonistic manner of pre- 
sentation" observed by Casey: i found them 
empowering. 

My only disappointment during die entire 
evening was in i lie sound system because I feared 
that many audience members were unable to 
clearly hear each performer! 

More than anything, I think the fact that 
Casey's and my experiences at the "Vagina 



M &gt;logiiiV weir "i \vr\ ililierent aptly dem- 
onstrates ihe point that feminists are m&gt;l all alike 
We don't all look alike and we don'l always think 
alike. Bui what we should he able to agree on is 
that violent e to atn person is unacceptable.

not in someone else's family. Mos! of the 
readers of this column know someone or 
know someone who knows someone who 
is infected with HIV 

According to the Centers for Disease 
Control, the age group 13—24 accounts for 
over 1 1 % of all new cases of HIV infection 
in the U.S.. 49% of whom are females. Sixty- 
i percent of deaths from 

h. 
from infection to death from i 
HIV, persons dying in that age range were 
infected between the ages of 12 and 32. 

A belief we often hear expressed is 
that people with HIV are infected because 
of their behavior, and therefore are get- 
ting what they deserve. Actually, nearly 
all serious health problems are linked to 
behavioral factors: heart disease, asth- 
ma, emphysema, most cancers, diabetes, 
hypertension, and obesity, to name a few. 
Johnny Carson recently died from emphy- 
sema due to cigarette smoking. 

We never once heard that anyone 
thought he got what he was asking for. 
But get an infection related to sexual or 



drug use behavior, and people get crazy. 
Why are education programs about eating 
correcdy to avoid obesity never perceived 
as encouraging overeating, but education 
programs about protection from HIV are 
thought to encourage sexual behavior? 

The best protection against HIV infec- 
tion is education. In the absence of educa- 
tion about HIV, abstinence is an unin- 
formed decision. Research has shown that 
having all the facts not only helps people to 
make decisions, but helps them to live with 
the decisions they make. 

It's why you sign an informed consent 
when you are getting a medical procedure 
or participating in research. Understanding 
all the risks and benefits help you make the 
right decision for you. If your decision is 
abstinence, then having had all the facts 
makes it an informed decision that you are 
more likely to stick with. 

There are those who say that advocat- 
ing education about HIV is implicit advo- 
cacy of promiscuity or sex outside of mar- 
riage. I seriously doubt that those oF you 
who are reading this will find yourself with 
a sudden urge lo have sex. 

Withholding information about HIV 
is not only ill advised and useless, it is 
dangerous. That makes withholding such 
information immoral. It's like getting in a 
boat and taking along the life preserver in 
case the boat capsizes. Leaving the life pre-

And what about you? What about 
those few hours of that party you can't

you sure you didn't engage in some kind 
of unsafe behavior? Are you sure the boat 
didn't capsize?

Barry Bonds and baseball steroids issue not about race

He whined thai the reason all of the con- 
troversy has centered on him lately is because 
he is a black man on the verge of breaking Babe

stems from racist attitudes. 

My message to him: What a load of bull! 
The reason all of this controversy has centered 
on him is because he is accused of using ste-

would have to be that.

was the theme of the Fort 
Wayne Philharmonic concert 
on Saturday, Feb. 19. With an 
eclectic mix of genres, this con- 
cert included some of the lesser 
known works of Stravinsky. Rota, 
Antheil and Tchaikovsky. 

Of special interest to 
the concert was Nina Rota's 
"Trombone Concerto," per- 
formed by David Cooke, trom- 
bone instructor and Community 
Orchestra conductor at IPFW 
and principle trombonist with 
the I on Wayne Philharmonic. 

Said Cooke. "Edvard 
Tchivzhel called me one eve-

players and picks who he will ask 
to perform on the next season's 
program. Usually, the soloists are 
picked and confirmed by mid- 
March... so. ..you have anywhere 
from 6 to 14 months' notice (that 
you are going to perform with 
the Philharmonic)." This was 
Cooke's fourth opportunity to 
perform with the Philharmonic. 

Although Rota is best 
known for the music he wrote 
for some 150 movies, including 
the first two "Godfather" films, 
he also wrote for the classical 
genre. Conductor Tchivzhel said 
that this concerto demonstrates 
the full spectrum of the instru- 
ment and demands great virtu- 
osity. Cooke performed this work 
with fine technique, the lyrical 
trombone melody soaring over a 
milling orchestra.

In All Directions 



Recently, a lot of print space in the 
age area has been devoted to the pending coach 
change here at IPFW and rightfully so. 

The decision that athletic director Mark 
Chancellor Michael Wartell and an advisory commit- 
tee will soon be making is perhaps the most important 
in the history of the university s athletic department. 

But sadly, a lot ol the attention has been diverted 
to who best fits the job based on credentials and what 
attention they can bring to the program. And that is 
the wrong plate lor attention to be. 

Since the release of Doug Noll in January, this pa- 
per alone has run columns supporting potential full- 
time replacements loe I'echota and I racy Dildy. And 
while 1 do feel that these two men should be front-run- 
ners for the position, I do not think that the decision 
should debased on who looks the best on paper.
