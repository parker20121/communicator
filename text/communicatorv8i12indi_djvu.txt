The bill was amendedso that (1) receiver of

reserve fund will cover the other half, (2) 
the award date of the jackets will be October 



by the University Resources Committee. 

There arc many factors to be considered. 
A study has indicated that it would take the 
average student 8 to 10 minutes to walk from 
the Northeast site to Kettler Hall. This 
might cause a problem for a few students 
and faculty; however, it is a problem which 

must be resolved on nearly every college 
campus. There is also some objection to the 
buildings being strung out like beads on a 

On the other hand, perhaps students would 
use the Student Union more often if it were 
on the way to another classroom building. 
And the lagoon site is not ideal either, 
because of the parking problem, and 
because in five years the St. Joe river will 
have dumped so much silt into the area that 
it will no longer be a lagoon. There is also a 
soil study underway, to see if the area is 
geologically sound enough for a building. 



Becker

virus 

Nobody has found a 



duclion governing, or genetic 
molecules of cells, and are pro- 
pagated as the host cells divide to 
reproduce. Becker hopes tc- 
immobilize afflicted genetic 
molecules by latching to these 
politicly charged molecules a 
negatively charged metal ion. 

A trace amount of metal ion in 
the body goes where it is needed, 
but a large amount will poision 
cells. So a special concentration 
of metal ion must be found which 
inactivates viruses and yet does 
not kill the human host. 

"Right now I'm just specu- 
lating," Becker said. He will try 
to form clearer answers when he 
sets up his lab system this 
summer. Setting up the lab will 
be tricky. "I could kill everybody 
in Fort Wayne," said Becker, "if 
I used a virus that attacks plants,

OPINION 



EDI- 
TORIAL 

Penny Carnival gives joy 

feels that the IPFW student body 
mole one of the finest annual student 
? during the school year, the annual 
Penny Carnival. 

This year's Carnival will be held Saturday, November 20, 
in the Student Union It is an annual event put on strictly for 
the benefit of Fort Wayne's younger set, namely, the 
children enrolled in the Head Start Program. 

Student organizations are permitted to set up booths in 
the Ballroom to help make the youngsters' visit to IPFW a 
memorable one, and students who participate in this 
unselfish effort are to be highly commended. 

We students spend most of our time on campus furthering 
our own selfish interests; obtaining a degree, interviewing 
for jobs, etc; no! truly interested in anything other than 
those activities which will be of benefit to Number One. 

When a person participates in a day of fun such as the 
Penny Carnival, where all activities are directed towards 
the benefit of someone else, especially a little kid, the return 
to each participant is impossible to measure. If you want to 
discover how it feels to be Santa Claus to a little kid, just 
come out to the Penny Carnival and participate. If you are 
not a member of any particular group, you can still 
participate. There are hundreds of jobs to do. and any 
student who wishes to help can do so. The looks of awe and 
gratitude you will receive from little kids really will make 
your day. 

The students at IPFW have been accused of apathy. We at 
The Communicator have written about it a number of 
times. Help to prove us wrong. There is no way to explain 
the satisfaction one receives from giving of one's self for 
others. You have to experience the "joy of giving" to truly 
appreciate it. 

A faculty dining facility?

thai there should be separate dining facilities for faculty in the 
cafeteria. 

Whose desire would he fulfil led liy I his request -the lacully or the

Some of our classrooms 
arerit classrooms. 

Military science courses are courses in leadership, management and military 
procedure. You'll learn how to manage people, to handle money and equipment. 
But you'll get more than just the classroom theory. You'll experience it. 

So when you study map reading and land navigation, be ready to get your 
boots dirty in activities like rappelHng, orienteering or river-rafting. When you 
study communications, plan on communicating. And when you study weapons, 
expect to qualify at the rifle range. 

Then, when you decide to enter advanced ROTC courses as a junior, plan on 
applying everything you've learned at a six-week summer leadership camp. 

Military science courses offer you challenges. Physical as well as mental. To 
prepare you for leadership responsibility as an Army officer when you graduate. 

If that's the kind of challenge and experience you're looking for, you're the 
kind of student we're looking for.
