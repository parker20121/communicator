Too bad, profs,

Last Wednesday after- 
noon the local brand, or the 

American Association of Uni- 
vcreity Professors unnni-. 
mously voted down a propos- 
al to allow faculty members 
to have a privileged parking 

The proposal came in 
the form of two motions. The 
first molioa, proposed by Dr. 
Hollander and seconded by 
Dr. McCants, (they were only 
acting for a professor who 
couldn't be present, and 

disclosed) wanted to reslure 
the former faculty parking

his production are Dana

Rick Bcnz, Jim Jones and 
Steve Sutton. 

A non-realistic play,

gles to discover reality. Shel- 
ly Schrngcr has the title role.

ironic situation: an aggres- 
sive white female forces n 
conservative colored man in- 
to a confrontation. Michael 
Ferrigno directs Erin Halscma 
and Tim Blaylock in this 
forceful production.

111 COMMPHICATOE 



to the editor 



Dear Editor: 

This teller is written as a 
response lo a pair of articles 
which appeared in the Novem- 
ber 30 issue of the "Communi- 
cator". The articles entitled 
"Discover All" and "Love is 
the Answer" were written by- 
some dissatisfied individual who 
identified himself (or herself) 
only as "E.E." The theme of 
the articles was a continuance 
of the constant liarragc of de- 
nunciation which has been hur- 
led at western society in gener- 
al, arid American government in 
particular, wttlt increasing fre- 
quency during the past feu 
year. "E.E.'"S remarks brought 









used to brainwash the citizens. 
"E.E." compares its operation 
to Hitlers antics. However, I 

haven't seen any gas chambers 
around here lately: when is the 
next batch oj "undesirables" 
due for extermination? 

"E.E." says that our so- 
ciety "tells us that alt good 
children follow orders without 
a flinch." fpt completely to. 
Our nation was founded by men 
and teamen who refused to take 
orders from a government they 
thought I cat bo-iirath wrong, 
and we praise their efforts. In 
fact, we commend just about 
any group of citizens who work 
to ovcrthrme tJie collar of an un- 
just regime, when they strive to 
follow the dictates of their own 
hearts, but only when they have 
a concrete, workable concept of 
what they uant in its pice. 



powering, when they have failed 
Co be moved by all other means. 
Skat "E.E." realty intended to 
say, I think, was that "The con- 
tinued misuse of technology and 
blind, baseless revolution can 
only lead us to failure." 

••Love...'"ihen concludes 
with the usual barrage of in- 
sulting remarks and inflamma- 
tory language that characteri:c 
the prattle of those who think 
something s

HOW'S YOUR HEAD? 

One or the serious problems in college and university 
lire today is the lack of attention to the personality needs 
to the students. Suicide is the second most common cause cf 
death on the campus, topped only by automobile accidents; 

but those who have studied the subject believe that half of 
the latter are --concealed suicides"; thus suicide actually 
leads the list. Dr. Howard A. Rusk or the New York univer- 
sity Medical Center collected estimates that 90.000 each year 
will threaten suicide, one in ten will make the attempt, and 
thtt there will be | .000 actual deaths resulting. Beyond this. 
he calculates that among six million students, -some 600.000 
have emotional problems for which they need professional 
assistance." The National Institute of Mental Health finds 
that "the factor of human isolation and withdrawal" appears 



to be critical; and the colleges ret 
lem created by these 'loners" and ; 
but admit (in hundreds of letters to 






nize the serious prob- 
trying to provide help 
from deans) that they

&lt;xxx&gt;ooooooooo&lt;x&gt;oooo. 



This waste of some or the n 
is intolerable. Since for every ; 
dred have felLso despera 
be thrown on the subject 
the fortunate ones to war 
going.. 

With the help of a friend who is vitally interested in 
(his subject, the American Institute of Family Relations is 
carrying out a nationwide study of what is being done and 
what could and should be done. We need to hear from as many 
students and former students as possible who have faced 
such a crisis. What pulled them out of it? Was it aid furnished 
by the college or university'or other community organiza- 
tion ?or by a friend ?or religionJor reading' Just how did they 
save themselves &gt; 

We will not publish the names of any individuals or 
schools: the information will be handled Statistically and 
anonymously'. Hopefully we have gained your attention to this 
study and now we ask for volunteers who will write their ex- 
periences to me ( personal) at The American Institute of 
Family Relations 5287 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles. Califor- 
nia 90077 it may contribute toward saving valuable lives. 

We shall certainly be most grateful for any help you can

it a recent meeting of educators, students, and state 
government officials an awesome fact was made known to 
the participants -at the meeting. The fad revealed that in the 
liig Ten. Purdue i'uiversU) and Indiana Olivers Uj rank one 
two in terms of tuition costs far student,. 

Inother illuminating statistk was spewed out the na- 
tional average tuition cost at stale universities is fill per 
year. Students at Li. -PL', pay twice the national ivcrage . 
And some high ranking university officials have hypothesized 
a tuition hike if efforts at the Stale Legislature fall lo 
squeeze out the necessary funds. 

Students arc in an economic meat grinder. The position 
of students relative to a tuition hike must be made agoni- 
zingly clear to the public. Only through an organized effort 
can this feat he accomplished. ' 

The final major endeavor of the present student govern 

ment administration is directing and leading this effort 

\ll students should immediately recognize the impor- 
tance of making km 
sequence of a raise 
they could contribute to this vital c 
olved through porlfi ipalio
