If you are a loyal reader of The 
Communicator, you have probably 
already heard that we launched our 
new website last week, which coin- 
cided with Issue 19's release. We have 
been working on this project for sev- 
eral weeks and are extremely excited 
to have finally begun this new phase 
in The Communicator's evolution. As 
the new web editor, I am looking for- 
ward to the challenges and rewards of 
maintaining what will definitely be a 
new and easier way to access our lat- 
est content. Let me quickly tell you 
about some of the features of our new 
website. 

A big chunk of the front page is 
filled by our top stories with a large ar- 
ticle slideshow being one of the main 
features of the website. On the right- 
hand side, you will see a list of upcom- 
ing events going on around campus, as 
well as links below that to information 



about hard copies ofThe Communica- 
tor. From there you can view an inter- 
active PDF version of our latest issue 
without even leaving the website. 

We are also reviving our Facebook 
fan page, as well as our Twitter feed. 
With these, we will be able bring you 
top stories and updates straight to 
your Facebook and Twitter homep- 
ages and will also provide a great plat- 
form to interact with our readers. You 
can easily become a fan on Facebook 
by going to www.facebook.com/ip-

and Twitter icons on the top-right of 
the website that will easily take you to 
the fan page and Twitter feed. 

We currently have a list of features 
that we're still working on adding and 
we are always looking for new ways to 
improve the website. If you have any 
feedback or ideas of your own, we 
would love to hear them and encour-

Secrets of art unlocked 
by professor Columbia 

Pigments based on the annatto seed 



ByAlexAxthelm 

a ii hamQ 1 e*md tnlt Ip fw. edu 

Five years ago. Chemistry 
Professor Michael Columbia 
attended a National Science 
Foundation workshop on 
chemistry and art. The NSF set 
up the workshop to increase 
the number of special topics in 
teaching. And every fall since 
2007, Columbia has offered 
CHM 120: Chemistry and Art, an 
Area II general education course. 
Columbia did not expect to 
research topics connecting 
chemistry and art, but 
discovered inexplicable 
results from some of the lab 
experiments. 

As part of his search for 
answers, Columbia has been 
studying lake pigments, which 
are used in paintings. Lake 
pigments are insoluble colorants 
developed from soluble dyes. 
This is important for artists, 
because the insoluble pigments 
are more difficult to accidentally 
remove. Lake pigments have 
been used for hundreds of years 
and are common in many old 
paintings. To precipitate, or 
lake, a pigment from a dye, the 
dye is dissolved; the dyes then 
bind to a support material, or 



substrate, which makes the 
compound insoluble. The solid, 
or precipitate, is then removed 
and dried. 

Columbia's current research 
involves analyzing pigments 
based on the annatto seed 
and attempting to chemically 
characterize the different 
colors that different substrates 
produce. For example, an iron 
substrate will give the pigment a 
red tone, while a copper base will 
give a green color. 

"Columbia's current research 
involves analyzing pigments 
based on the annatto seed..." 

The lake pigments 
Columbia studies are fugitive, 
or susceptible to fading from 
exposure to light This can cause 
paintings to deteriorate over 
time. However, if a database 
relating decomposition products 
to specific pigments can be 
assembled. art restoration 
experts will be able to determine 
which pigments an artist used. 
allowing for more accurate 
restorations. 

This summer, Columbia 
hopes to find the effects of 
light and other processes on 



decomposition of pigments 
based on the annatto seed. He 
is studying the annatto seed, 
rather than the more common 
cochineal, because it is more 
susceptible to decomposition, 
and will hopefully provide 
meaningful results over the span 
of a summer. By discovering 
methods that will destroy the 
substrate, but leave the pigment 
and decomposition products, 
Colombia hopes to develop tests 
that can be used to determine 
to products of other lake 
pigments. 

The connection between 
Science and Art has brought 
Columbia closer to the art 
community. "I currently 
am taking a drawing class," 
he remarks on his newfound 
efforts to understand the artist's 
perspective. The research he's 
working on is, "nothing I would 
have foreseen five years ago." 
However, not knowing all the 
connections between chemistry 
and art is not a problem, but 
an adventure. He is excited to 
explore the connections between 
art and science. "This whole 
course and the things that have 
come out of it have created a lot 
of new doors for me to open and 
try to see what's behind them."

Chocolate: A guilty pleasure 

The truth behind this appealing indulgence 



By Hana Al Hawash 



Chocolate- wiih ail of irs 
benefits •- is satisfying to men 
and women alike, especially 
those who are under a lot of 
stress from work and classes. 
But what it took to make that 
little bar of chocolate is more 
than you prubably care to know. 

Cote d'lvoire. a West African 
country, is the leading exporter 
of cocoa beans in the world. It 
is also home to around 200,000 
children from ages 12 to 16 
(UNICEF) that have been sold 
by traffickers that lured them 
from Mali, where they are sold 
to cocoa bean farms. In even 
less pleasant circumstances, 
desperate parents will sell their 
children in the hopes that [hey 
will get a real jab and eventually 
make a good life for themselves. 

Slavery was deemed illegal 
by the United Nations in 1994, 
but human trafficking is higher 
now than it has ever been. 
Annually, about 700,000 women 
and children are trafficked 
around the world and according 



to Anti-Slavery International, 
the revenue totals up to S7 
billion each year. 

Even though the world 
acknowledges that human 
trafficking is very much alive 
and practiced, people tend 
to ignore it. Especially in our 
cozy own country, the general 
citizen will look the other way; 
since the outlawing of slavery, 
the word is almost taboo. 
Some Americans, though, 
noticed and were outraged. 
Disturbed US senators decided 
to make an effort by adding 
an amendment to the 2001 
Agricultural Appropriations bill 
that would make it mandatory 
to mark chocolate if it was 
made in any way by child slaves; 
however, the chocolate industry 
protested. They said it would 
most likely make matters worse; 
people would boycott, leading 
to the suffering farms losing 
even more money, making the 
work conditions under which 
slaves work even worse. 

But do not fret; your guilty 
pleasure does not have to make 
you feel guilty for exploiting 



children. There is something 
called "Slave-Free" chocolate 
which is produced under theFair 
Trade terms. Under Fair Trade, 
consumers agree to pay above- 
market prices for products 
such as chocolate, coffee and 
sugar. The extra money goes 
toward helping small farms 
and co-operatives who in turn 
make improvements to their 
companies and communities. 
The buyers of Fair Trade 
products usually end up selling 
them in other countries where 
they can be labeled as "Fair 
Trade Certified." Mars, Hershey 
and NesUe are some examples 
of companies that do not work 
with FairTrade. 

So next time you need to dive 
into the rich, intoxicating taste 
of this undisputedly appealing 
indulgence, but do not want 
it to be made by a 12 year old 
that has been working under 
horrifying work conditions all 
day, try organic brands such 
as Green &amp; Black. Divine or 
Newman's Own, which can 
be found in most health food

Smoke Hut Diaries 



By Robin Crowell 

roblnyou r g ra»eO gnui l.tocn 

We are more than half way 
through February and already 
I'm burned out. I've been 
swallowed whole by everything 
surrounding work and school 
and quite frankly, I'm walking 
like a zombie through it all. What 
1 really want to do at this point is 
crawl into a hole and not come 
up out of it until the beginning 
of May when finals are over. But, 
wc all know Groundhog Day 
came and went and I'm not a 
groundhog. I'm a bird. So, alas, 
I'm stuck perched in my four 
legged table-top nest nearly 
every day or I'm swooping to the 
ground to assist customers from 
my other nest... a cash register. 

My blood somehow still 
pumping and my sockless feet 
somehow not frostbitten just yet, 
I press on. I've come to realize 
something quite funny about 
lengthy work days and lengthy 
classes. You know... those 
classes that run over an hour 
and fifteen minutes. The ones 



that are either worth more than 
three credit hours or the ones 
that only meet once a week that 
never seem to end? Yeah, those. 
Most of the time the instructors 
offer a ten or fifteen minute 
break toward the middle of the 
class meeting. I, being a smoker, 
utilize those precious minutes to 
break outside while I can and 
puff down as much tobacco as 
my lungs can handle. When I 
was a waitress I would take five 
minute breaks here and there to 
go outside and smoke. I never 
thought anything of it but today 
I was having a conversation with 
myself and began to ponder 
something. 

What in the hell do 
nonsmokers do with these 
breaks (the ones during classes, 
anyway)? I can understand 
running to a soda machine or 
grabbing a snack, maybe going 
to the bathroom, something 
along those lines. Something 
like that, though, takes no 
longer than five minutes. What 
happens to the other ten? I know 
that when I waltz back in from 




my break, reeking of smoke, 
I'm usually greeted to an array 
of seated students (the ones 
who weren't outside smoking 
with me) poised and ready to 
continue the lecture. 

When 1 was a waitress, the 
nonsmokers didn't even get 
the luxury of these five minute 
cigarette interjections. In 

a world where smokers are 
constantly persecuted, or so it 
seems, it seems that at least in 
the restaurant industry... we are 
almost privileged. 

So, nonsmokers, if you 
choose to step outside of the box 
and read this column designated 
for smoking and smoking 
culture, please feel free to drop 
me an e-mail and inform me 
of what happens during your 
breaks. I know ifs miniscule 
and almost silly, but honestly 
I'm very curious about this. And, 
bitter nonsmoking waitresses 
who never got their random five 
minute breaks, feel free to tell 
me how much you hate smokers 
for their endless opportunities at 
breaking for that nicotine fix.

Legends are definitely born everyday, but few 
people can say they were able to see their potential 
before they have risen. loe "Wild, Wild" Wuest aka 
Kanye Wuest is one of those legends. Playing guitar in 
the band, You And The Sun, Joe demonstrates a great 
amount of talent and heart. You would never expect it 
though. By day you might just see him as the political 
science major who looks like an ambercrombie 
model, but he plays hardcore music! Its an unfair 
advantage. Are we making these kids in labs now? 

I walk in on him doing the dishes and after he drys 
off his hands, we proceed with the interview. The 
dorm is what you can imagine a soon to be legend to 
live in. It smells like Ramen, a Step Brothers dvd lays 
next to the play station along with two guitars beside 
the wall. His girlfriend brings him ice cream with 
crumbled birthday cake sprinkled in and we start 
talking about his last show. "It was my second favorite 
show ever", he says, talking about ecently playing at 
a house party with his finally reunited band. I was 
in attendence that night. The band had not played 
together since last summer, if I can remember 
correctly, but you would not have known it. The fans 
in die crowd still knew every word, jumping up and 
down, pushing and shoving, hopefully being blessed 
with a chance to yell into the microphone when it 
was handed out. This was a moment and I fell in love 
with music all over again. 

Starting back in 8'" grade, due to an obsession 
with The Beatles, Joe found his way into a posi- 
hardcore band. Acting as co-lyrics writer and band 
manager, his talent on guitar and movie star looks 
steal the show everytime. I ask him what his favorite 
bands are, and after a break to talk to his roomate 
Matt about whether or not the penguins on animal 
planet were kings or emperors, he decides on Brand 
New and Sky Eats Airplane. 

Another thing to note is that his roomate is in a 
band called Ptrahna. There is a family tree of bands 
which includes Pirahna, Bearhug, You And The Sun. 



and The Ghost Claps, loe keeps his friends near and 
dear. He tells me he tries to focus his lyrics on "friends, 
staying above the negativity, and living your life." 

loe's band, You And The Sun, will next be playing 
at Cherished Again along with The Ghost Claps, 
Wooden Satelites, Mannequin Angels, and Dressed 
For The Weather on February 26 th . On request, Joe 
would like to end this story by saying, "I'll break these 
chains IPFW!" Yes you will Joe. Yes you will. 




Should you have a strategy when you 
are interested in someone new? 



By Hana and Devin 






Legends are Born Everyday 

Joe Wuest and his band, You and The Sun 



Devin: These days, you have to flirt Tor two 
weeks, casually get her number, wait three days, 
and then talk to her without letting her know you 
like them or she will get put off by you. 1 wish I 
could be straight forward and honest and say, 
"Hey, you're are really nice and fun to be around, 
I would like to get to know you better," but that 
never works. If I ever meet that person, I would 
definitely ask her for her number, but I will not be 
surprised if I get turned down. 



Hana: It does sometimes. You just have to 
find the right person. I have found that most 
people are scared. Whether it be of a type of 
person, ethnicity, body type, looks or even just 
personality. And some people are simply afraid of 
nitling, even if it's just a date or hanging nut, 



Devin: So maybe a game plan is a good idea? 

Hana: I think that is why people are more 
comfortable if you pretend you don't like them. 
If someone is saying they like you and want to 
spend time with you right off the bat; that can be 
scary. 

Devin: I hate the phrase, "having game," 
because I do not think you should play a "game" 
in this situation, but maybe it is inevitable. 

Hana: But in the end, I believe that the 
right person with the right qualities for you will 
appreciate your being straight with them because 
' ley probably like you too. 



Devin: Good point. 

Hana: 1 have a friend that asked his girlfriend 
out after two times hanging out. Granted, it was 
a really special connection that happened really 
quickly and neither of them really knows why. hut 
he was still up-front about really liking her. She 
is the type that hates committing to things and 
has never really been in real relationships before 
this, but after being let down by jerk after jerk, the 
honesty and commitment was refreshing. 



Devin: Ok. So it depends on who you are 
dealing with as to whether you should have a 
strategy or not. 

Hana: I think so, but 1 think the connection is 
more important. If you have spent time with the 
person, you can kind of tell. If it's a right off the 
bat sort of thing, you might just have to take your 
chances. 

Devin: Well that sounds good to me madam. I 
will inform the rest of the gentlemen in the world 
of what you have said.

OPINION 



P. 5 



For the love of traveling Horoscopes 




By Hana AI Hawash 

haruhjHashOyjhoo.tom 

Starling this week, I will be discuss- 
ing parts of the world that are slightly 
more accessible, mostly sites in the US. 
This week, we will talk to Malt Fields, 
who lives in Washington and attends 
Seattle University. This was our conver- 
sation: 

1) Where do you live? I attend Se- 
attle University which is in the Capitol 
Hill district of the city. Every day, I take 
an hour long ferry ride both ways from 
Bremerton, WA (where 1 technically 
"live") to Downtown Seatde. 

2) Were you bom there? If not, talk 
a little about where you were bom and 
why you moved. I was bom in Keflavik, 
Iceland. My parents were both involved 
in the navy and we moved to Bremer- 
ton when I was still rather young. Ice- 
land is in my blood and it has always 
felt like home to me, I hope to move 
back someday. 

3) What do you like most about 
your hornet own /current town? I love 
Seattle for its overabundance of culture, 
leftist positioning and fascinating peo- 
ple. Probably as the result of spending 
my early years in a country of 300,000 
people I tend to get rather anxious if 1 
spend too much time in the city. I love 
Bremerton because 1 can fall asleep at 
night in the quaint solitude that is only 
found nesded deep amongst the ever- 
green trees. 

4) What do you and other college 
aged people do In your town? Unfor- 
tunately my hectic commute has kept 
me from getting too acquainted with 



my fellow students at Seattle Univer- 
sity, 1 am not totally sure what they do 
for fun. In Bremerton people my age do 
meth and go to lousy casinos, so obvi- 
ously I do not associate with too many 
of them. My close friends are scattered 
all over Washington State and are al- 
most all members of the local extreme 
metal community. We like to create 
music as well as book, manage, play 
and attend shows. 

5) Comparing to Indiana, are the 
people generally welcoming and 
friendly? Unfortunately 1 have never 
been to Indiana, so I am not equipped 
to make a proper judgment on the mat- 
ter. I will say the general openness of 
Seattle residents is rather noteworthy. 

6) What Is the atmosphere/cli- 
mate/terraln like? The climate of 
Seattle as you have probably always 
known is generally rainy and gray. The 
temperature likes to hover around the 
40-60 range and it is hard to look too 
far in any direction without seeing tall 
green trees. 

7} If I or any college student was 
to visit you and we could do anything 
you had In mind, what would our day/ 
night be like? Anybody who came to 
visit me in Seattle would get a thorough 
tour of Capitol Hill. The area seems 
rather exemplary when you don't 
spend everyday there. There are more 
interesting shops, kooky landmarks 
and shockingly amusing posters then 
you can shake a stick at. 

8) Where Is the best place to eat? I 
am rather fond of this grubby little Fish 
n' Chips shop I discovered the other 
day. Deep fried seafood, seasoned 
French fries and Pabst Blue Ribbon on 
tap; it doesn't get any more Seattle then 
that. 

9) Do people use the public trans- 
portation or docs everyone that owns 
a car drive It? Transportation options 
in Seattle are abundant. 1 know people 
who drive, I know people who bus, I 
know people who bike and I know peo- 
ple who walk, I am personally partial to 
walking myself, on average I trek about 
four miles a day. 

10) Any other cool facts aboulyour 
town/state? Bremerton: L Ron Hub- 
bard grew up and wrote his early works 
here. Nobody ever mentions this, 
probably because they fear the town 
becoming a Mecca for Scientologists. 
Seattle: Search it up, the whole town is 
one cool fact.

LEO ( July 23-Aug 22) Compromise if you wish to 
have any fun at all. Socially, you need a fast paced form 
of entertainment. You may have been trying to do too

can't change anything anyway. 

VIRGO (Aug. 23 -Sept. 23) Controversial subjects should

rather insecure when you're not in sight. Your support and 
concern will help. 

PISCES (Feb. 20-Mar. 20) You need to distance yourself 
from the situation for a little while first You can win points 
with children if you take the time to show interest in their

Craig Atterbery 




By Holly Gallaway 

go KhaO I Oitgd en IUpFw.edu 

Despite enough of an interest in music to have a DJ 
company, Craig Atterberry is a graphic design major. His 
interest in art and computers began in high school. Like 
many high school students, Atterberry took computer 
classes during all Tour years. During those classes, 
Atterberry and his classmates spent time learning basic 
computer programs. Atterberry also spent his free time 
in the computer room, "learning and trying new things." 
He also took a few art classes, furthering his interest 
in outside art. Atterberry wishes he had more time to 
devote to his outside artwork. He would like to be more 
involved with art around town or even here on campus. 
He does, however, work on as many personal art projects 
as he can, simply when he has the spare time. He's always 
been interested in art, but he doesn't "have the steady 
hands for fine arts," so he turned to graphic design. 

"The computer is where 1 can bring out what is in 
my head," Atterberry says. He also wants to continue 
working on outside art projects for himself, for the joy 
.of it, and for any other reason he can come up with. He 
wants- to -improvo his-artistic skills. Atterberry started 
at Ohio State University in 2005 after graudating from 
leffferson High School. He didn't remain there long, but 
while he was there he was pursuing a general studies 
degree. After transferring to IPFW, his love for Ohio State 
sports was still strong. In other words, he is a diehard 
Buckeyes fan. His dorm walls are covered with 
Ohio State memorabilia, including pennants, 
license plates, pictures of football players 
past and present, artwork, and anything 
else one could possibly imagine. 

Atterberry's DJ I "^^ \ ** ; 

company, Mixx Audio 
Entertainment, is 



Ohio; his home state. He and one other person, Matt 
Bullinger, are the two owners and disc jockeys. The 
company serves Northwestern Ohio and Northeastern 
Indiana. According to their website, they seem to 
be generating quite a reputable business. These two 
businessmen have many extremely positive testimonials 
on their website, including the mention of a game called 
"Shoelyweds* This may prove that Atterberry's creativity 
can come out in circumstances other than art and 
graphic design. 

Like many IPFW students aspire to, Atterberry wants 
to get out of the Fort Wayne area after graduating. With 
only one more year to go, he's starting to really think 
about what he wants to do with his degree. After high 
school, he entered college and began to learn the design 
side of computers and "I was instantly hooked," he 
says. He enjoys graphic design because he likes having 
"the ability to manipulate things and use various ways 
to advertise and put together a layout for a client.." 
Eventually, Atterberry would like to move west and 
become involved in a corporatin, if possible. "If that 
doesn't happen, I want to move into an agency 
and eventually start up my 
own company."

SIGH NO MORE 



Artist: Mumford and Sons 

Album; Sigh No More 

Label: Glass Note 

Release Date: February 16, 2010 

Sounds Like: Celtic/ Folk

Though Sigh No More is their first 
album released, it sounds like Mumford

The title track and also the opening 
to the album starts on a note similar 
to the introduction of Brand New's 
release Deja Entendu. It is the very 
slight instrumentation at the beginning 
with vocals in the spotlight, eventually 
building up to the full band playing, 
that provides almost an outline for

EurydiceiThe 



By Kaitlyn Lucas 



The opening sequence came off as a couple of kids 
dancing around, it wasn't quite apparent what the 
ensemble was for, other than to have more people 
dancing, but they did okay. Eurydice and Orpheus. 
though? They came across as a couple of junior high 
kids in puppy-love. I was asked a few minutes into the 
play by an audience member. "Is this supposed to be 
like The Little Mermaid?" Both freshman, Dawson and 
Keller have been in other plays here at IPFW, as well as 
many other plays around Ft. Wayne for Dawson, and 
some at her high school for Keller. 

Now, experience shows. While Dawson may have 
extensive experience, his character must have been 
written a little weak. He came across well, but some of 
his lines and actions didn't seem to fit the story line. 
Keller, who has also appeared in Urinetown. seemed 
to be a titch nervous during the opening scene. She 
rubbed one line, but towards the end of the play, did 
remarkably well. Her interactions with her father, 
played by Reuben Albaugh, were quite emotional. You 
could see the love the father still had for his daughter. 

One must not overlook the compelling portrayal 
of Hades, Lord of the Underworld, by Mr. Michael 
Bartkiewicz. His above world character, a slickand sly 
devil, was quite humorous, and interesting, to watch. 
His underworld portrayal of the tricycle'riding child 
may bea bit more humorous. When his characteris told 
he is short, he responds, "I grow down, like a turnip."

the tracks seem to follow this type of 
framework but for this band it works 
much 10 their advantage. 

The singer's voice sounds hopeful, 
yet shaky and at times insecure in 
what he is saying. However, when the 
music builds and the wild banjo so 
greatly executed in this album comes 
to a head, the singer may as well be 
preaching his words from the top of a 
mountain. 

Mumford and Sons seem to 
integrate unconventional musical 
stylings in a fashion that does not 
i inn-- off as campy or ridiculous, and 
though banjo is one of the greater 
showcased instruments in this album, 
it stays away from being country in any 
way really. 

Sigh No More is truly one of those 
albums that is easy on the ears, epic in 
the subtlest yet most powerful of ways. 



Artist: Snuggle! 

Album: Zero Real Hearts 

Label; 1-2-3-4 Go! 

Release Date: February 2, 2010 

Sounds Like: Gritty, fun punk rock. 

Rating: 4/5 



By the name of the band alone, 
Snuggle! is obviously a band that 
simply loves to have fun with their 
1 music with nothing at all to prove. 

It begins wiili a track entitled 
"Heartbeat" which ironically enough 
executes pure adrenaline. It is sloppy 
punk rock in a tight, seamless kind of 
way. The bass is exemplary and as the 
song continues, all the listener can 
think to do is dance. 

As the album continues, a listener 
with a fine tuned ear and well enough 



versed in the recent history of punk 
minders of early Alkaline 
Trio and Off With Their Heads can be 
heard in the percussion, especially in 
the tracks "Bum" and "lust Another 
Party?." 

Another really interesting aspect of 
this album is the fact that on different 
tracks, different instruments are 
showcased in their own unique ways. 
Some songs pay closer attention to 
bass, some closer to percussion, some 
on the crunchy and sometimes sloppy 
guitar riffs, and the vocalist is so shaky 
at times that it's not even unpleasant; 
it's charming. 

For something new, fun, exciting, 
and fresh, dig Snuggle!. They are one of 
those bands to walk along completely 
by surprise, but the surprise is 
welcome.

He seemed to carry the most weight in scenes between 
himself and Eurydice. His performance in Eurydice 
was much akin, though better, than his performance 
in Urinetown. 

The Stones were an interesting addition. They 
seemed to be an adaptation of the Erinyes, or the 
Furies. Remarkably dressed, the Stones were my 
favorites. Played by Amanda Prater (Big Stone), 
Melauic Lubs (Little Stone) and Heather Moser (Loud 
Stone), they told us what was and wasn't allowed in the 
Underworld. Fathers, crying, singing, and pens are not 
allowed. Being a Stone, and speaking the language of 
the Stones is. 

In the legend, Orpheus plays such sad music that 
the gods weep and tell him to go to the Underworld 
and retrieve Eurydice- In one version of the legend, he 
plays his sad music to Hades and Persephone, and they 
weep. In another, he plays a lyre to put Cerberus, one 
of my favorite three headed dogs, to sleep. After both, 
he is granted his wish to bring Eurydice back with him, 
on the condition that he doesn't look back at her, no 
matter what. But just as they reach the Gates of Hell, 
and see sunshine, he looks, back, and poof, she is gone 
forever. 

In the legend, Orpheus does not die, but in the play, 
he does. We see him coming out of the raining elevator, 
and seeing the note that Eurydice wrote to him, but too 
late, he has already been dipped in the River Styx and 
made to forget everything about being alive. His death, 
while tragic, shows his devotion to his wife, Eurydice. 
But also a bit stupid, because he cannot rememberher. 
Nor she him. I think if he had realized this, he might 



not have died, and then he could have lived on in a 
depressed sort of way with his memories. 

On a whole, I wouldn't go see ii again. The modern 
adaptation seemed to ruin the legend a bit. If they had 
portrayed the story in a setting more akin to its time I 
period, it may have been more interesting. But don't I 
take my word for it, I'm just saying ii

STUDENT ISSUES 



Fertilizer in the Lake| 

Local environmental issue creates waves 



Green 
Story 



By Kelly McLendon 

mdt ndon. M ly t.' jm a 1 1 com 

Going to the lake is typically not as- 
sociated with thick, mossy green, con- 
taminated water. On the contrary, the 
summer lake experience is supposed 
to be filled with mostly natural looking 
blue waters, with a hint of stepping on 
seaweed near the shore. But the usual 
American lake event soon could in- 
clude a different color of water. 

For many years, farmers have been 
using pesticides and fertilizers that 
make their way into the natural water 
systems by something called surface 
run-off. It happens when soil becomes 
full of excess water and it flows over the 
land and into places like stormwater 
drains. This has happened in Steuben 
County, mostly due to fertilizer con- 
taining phosphorus finding its way into 
the lakes. 

The county recently lost an ordi- 
nance that banned the use of lawn fer- 
tilizers containing phosphorus. This 
means the natural lakes may soon look 
a lot greener than they should because 



the fertilizers they attempted to ban 
are responsible for algae growths that 
turn the water a different shade. 

The ordinance passed in 2007, but 
is being taken away now because the 
State Chemist Office has the higher au- 
thority regarding such rules. 

The Indiana State Chemist makes 
agricultural laws with the goal of "the 
protection of our environment," ac- 
cording to their website. After review- 
ing Steuben County's claims, "the State 
Chemist accepts the science presented 
by the Petitioners in support of the ar- 
gument that phosphorus in aquatic 
environments is generally regarded as 
a limiting nutrient.'' the legal brief said. 
However, the ban was ruled unenforce- 
able, due to the fact that, "evidence was 
lacking in their argument." Ironically, 
the legal brief was printed on "recycled 
paper," proving that the State Chemist 
cares about other environmental is- 
sues, just not the water supply. 

The State Chemist said educating 
people not to use fertilizers containing 
phosphorus was a better alternative 
to a ban, even though the Indiana Soil 



and Water Conservation District says 
that, "one pound of phosphorous can 
produce 10,000 pounds of wet weeds 
and algae." a Steuben Lakes Council 
newsletter said. 

In the February 10 issue of The 
News-Sentinel, it was reported that 
Steuben County Commissioner Ron 
Smith said he believed the Office "re- 
jected the county's request for a waiver 
for its ban because approving it would 
have set a precedent, opening the door 
for other counties to follow with their 
own laws." 

But other counties have followed 
with their own laws. lust not in the 
state of Indiana, yet. 

Take Westchester, New York for ex- 
ample. In May 2009, the county's legis- 
lators voted to ban phosphate contain- 
ing fertilizers, "after a state task force 
prompted concern about phosphates 
contributing to the growth of algae, 
which can lead to polluted waterways, 
including those that supply local drink- 
ing water," an article in The New York 
Times stated. 

Extra amounts of phosphorus and 



nitrates will not just change the water 
color, they will also harm aquatic life 
because the water will be deprived of 
oxygen, a state task force involved with 
the Westchester case found. 

"Nitrate and phosphate pollution 
eventually makes its way into major 
bodies of water in and around West- 
chester, including the New York City 
watershed, which supplies water to 
more than 85 percent of Westchester 
residents," the Times article said. 

Another reason why the State 
Chemist Office refused to approve the 
claim had to do with the ban being dif- 
ficult to enforce. Other communities 
have a solution to this issue, however. 
People caught using the fertilizer were 
given fines ranging from $50-$150 in 
other counties outside the state. 

Overall, it seems the' mission of the 
State Chemist Office is flawed. Perhaps 
they do not want people to vacation at 
lakes anymore since they are willing to 
sacrifice the environmental sanctity of 
a natural environment in favor of an 
"abide by the rules" demeanor that will 
dirty the lakes and kill the fish. 



IPSGA prepares for spring elections 



By Manuel Bernal 



The IPFW Student Government Association, IP- 
SGA, is currently in the process of preparing for the 
upcoming elections in the spring. The student gov- 
ernment elections are typically held during spring 
fling week in April. Executive postions include Stu- 
dent Body President, Vice President of Legislation, 
Vice President of Finance and Vice President of Pro- 
gramming. Each poition corresponds with certain 
obligations) the Student Body President is respon- 
sible for examining the various activities of the other 
branches, the legislative branch is in charge of col- 
lecting funds, which are later dispersed for student 



events, the programming branch (student activities 
board) puts together musical acts, lecturers, and 
guest speakers for IPFW alumni to enjoy, and the fi- 
nal branch of the student government. 

"The student government 
elections are typically held 
during spring fling week" 



Requirements for candidate eligibility include a 
cumulative 2.0 GPA, student enrollment of at least six 
credit hours and 127 student signatures on their IP- 



SGA candidate petition form all of which, are due by 
March 26. "Every branch has their obligations, some 
of my duties include coordinating senate meetings, 
writing bills, and organizing funds" said KodyTinnel, 
Vice President of Legislation. 

IPSGA utilizes several different methods to pro- 
mote the elections they include interpersonal en- 
counters, as well as, social networking. "Usually we 
set up at all the buildings, Kettler, Classroom Medi- 
cal, the Science Building, and Neff Hall" said Tinnel. 
He also mentioned that in the last couple years, can- 
didates have used Facebook groups to get the word 
out. "I know this year we are using Twitter, as well as, 
Youtube, where anyone will be able to view our fo- 
rums."

The Real Coach Carter 




By Logan Pea 

ptaltOI : ludt n is. ip f» edu 



"To be successful, you just have to be willing to 
do things other people aren't willing to do. Simple as 
that. Us not that complicated." 

These are the words that famous basketball Coach 
Ken Carter opened an interview with Tuesday, Febru- 
ary, 16, before he spoke at 1PFW. Coach Carter was 
made famous as a basketball Coach at Richmond 
High School in a very dangerous and high-crime area 
in California. 

He took a basketball program that was close to the 
worst in the slate, and turned them into state cham- 
pions. He is best known for the "great lockout" when 
his team had not met Coach's grade requirements. 
Coach Carter locked the gym, and the team spent 
over a week in the library in order to send a message 
and get the "student" back in student-athlete. The 
team was undefeated, but during the lockout, two big 
games were forfeited. 

During the interview, Coach Carter was asked 
how much soul searching he had to do to make the 
decision to close the gym. "It was easy; it was very 
easy, because no one expected us to be undefeated 
anyway" he said with a chuckle. "They thought we'd 
be a last place team just like previous years, before 
I became coach, but we started having success aca- 
demically before we started having success on the 
basketball court." 

When asked how it felt to be successful, the driven 

and humble coach explained how he looked at his 

success. "I still don't think I'm successful; I still don't 

_ consider myself successful. This is just part of the 

Photo Courtesy of GeorgeFox.edu journey. See, I have goals, 200 things on a list, and 



after I accomplish something, I'll cross it off. And 
you know, after 1 cross something off, I add some- 
thing else. I always have 200 things on that list. Con- 
stantly. So I'll never get to the end of that list. I think 
that's what you call a bucket list, when you have these 
things, and you cross them all off, and now it's time 
to just die. Well it's been proven some people live to 
be thousands of years old. 1 would like to be one of 
those people. It's all about just reaching your full po- 
tential," said coach. 

Many people wonder about what Coach Carter's 
former players think about him: they wonder what 
kind of people they turn into. "You know that is what 
is great about them, because I tell people all the time 
that I'll know how good of a coach I've been after a 
player has left me for 10-15 years. You look at their 
lives, and they're extremely successful. I mean the 
way that they live their lives. 1 think we try to get 
a well-rounded person. A lot of people like to get 
straight A's and that's fine. I have no problem with 
that, but I like a well-rounded person; someone who 
is a member of different clubs, and who plays in the 
band, going out and doing community work. That's 
the well rounded kid that 1 like. And you know we 
don't have too many millionaires, but we have a lot of 
thousand-aires though!" 

The last thing I wanted to know from Coach Carter 
was just one word. I wanted the one word that could 
summarize his time at Richmond and he simply said, 
"Awesome, period." 

As a player, you know basketball is the hook, 
but education is always the goal. With this, the great 
lockout, this is the only lockout in history where ev- 
erybody won. The student-athlete won, the school 
won, the coaching staff won, but most of all, our 
community won.

gular season

asketball 



Starla Williams

By Logan Pea 



In a season that has had its highs, like aZack 
Plackemeier game winning shot at die buzzer 
(twice) or Anne Bosse setting shooting records, 
the season has also had its rough spots; heart- 
breaking overtime loses, or ice cold shoot- 
ing nights. Now though, one tiling is for sure: 
the regular season is over and everyone has a 
clean slate: both the Men's and Women's bas- 
ketball teams are in great position for a Sum- 
mit League Conference tournament run. This 
can lead to something that neither team has 
accomplished in their short history: the NCAA 
tournament. The big dance. The tournament 
every kid dreams of. 

The Men's and Women's teams concluded 
their last double header weekend on Satur- 
lay, where the women's team had an ice cold 
looting night that was countered by a pleth- 
ora of three pointers rained in by South Dakota 
The women's team dropped the bout 
'6-65. The men's team on the other hand had 
themselves a fantastic night shooting the ball 
as they put away South Dakota State 78-72. 
The Men's and Women's Summit League Tour- 
naments get underway March 6 in Sioux Falls, 
South Dakota, and it is yet to be determined 
,ho the teams will play.

prayers go out to her family and friends at 
this difficult, difficult time."
