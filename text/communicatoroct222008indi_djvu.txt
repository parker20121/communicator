While the pageant consists of the typical 
phases, such as interviews, an evening wear 
and swimsuit segment, and a talent portion, 
the program's co-director. Shelley Bass, says 
that the Miss IPFW competition in particu- 
lar is trying to embrace a more diverse group 
of young women, casting out the idea thai 
only the stereotypical "beauty queen" can win, 
"We are looking for a realistic girl." Bass said. 
"A winner should be someone who is relevant 
to people in her age group. She needs charisma. 
A winner has the ability to walk into a room and 
command it."

McKee agrees that 
confidence ovemiies 
beauty in a contest such 
as Miss [PFW, "Looks and 
the gown do play a part, 
but if you donl have the 
personality, you're not 
going lo win," she said. 
"The judges are looking 
for someone who is real 
and down to earth." 

The competition in- 
volves a piece that allows 
judges to see beyond the 



material aspects of the 
contestants and get in 
touch with thai person- 
ality: a platform. This 
consists of an important 
topic in any area that the 
contestant feels passion- 
ate about, can discuss, 
and can work with in the 
future. 

McKee focused on 
abuse. "IMy platform) 
is Abuse Awareness in 
Schools and in Homes," 



she said. "I want to help 
children and adults who 
have been abused to get 
through their situations 
and grow because of it. 
Being abused often leads 
to depression and feeling 
like everything is your 
fault, but if a person can 
learn that it isn't their 
fault, they can grow to be 
a better person, escape 
their abuse, and eventu- 
ally help other people do 



the same.' 

Bass stresses that the 
competition has sev- 
eral benefits for those 
who lake part. "We as 
directors go beyond just 
looks,' she said. "This is 
an opportunity lo grow, 
build interview skills, 
show talents, and gain 
confidence. Most of all, 
this is a great way to earn 
scholarship money." 
Bass states that the Miss 



America program is the 
nation's largest contribu- 
tor 10 women's scholar- 
ships. 

McKee reinforces the 
rewards of participat- 
ing in this competition. 
"I am more confident in 
myself, I have a much 
higher self-respect, and 
best of all, 1 [made] new 
friends." she said. "No 
matter how [she] places, 
a girl can't help but feel 



good about herself and 
the accomplishment of 
ha\ing the courage to go 
up on that stage in fi-ont 
of all |of| those people 
and show off |her| talents 
and |her| personality. 

It lakes a lot to go up 
there and be judged, and 
if a girl can get thrau^ 
that, [shcj can get 
through much more." 



Awareness is key to 
ending world hunger 



By Kelly McLendon 

staff Wfller 



According to the 
BBC. "there are 923 mil- 
lion undernourished 
people in the world." 
Knowing that statistic, 
It's easy to pinpoint the 
myriad reasons why. 

Waste 

Food is obviously 
wasted at a rather alarm - 
ingrate.TlieUnivereityof 
Arizona Garbage Project 
reported that Americans 
toss nearly 475 pounds 
of food every year. Most 
of tlie thrown away food, 
if nonperishable, could 
go to a community or- 
ganization to benefit 
someone else. Take, for 
example, tlie average res- 
taurant. Nightly, they loss 
bags and bags of uneaten 
food into a brown Waste 
Management container. 

The discarded din- 
ners won't compost well, 
so they end up sitting 
in a landfill, rotting for 
a very long time. These 
details are important 
when the fact that the 
USDA saj-s, "if just 5 per- 
cent of Americans' food 
scraps were recovered, 
it would represent one 
day's worth of food for 4 
million people," is taken 



into consideration. 
One can look as close 

as Fort Wayne area res- 
taurants and they'll see 
theimmensewaste.Some 
doughnut shops make 
too many doughnuts 
and when not enough 
are bought by the end of 
the night, they are placed 
in a garbage bag. Some 
of the supposedly "old" 
doughnuts will be taken 
to various rescue mis- 
sion locations through- 
out the city, whereas oth- 
ers end up in the trash. 
Such practices leave 
one to wonder if such 
waste is really necessary. 



cies for food produc- 
tion immediately," said 
The International Her- 
ald TVibune, the global 
equivalent of The New 
York Times, Prospective 
changes in operating 
policy include, "'how to 
produce food that is less 
dependent on fossil fu- 
els; favors locally avail- 
able resources, natural 
fertilizers and traditional 
seeds; and tries to pre- 
serve the soil and water 
supply." 

Agriculture has a long 
way to go if it hopes to 
thwart or at the very 
least, reduce excessive 



"The lack of food on 
shelves of food banks is a 
problem in the state 
of Indiana, too." 



Overproduction 

Too much food is be- 
ing produced in some 
areas and not enough in 
others. The United Na- 
tions holds sustainable 
development sumnuts 
to attempt to counteract 
unnecessary production. 

The United Nations 
believes countries who 
are major agricultural 
producers must change 
their operadng poli- 



produciion. 

The lack of federal 
resources and allocated 
money going to those 
who truly need it most is 
also another reason why 
many are undernour- 
ished. Many food banks 
are experiencing empty 
shelves, after govern- 
ment aid was reduced 
this year. They can"i seem 
to keep up with the de- 
mand. Food banks in 



New York have been de- 
nied half of their federal 
aid funding, resulting in 
situations where some 
organizations have had 
to actually turn people 
away. 

The lack of food on 
shelves of food banks is 
a problem in the state of 
Indiana, too. 

Pam Allmeyer, who 
is president of Gleaners 
Food Bank in Indianap- 
olis, said in the India- 
napolis Star '"poverty in 
Central Indiana was as 
bad as she's seen in her 
28 years in the organiza- 
tion." Gleaners makes a 
point to convey that even 
the middle class is hav- 
ing a difficult time keep- 
ing up with the increased 
food prices and that all 
types of people may find 
themselves needing the 
assistance of a commu- 
nity food bank. 

"America's hungry 
are more than "street 
people" you see carrying 
torn trash bags bulging 
with aluminum cans or 
pushing shopping carts 
half filled with some- 
body's discarded cloth- 
ing. This country's hun- 
gry are also the elderly... 
the working poor.. .single 
parent households... and 
children" notes Gleaners 
website.

Mental Health Day 
spreads knowledge, 
adivce to students 



By Kelly McLendon 

staff Writer 



The first floor of Walb 
Union seemed lo be 
full all day on Thursday 
October 9, with people 
flooding in to obtain in- 
formation about mental 
wellness, it was the an- 
nual "Mental Health Day, 
which featured vendors 
from various community 
organi2ations. 

In addition to receiv- 
ing free information and 
food, attendees also had 
the opportunity lo get 
screened for depression. 
Each screening consist- 
ed of a two page survey, 
followed by a short, five 
minute analysis of the re- 
sults with one of IPFW's 
personal counselors. 

The community orga- 
nization tables displayed 
a plethora of information 
about relieving stress, 
working out at Gates 
Center, getdng help for 
depression and eating 
healthier. Free pens and 
notepads were also given 
away. Additionally, one 
table offered samples 
of soymilk and another 
had interesting looking 
healthy wraps. 

Free massages were 
offered; although, if you 
didn't sign up early, most 
of the slots were filled by 
the afternoon. 

Mental health well- 



ness is especially im- 
portant in college, when 
stress is paramount. Fa- 
tigue, insomnia, frequent 
illness and increased 
boredom arc all signs of 
stress. 

Mental Health Day 
also showcased three 
seminars, including a 
riveting a panel discus- 
sion. "Alcohol and the 
College Campus: Can the 
TWo Mbc Responsibly?" 
by Campus Ministry. 

While the day was an 
excellent way for people 
in the community to ob- 
tain information about 
getting help, there is also 
a permanent site on- 
campus designed to as- 
sist students that many 
may not be aware of. 

The IPFW/ Parkview 
Student Assistance pro- 
gram offers many servic- 
es to students." Services 
include individual coun- 
seling, group counsel- 
ing, couples counseling, 
consultation, workshops 
and referrals to outside 
agencies. These services 
are provided on the IPFW 
campus for student con- 
venience. There is no 
cost to students or their 
families." according to 
the program website. 

Students interested 
in talking with someone 
more about mental well- 
ness issues can call the 
Student Assistance Pro- 
gram at 260-373-8060 or

Tricks in treating yourself to a costume in Fort Wayne 



By Mark Cox 



Many would ven- 
lure thai the spiraling 
economy would have an 
adverse effecl on Hal- 
loween, a holiday of dis- 
playing childhood idio- 
syncrasies and a fourth 
of the yearly candy sales 
— all while spending 
hefty amounts of money 
on a costumes and mis- 
cellaneous decorations. 
Although signs point to 
skimpy spending by con- 
sumers wanting to cel- 



ebrate the holiday, this 
year it is projected by 
the National Retail Fed- 
eration that Americans 
are expected to spend 
S6.9 billion this year. 

Halloween greatly 
contributes to the econ- 
omy by the creation 
of around 40,000 jobs, 
which produce over 
S12 billion in product 
each year — that counts 
for a lot of cavities! This 
year's sales are expected 
to hit S2.08 million, a 
two percent increase 
from 2004. 



■people are willing to 
splurge and spend a 
lot of money on items 
that make them happy." 
said Cory Scott, Fresh- 
man Computer Science 
major. "I think it kind of 
eases the worries people 
have about the economy 
and how it is affecting all 
of us." 

Halloween stores in 
the last couple months 
have been sprouting up 
around Fort Wayne, as 
well as many large store 
chains rolling out the 
holiday decorations, cos- 



tumes, and other miscel- 
laneous spook accesso- 
ries. Michaels Arts and 
Crafts is currently run- 
ning a Halloween Blow- 
out sale through October 
25, with discounis of up 
to 60 percent off on dec- 
orations. Hobby Lobby 
has simitar sales as well. 
Local Halloween 
stores feature hundreds 
of costumes in all sizes, 
shapes, and prices, such 
as Halloween USA at 
Glenbrook Square Mall 
and Halloween Express 
at Jefferson Pointe Shop- 



ping Center. The starting 
price of a full costume at 
these specialty costume

IPFW is an attractive 
campus by most stan- 
dards. We have plenty 
of trees, well kepi build- 
ings, and a great loca- 
tion right next to the St. 
Joseph River. But there 
is always room for im- 
provement. Every year 
your student govern- 
ment has the ability to 



implement a campus en- 
hancement project. The 
money can be used for 
functional things such as 
new sidewalks and bench- 
es Co things that are more 
aesthetic such as deco- 
rative graphics on bare 
walls. 

The money for these 
projects comes from the 
student government re- 
serve account, which is 
made up of unspent mon- 
ey from past annual bud- 



lor for Financial Affairs. 
Past projects include the 
sidewalk that goes from 
campus all the way to the 
Canterbury Green apart- 
ments and the new furni- 
ture and television set in 
the lounge of the Class- 
room Medical Building. 

We are always open 
to new ideas for proj- 
ects. Perhaps there is an 
awkward patch of land in 
need of some flowers. Or 
maybe a certain outside 



area doesn't quite have 
enough seating for stu- 
dents wishing to study in 
the nice weather. Possi- 
bly some students might 
not enjoy the horribly 
outdated furnishings 
and dficor of Walb Stu- 
dent Union. These are 
just a few random ideas 
for possible improve- 
ments to the campus, yet 
we are willing to pursue 
just about anything that 
is reasonable, affordable, 
and feasible. 

For those interested 
in finding more infor- 
mation about campus 
enhancement projects 



you can contact myself 
(stupres@ipfw.edu) or 
someone else from the 
student government of- 
fice. If you just have a 
random idea to throw 
out you can also utilize 
the obnoxious blue sug- 
gestion boxes around 
campus. I look forward 
to getting new and cre- 
ative ideas from the stu- 
dent body. 



Michelle Obama hits up Fort Wayne 



By Dan Jehl 

StaH Writer 

With less than 3 weeks 
to go, Michelle Obama 
is down to less than 30 
more campaign stops 
across the country before 
the final day of voting on 
November 4. She made 
Fort Wayne one of these 
stops on October 15. 

Supporters didn't let 
down the wife of Demo- 
crat Sen. Barack Obama 
and the current poll-lead- 
er as America's choice to 
be the next First Lady. 
That very day, Fort 
Wayne's share of Sarah 
Palin tickets for her In- 
dianapolis rally on Octo- 
ber 17 were given out in 
a matter of hours. The 
Republican Vice-Presi- 
dent Candidate Palin 
rally drew over 24,000 at 
(he Indianapolis Verizon 
Dome. 

These two campaign 
rallies may be the last for 
Indiana for the election 
for president and vice- 
president of the United 
States. 

On Wednesday, Oc- 
tober 15, at 8:30 a.m.. 5 
houtB before the rally at 
the Grand Wayne Center, 



Chad Larimore, a Mun- 
cie resident, showed 
up winning the honor 
of "first one there." He 
came "to hear what Mi- 
chelle has to say." And 
Larimore said he plans 
to do the same with 
Vice-President Candi- 
date Sarah Palin in Indi- 
anapolis two days later. 

The "nol-sure-yets" 
were not the norm. The 
ne.xl group lo arrive at 
the Grand Wayne were 
Fort Wayne Obama sup- 
porters demonstrated 
by Obama gear. The 
nearly 2,000 attending 
the Michelle Obama ral- 
ly were mostly Obama 
supporters whether it 
be Michelle or Barack. 

Michelle Obama, 
the crowd's choice to 
be the countries next 
First Lady, spoke in Fort 
Wayne for the second 
lime in 2008. She spoke 
for the Obama Cam- 
paign for America on 
April 25 at North Side 
High School 

At 1:30 p.m., Mi- 
chelle Obama crossed 
the stage waging to sup- 
porters behind her and 
then faced the crowd 
expressing a spontane- 



ous "wow, 'seemingly sur- 
prised at the big numbers 
before her. 

Her two Fort Wayne 
speeches were similar to 
remarks, aiso said at her 
April speech, included 
stories of her and Barack's 
upbringing in Chicago, the 
importance of her family, 
and the need for change 
in America. New mate- 
rial included such com- 
ments as "the campaign 
is personal," since polices 
affect her, her family, and 
American lives. 

Crediting her husband, 
she said: "Barack has got 
us 85% of the way there. 
Now it's on us." Her final 
words were a rallying cry 
"Yes we can." 



After the speech, the 
crowd's hope for First 
Lady shook hands with 
enthusiastic. camenj- 
flashingsupporters,somt' 
sporting IPFW shiris. She 
then was husded to the 
downtoivn Obama Cam- 
paign for Change Head- 
quarters for an interview 
with CBS Co-Anchor 
Maggie Rodriguez for the 
next day's "Good Morn- 
ing America." 

Some left the Grand 
Wayne seeking direc- 
tions to the City-County 
Building to vote. "Why 
wait? Let's go vote," said 
one, and chances are it 
will be a vote for Barack 
Obama — or maybe for 
Michelle Obama.

TOO.' 

ACE you A 



By Craig Lloyd 

Writer 



What do you think 
about when you hear 
ihe phrase "computer 
store"? You might thinl( 
of a place thai Cries to 
suck every dollar out of 
you lo repair or service 
your computer. You also 
might picture sales as- 
sociates breathing down 
your neck, trying lo get 
you to buy this great new 
piece of software, or even 
bribe you to purchase 
their great new comput- 
er. This isn't the case for 
a local Fon Wayne com- 
puter store I visited just a 
few days ago. 

Build A Computer 
uses a different approach 
when dealing with their 
customers; they spe- 
cialize purely in build- 
ing custom PCs. Here's 
the catch, (wait for it....) 
the customer builds the 
computer, not the store. 



Why? "We do this to in- 
form people that assem- 
bling a computer isn't as 
hard as others believe it 
to be," says Greg Flow- 
ers, President of Build 
A Ciomputer. "It's a very 
simple process." 

The customer speci- 
fies exacdy what they 
want to do with ihe 
PC and they can even 
pick out the exact parts 
themselves if they so 
choose. Build A Com- 
puter then orders the 
parts, which takes about 
aweek, and the custom- 
er comes back lo leam 
how to build their very 
own, custom built PC. 

All of this sounds 
great, but most people 
will ask, "Why spend 
all this time building a 
computer when 1 can 
just buy an HP or Dell 
right off the shelf?" 
There are numerous 
reasons why custom 
building your own PC 
is a great idea. You get 



greater performance at a 
lower cost, belter quality 
components, no useless 
software, and most im- 
portantly, the satisfaction 
that you've built your 
very own PC (believe me, 
it's a great feeling). 

The guys over al Build 
A Computer will leach 
you everything you need 
lo know, and guide you 
through the building 
process. Greg Flowers is 
[he President of Build A 
Computer and has been 
in the IT business for 
over 30 years. Greg, along 
with lustin Flowers, the 
Support Technician, will 
show you what it takes 
to crafi your own media 
masterpiece. "This is a 
one-of-a-kind business," 
says Greg. 'No one else 
does this.' 

To receive more in- 
formation about Build A 
Computer, you can call 
them at (260) 432-4717 
or visit their location at 
5746 Conventry Lane.

What would Hallow-

be pretty much just be a

Here in Fori Wayne, the 
Haunted Castle and Black 
Forest are a scary option 
that many people can 
take advaningo of It is 
on the corner of Auburn 
and Wallcn Road here in 
Fort Wayne. For $7.00. a 
person can walk through 
the haunted castle and 
explore a wooded area 
loaded with scares. Visit 
www. haunted castle, com 
for more information.

known Haunlcd Cave.

Voting Early 



By Dan Jehl 

StjflWntcr 

Indiana Is one of only 
31 slates aJlowed in early 
voting. 

In Allen County, vot- 
ing early takes place at 
the City-County Building 
downtown Fon Wayne. 
You can vote Monday- 
Wednesday- Friday from 
8-5:00 p.m., Tliesday and 
Thursday from 8-7:00 
p.m., or on Saturdays 
from 9-4:00 p.m. 

If you are registered, 
all you need is an Indi- 
ana photo ID. Even if 
your address is not cur- 
rent, you can still vote 
and then head to the 
Voter Registration office 
in the sajne building and 
update your address. 

There are 4,4 million 
Hoosiers registered, an 
all-time record. Voter 
turnout is expected to 
break all the old records, 
with more than 3.500 
early walk-in voters in 
Fon Wayne from the start 
on October 6 through 
Friday, October 17. Poll 
workers said many were 
college students spotting 
their college shirts. 

The ballot Is fivc-and- 
a-half pages long. It may 
seem like a curve ball, 
but it's multiple choice, 
and students are used to 
that. The catch is there 
are more multiple choic- 
es than what one may 
expect. And your ballot 
may not be the same as 
the next person's. 



Depending on where 
you live, you will be giv- 
en your ballot for your 
school board candidates 
(if any), your Indiana 
State Assembly and Sen- 
ate candidates, and a 
referendum question on 
retaining township as- 
sessor offices, and even 
questions on whether to 
retain cenain judges de- 
pending on your vodng 
address. 

For Allen County, 
there are 39 different bal- 
lots depending on v^ere 
you live. There are no 
sample ballots to "study" 
at the City County Build- 
ing. You can cram to vote 
by peeking at a ballot on- 
line with a visit to www. 



to spend a few minutes 
making decisions. 

For President, there is 
Democratic Sen. Obama, 
Republican Sen. McCain, 
and Bob Barr for the lih- 
enarian Party. 

For Governor, there is 
incumbent Republican 
Governor Mitch Danieb. 
Democratic candidate 
Jill Long Thompson, Lib- 
ertarian candidate Andy 
floming. 

For U.S. Congress- 
man of Indiana's Dis- 
trict 3, which includes 
IPFW, Fon Wayne, and 
Allen County, there is 
incumbent Republi- 
can Congressman Mark 
Souder, Democratic chal- 
lenger Mike Montagano, 



"For Allen County, there are 39 

different ballots depending on 

where you live." 



co.allen.in.us - a click 
on "Services and Elected 
Officials," and a click on 
Elections Board. All bal- 
lots are there in Adobe, 
and there are directions 
on how to find yours. 
Good luck with that. 

If you want to vote a 
straight Democratic or 
Republican ticket, just do 
it. Voting a straight ticket 
does in fact include your 
party's choice for presi- 
dent. This is the fast- 
est way, or be prepared 



and Wilham Larsen, Lib- 
ertarian Party candidate. 

Don't feel uninformed 
if you don't know the rest 
of these candidates. Few 
people do, but we get to 
vote anyway. 

For Superintendent 
of Public Instruction, it's 
Republican Tony Bennett 
and Democrat Richard 
Wood. For Attorney Gen- 
eral, it's Democrat Linda 
Pence and Republican 
Greg Zoeller.

Women strong on the block in loss to lUPUl 



Despite playing withoui Ihcir season 
leaders in kills and assists, the IPFW 
Masiodons had a record blocking 
match against the lUPUl laguars; 
however, it was nut enough, as the 
Dons fell 3-2 (26-2-1. 20-25. 25-20. 26- 
28, I5'10l, dropping the team to 11-10 
overall and 6-3 in The Summit League 
action, 

IPPAf loialed 23 team blocks, the 
first time since the NCAA adopted rally 
scoring in 2001 that a Masiodon team 
has recorded 20 or more blocks, Kylcc 
Hervey's 1 3 blocks broke previous 
single-match record of 12 set by Claire 
fackson against Belmont on September 
23, 2005. Maya Schlindwein ended the 



match with 1 1 blocks, while Shannon 
Reuier and Taryn Parker each finished 
with eight. 

Missing from the IPFW lineup was 
kill leader Rebekah Boehm and assist 
leader Jessica Dominiak, as the team 
used a trio of attackers, Ashley Dillon. 
Jessica Miller and Schlindwein to 
pick up the offensive slack. Dillon 
tied a career-high with 17 kills, while 
Miller's 16 kills was a season-high, with 
Schlindwein chipping in 14. one off of 
her season-high. 

Jamie Schwartz led four 'Dons in 
double figure digs with 19, as Miller, 
Dillon, and Renter chipped in 18, 17, 
and 13, respectively. Dillon led the 



team with a pair of service aces, as 
Reuter dished out 47 assists in her third 
straight start, as the junior missed a 
triple-double by just two blocks. 

In the opening set. IPFW jumped 
ahead early, and led by as many as 
six at 19-13 following a laguar attack 
error, forcing the hosts to use their 
final timeout of the opening frame. The 
break was beneficial for lUPUl, as they 
rallied to score four straight points, 
cutting the dehcii to two at 19-17. After 
a 3-0 IPFW run pushed the visitors' 
lead to three at 23-20. and within sight 
of set point, lUPUI once again rallied, 
scoring six of the final seven points lo 
claim the 26-24 opening set victory. 



IPFW used a 2-0 and 4-0 run in the 
early stages of the second set to jump 
ahead 8-4, as the 'Dons would not trail 
until lUPUl scored two straight points 
to take a 14- 13 lead. 

In the fifth set. IPf^ jumped aliead 
3-1, before the hosts ran off three 
separate 2-0 runs to take a 7-5 lend. The 
Masiodons would cut the deficit to one 
five more times, including as late as 1 1 - 
10, before the Jaguars ended the match 
by scoring the final four points in the 
15-lOfifthseiwin. 

lUPUl, the NCAA leader in digs, had 
four players reach double figures in the 
statistic, with two more at nine, as the 
team totaled 88 in the five-set victory.

line. 

The freshman duo of Alexandra Paul (22:47.45 - 
9Clh) and Sarah Hutchings (22:50,54 ■ 102nd) placed 
ihird and fourth for the 'Dons. Their limes were sev- 
enth and eighth best on the Ail-Time performance 
list. 

Sophomore Felicia Mondry ran the fifth best time 
for the Mastodons at 23:35.28 good for 149th. 
As a team, IPFW tied with Oklahoma for 14th place 




out of 39 teams in the event. 

The Mastodons outdistanced Summit League foes

Andrew Young (37:22.59 - 178th) rounded out the 
Top-5 for the Dons, 

IPFW Head Cross Country Coach Mike Fruchey 
was pleased with his team's effort, "I thought both 
the men and the women ran extremely hard today. 
There were many great efforts out there, I am really 
excited about the upcoming conference meet and 
our continued development as a team. " 

IPFW iviil finish off the 2008 season at The Summit 
League Cross Country Championships on November 
1 in Shrevepon, Louisiana. 



Men's Tennis wraps up fall season 
with competition at ITA Regional 



The IPFW men's tennis team 
competed Thursday and Friday 
in Columbus, Ohio, at the ITA 
Midwest Regional. The five day, 
single ehminaiion competition 
featured many of the top college 
tennis players in the Midwest. 

The singles competition was 
held on Thursday, and IPFW 
had two players competing in 
the quailing round. Despite 
impressive play from both players, 
neither Mastodon advanced into 
the second round. Freshman 
Robeno Cabrini lost to Sebastian 
Lj-stad (Illinois- Chicago) 6-4, 3- 
6. 6-3, while senior Hermann 
Kuschke was defeated by Julian 
Dehn (Minnesota) 6-1. 6-4. 

Inthedoublescompetition.IPFW 
sent I^vo teams to the qualifying 
round. Unfortunately for IPFW. 
both teams were ousted in the 
first round on Friday. Dwyer'Haal 
(Iowa) defeated Francisco Sigaud 
and Felipe Gama (IPFW) 6-3, and 



Bemabe/Monroy (N. Illinois) 
ousted Hermann Kuschke and 
Robeno Cabrini (IPFW) 8-5. 

Coach Eric Burns had this to 
say following the men's singles 
matches: 

"The day went pretty well overall, 
unfortunately we couldn't get our 
first win in school history at this 
event today in the singles. Both 
players had tough match- ups, but 
every match is tough at this event. 
These are the best players in the 
region. Roberto played very well 
and his match was high quality 
tennis-great points for both 
players. Unfortunately, he came 
up a linle shon at the end. but I 
think with more experience it is a 
match he can pull out." 

"Hermann got off to a rough 
start in the first set, but he battled 
hard and had lots of chances in 
the second set," Bums added. "He 
just couldn't quite pull out the 
second set, but it was a positive 



improvement from his last few 
matches and his first set today. 
Both guys represented IPFW well 
and gave a good effort." 

The ITA Regional was the final 
event of the fall for the mens 
tennis team. Dual matches uill 
begin in 2009, starting with 
Western Michigan in Kalamazoo, 
Michigan, on January 18. 

The Mastodons will have just 
two seniors on their roster when 
Spring acdon begins in Keschke 
and David Lynall. 

They will look for (Cabrini, a 
freshman to put forth a surong 
effort. Cabrini is one of four 
Brazilian natives on the roster, 
including two freshmen. 

The team will not play at home 
again until February 8 when the\' 
kick off a twenty day home span 
with Toledo. 

Their first Summit League match 
will be on March 27 against South 
Daluita State in lUlsa. Oklahoma.
