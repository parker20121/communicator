Accounting 
Society 
provides tax 
assistance 



Since Feb. 12 of Ihis year, free tan help has 
been available 10 members of Ihe Fbn Wayne 
communily In Kelller Hall Room IDS. members 
of Ihe Accouniing Society, through parlictpalion 
in Ihe Internal Revenue Service's V^lunlect 
Income Tai Assislnnl (VITA) Program, will be 
offering free lax help on Mondays between 1 p.m. 
and 4 p.m., until April 9, with ihe exception of 
March 5, 

"The VITA program has been formed due to 
Ihe recognition Ihal lat laws are so complex and 
Ihat an cfTon like dial was necessary, ll is a way 
for Ihe IRS lo appear very friendly, an nliempi to 
help taxpayers comply with lax return, and claim 
bcncllis such as tax credits," said Jim Locbl. fac- 
ulty adviser lo Accouniing Society Students and 
assistant professor of accounting and finance. 

According to Taxpayer Education Spccialisi 
and Cooidinalor of Ihe VITA Program in Indiana. 
Carolyn Sanders, Ihis is a nationwide program 
founded in l%9. 

tt is located in all states where volunteers 
arc trained lo help taxpayers with theii income 
lax returns, especially those with low income and 
the elderly. Most volunteers are retired profes- 
sionals and college students. Many companies 
allow their employees lo help, Sanders added. 

Sanders also menlioned Ihat Ihe VITA pco- 
giam focuses on federal and stale returns, and 
thai the altcndance rale is at its peak from the end 
of January lo mid February. 

"We do a lot of advenisemem each year 
Mostly people who can nol afford lo spend a lot 
of money look for this free service. The number 
o( volunteers keeps increasing. Last year, about 
70,000 volunteers offered free lax assistance." 
Sanders said. 

Approiimalcly 35 million people a year 
rccieve free lai help from VITA program volun- 
teers Nationwide the VITA program is targeted 
toward lower income taxpayers who qualify for 
earned income credit (a minimum of S3.ESE in 
earned income crediis is available in 2001 lo tax- 
payers with two qualifying childrenl. The IRS 
also hopes lo reach taxpayers eligible for the 
Child Tax Crcdil of S500 per child and the cred- 
its desigtKd to assist taxpayers with Ihe costs of 
higher education, the HOPE Credit, and ihe 
Lifeline Learning Credit. 

Al nrW. taxpayers can prepare their feder- 
al and Slate income tax returns with help from Ihc 
students. Assistance in completing forms 1040- 
EZ. l040A.or IfUOand accompanying schedules 
on which capital gains tD) and itemized deduc- 
tions (Schedule A) musi be reported, is 
being provided. 

However. a.uislance to taxpayers with more 
complicated returns may be unavailable." We do 
limil Ihe kind of returns we do bciiause we have 
students help rather Ihan professional lax prepar- 
ers. Returns must ooi be complicated, involve 
income from rental property or interest in sub- 
chapters corporal ions," Locbl. said.

LRC lets down students, staff 



The Learning Resource Center (LRC) 

Hclmkc Libraiy in Room 37, supplies the univer- 
sity with a variety of media services. One of 
Ihose services includes providing students wiih 
Ihc necessary tools lo supplement Iheir class 
projects. Some members of our stoff have had 
experiences in which the LRC failed 10 deliver 
requested equipment lo the classroom. 

The media and technology suppon services 
sector of LRC provides audio-visual equipment 
for general classrooms on ihe IPFW campus and 
for conference rooms scheduled by Walb 
Memorial Union, according to John Fitzgerald, 
diiccior of the LRC. 

Fitzgerald said that theie are no charges 

mil materials provided lo regularly scheduled 
classes taught on campus. External users are 
charged Ihe prevailing commercial rate for tenul 
of such equipment and labor, including overtime 
for operators of equipment. The LRC maintains 
an inventory of over 1.500 pieces of equipment, 
ranging from the simple (easels. Hipcharlsj to the 
complex Icompulers. LCD projectors). There are 
Dpproiimaiely ISO-200 requests per normal class 
day for classroom instructional technology. 

The LRC prefers that requests for equip- 
ment be made Iwo ' - ■ - 

ofrequesls.Adale. 
should be included in ihc 
ume of requests and sta 
requests can m 



Fitzgerald. According lo Ihe LRC's website 
lhtip:/'www.ipfwedu/lrc/suppon.hlm). there ore 
four methods in which a requesi for a device can 
be made: in person in Helmkc B37. by phone at 
4g|-6JI9, by email al http://www'.licschcdul 
inB@iptw.edu or by fax at 481-6587. 

Faculty requests tor classroom instructional 
technology receive priority over sludcnl requests 
Therefore, optimum service can be acquired f 
students ask professors to request Ihe equipment 
on Iheir behalf, according lo Filzgerald 
Professors also can have LRC deliver and pick 
up the equipment and arrange for an operator to 

If this option is not available to a student 
then ihe next best thing is lo make a lechnology 
requesi via email, Fitzgerald said, by taking Ih s 
course, recipients of Ihe materials will have a 
copy of Ihe request on record. Il is also helpful 
for initialing future requests. However, students 
should lake into considenition that the message 
may not go through. They also should remember 
to provide all Ihe pertinent informalii&gt;n previous 
ly mentioned. 

Some of us wish that we would have known 
Ihis information in its entirety when we made our 
lequests for a computer with power point. We 
chose to inform Ihe LRC of our needs by person- 




All of our efforts e c 
selves or our fellow students 
with power point capability. We had lo 
LRC to check on our request, only lo i 
thai there was no record. Consequently, i 
forced to pull together an impromptu 



ally going into Iheir offices iw 
and providing our last names, r

oi nothing that could bcdon&lt; 



visual aids as best we could on the chalk- 
board. Luckily, our professor understood and our 
fellow students helped facilitate a discussion 
wilh their opinions on the topic. 

We believe thai the most heinous aspect of 
this siiua lion wis die apparent lack of concern for 



dc I neil to answer our question about 
i.i.&lt;mpcnsJiion for a sludenl when a request isn't 
filled. Our only suggestion is thai sludenls make 
their requests via mote than one media and Ihal 
ihey keep a copy of those requests. We alto 
would suggest filing complaints wilh diedireclor.

Earnhardt helped to popularize 
NASCAR in Ihc early -90s with the help of 
newcomers such as J erf Cordon. 

Senior Tejai Patel remembered 
Eart\hardl. *He was ^ery good at striking a 
balance between winning and driving safely.* 

Eiamhaidl will be lemembcred always 
by those fans who loved him and admiied 
him. The IntJmidalor' didn't seem to intim- 
idate fans; Ihc fans were drawn to him and lo 

EainhardI will be remembered for much 
more than just being a NASCAR driver his 
life, his skills, his abilities. He had a way 
wilh fans, making them feel drawn to him. 
He wot personable, yet he was a superstar. 
He was a superstar, yet found time lo give 
back lo Ihe fans. 

Through the good times and the rocky 
Lmes, 'The Tnlimidalor" remains forever 
unchanged. 

For all Ihe memories. Mr. Earnhardt.
