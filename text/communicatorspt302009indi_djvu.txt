Drummond speaks about IPFW arabic 



By Peter Schnellenberger 

uJinpjOl (Mtudenti iptw tclu 



On September 16, The 
Communicator reported about a 
group of students called "Save IPFW 
Arabic!" banding together in an effort 
to create an undergraduate degree in 
Arabic language and culture studies. 

Soon after the article was released, 
the chair of English and Linguistics 
sent a message announcing that 
there would be a third year of Arabic 



(and Chinese) offered to the students 
currently enrolled in the courses. 
Originally there were only two years 
being offered. There will also be a first 
year class offered next fall. 

"I'm ecstatic!" said Lauren Hughey, 
creator of "Save IPFW Arabic!" 

According to Carl Drummond. Dean 
of the College of Arts and Sciences, 
the Arabic and Chinese courses are 
two components of a pilot program 
known as the High School Strategic 
Language Institute. This project was 
made possible by a funding request 



from Mark Souder. U.S. Congressman, undergraduate degree because of a

strategic languages would be offered "Committing to a full

Peace may never come 
to the Middle East o P Ed 



By Frank Yonkof 



li was probably no surprise to any- 
one Lhis week when Middle East peace 
talks with President Barack Obama 
yielded no notable results. 

Many people had anticipated see- 
ing some glimmer of hope as leaders 
from around the world are in town to 
address the United Nations General As- 
sembly. 

As I watched Wolf Blitzei interview 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netan- 
yahu in the Situation Room, I couldn't 
help bui think of the famous Israeli 
/ Palestinian handshake in front of 
President Bill Clinton. Then my mind 
shifted io the attempted reenactment 
by President George W. Bush. 

Then I thought of how many more 
iconic peace photos we will see before 
we get real results. Would Obama have 
one? What about his successor? 

As I thought about these questions, 
Blitzcr tuned in from the background 
and brought up the random topic on 
Jerusalem, and Netanyahu did his best 
to sidestep it. 

"I think the fact that ( Jerusalem has) 
been united under Israeli sovereignty 
lias ensured that, for the last four de- 
cades, all major faiths, Christianity, 
Islam and Judaism, all monotheistic 
faiths, have enjoyed the great freedom 
ofworship and access to their religious 
sites," said the prime minister. "Some- 
thing (hat hasn't happened before 
.since tlieriseof the ihrce monotheistic 
religions." 

I agreed. 

But then I noticed the same old 
rhetoric began to spring up. 

"Israel was rocketed, pummeled for 
eight years by thousands of rockets tliat 
came from Gaza. . . I mean, what would 
you do if thousands of rockets fell on . . 
.any part of the United States?" 

In all fairness, the Palestinians have 
perfected their own talking points, and 



it seems tike rhetoric is the main obsta- 
cle in this debate. 

As an American who isn't particu- 
larly passionate about supporting ei- 
ther side, I think the problem lies in 
getting accurate information. Because 
the United States is deeply involved in 
the negotiations and shares in what- 
ever consequences are reaped, it is ex- 
tremely important to know what is go- 
ing on. 

But where do you get facts that are 
not weighted down with bias or pro- 
paganda? It is almost impossible for 
people like me to get information with- 
out having to factor in the "Israeli view" 
and the "Palestinian view.* 

Although I pray there will be peace 
one day, I am not very hopeful. As 
my grandfather used to put it, "Those 
peoplejust love to fight." Which is true. 
For thousands of years, that region has 
been absorbed in conflict and chaos. 

"Even in the aftermath of the 

Clinton handshake of 1993, 

the Israeli prime minister was 

assasinated by a fellow Israeli..." 



Do we have any reason to believe peace 
will finally come in the next decade? 

In reality, both the Palestinian and 
Israeli camps have hard-line support- 
ers who are unwilling to budge, which 
poses major problems for their leaders 
when it comes time to negotiate. Even 
in ihu aficrmath of the famous Clinlon 
handshake of 1993. the Israeli prime 
minister was assassinated by a fellow 
Israeli who was upset by the negotia- 

While I honestly believe most Israeli 
and Palestinian people want peace. 
I also believe their cultures have a 
certain mindset that has been influ- 
enced by generations of fighting. So it 
is impossible to believe either side will 
change that mindset anytime soon. 



Student loans go public, 
Rep. Souder weighs in 



By Peter Schnellenberger 

ichnfij01Vinidcnu.lprw.titu 



One of world's most precious 
resources does not usually get the 
recognition that it truly deserves. 
Teachers are often the forgotten and 
unsung heroes who make the world 
function; without teachers, sociery 
would crumble. 

One IPFW professor was recently 
given a reprieve from this unfortunate 
problem, both for her contributions to 
academia and to society as a whole. 

Stella C. Batagiannis, Ph.D., has 
more than 30 years of experience in 
teaching and educational leadership 
with K- 12 education. She has a 
professional background ranging 
from English education to serving as 
superintendent in two Indiana school 
districts. 

Batagiannis, an assistant professor 
of educational leadership at IPFW, 
was one of the few educators who 
were granted the Teacher of Honor 
designation by Kappa Delta Pi, 
the International Honor Society in 
Education.

College students are graduating 
with more debt than ever before, 
but a new bill recently passed in the 
I imi-i hopes to alleviate the financial 
burdens students face and improve the 
education system. 

The Student Aid and Fiscal 
Responsibility Act, or H.R. 3221, will 
essentially cut out the "middle man" 
from federal student loan programs. 
As of July 1.2010, students can borrow 
directly from the federal government in 
the Direct Loan Program. 

A key element of this bill is that it 
intends to make Pell grants easier and 
less expensive for students to receive. 
Pell grants are often the foundation of a 
student's financial aid package. 

This is a significant change in the 
system, as direct government lending 
in the last academic year accounted for 
about a quarter of federal loan volume. 

According to the Committee on 
Education and Labor, the Direct Loan 
program is entirely insulated from 
market swings and can guarantee 
students access to low-cost federal 
college loans. 

This bill will end the practice of the 
federal government subsidizing loans 
financed by private companies, the 
Congressional Budget Office estimates 
that ending these subsidies would free

the very special colleagues in the 
Educational Leadership Program, the 
School of Education, and IPFW. who 
always have something to teach me." 
said Batagiannis. 



up more than $80 billion over 10 years. 

This bill passed in the House 253- 
171, with ten abstaining. Mark Souder. 
U.S. Representative of Indiana's third 
district, voted against this hill and 
argues thai the new system will not save 
money and Is "pure deficit spending." 

"The way they're actually covering 
|lhe progr.mil is taking it jmoneyl 
directly from the government without 
the normal interbank lending rate 
which takes it from one government 
account and transfers it to another," 
Souder said. 

According to the Committee on 
Education and Labor, the private 
industry will not be completely forced 
out of the system, as the bill will 
establish a competitive bidding process 
that allows the U.S. Department of 
Education to select lenders based on 
how well they serve borrowers, provide 
financial literacy counseling and 
prevent loan defaults. 

The results of this legislation will 
not be illuminated immediately, and 
the debates surrounding this overhaul 
do not show signs of ceasing. 

"The way the system changed 
bad nothing to do with the students. 
I believe it was much better going 
through the private system than the 
public system," Souder said, "I believe 
in effect what we just did in this hill is 
we transferred money Io the university 
system, not to the students." 



Womanizing is a mark 
of immaturity opEd 



Batagiannis named 
Teacher of Honor 




By Greg Stowers 



For some reason un- 
beknownst to me, there 
happens to be a stigma 
placed on many young 
men of my generation; 
a stigma which assumes 
we are only focused on 
sex and how to achieve 
such ends. 

I see it in the eyes of 
women I spark conver- 
sation with as they as- 
sume they can see right 
through me and for a 
time they would have 
been correct. 

I was never one to 
approach a woman by 
whispering tales of giv- 
ing her the world; I was 
honest, utilizing my tact 
and charm, as opposed 
to silly pickup lines. 

The sad state of the 
conversations of many 
other guys made me 
seem like a breath of 
fresh air and like a typi- 
cal guy, I took advantage, 
differing from the norm 
using pure common 

Pursuing or talking 
to a woman never called 
for a plan or agenda, just 
honesty and versatility. 

For the longest, it was 
fun and I met a plethora 



of women from all differ- 
ent walks of life who in- 
directly helped me devel- 
op into who I am today. 

However, I met some 
who had an extremely 
negative effect on my 
dealings with women. 

Telling your best 
friend to call you scream- 
ing about a made-up 
emergency because you 
need to get away from a 
fanatical woman is not 
cool. 

In a conversation 
with my mother a while 
ago, I realized the error 
in my vicarious and dra- 
ma-filled lifestyle. It was 
clever and sarcastic and 
she probably doesn't re- 
member it, but she said 
in response to meeting a 
girl, "So how long is she 
going to be around?" 

I laughed it off, but 
when I got home I sat 
down and did some soul 
searching. 

I would always tell 
myself, I'm young and 
need a wide variety of ex- 
periences, so that when 
I look back I have no re- 
grets. 

But, at what cost? 

For the most part, 
regardless of the situa- 
tion, women of my past 
would say I'm a good 



guy, but recognizing the 
pain which I caused is a 
symbol of growth and ac- 
knowledgement, but it is 
also disheartening. 

Conforming to soci- 
etal norms and enter- 
taining clueless women 
based solely on superfi- 
ciality as opposed to sub- 
stance is ignorant, and it 
can serve as an impedi- 
ment to any young man's 
progress. 

Realizing such things 
makes a bar or house full 
of young women, scant- 
ily clad, without a plan 
for the future, a lot less 
interesting. 

To those of us out 
here who taxe advan- 
tage of others guys' lack 
of substance, as we grow 
older we realize we're 
only hurting ourselves. 

I used to want all (he 
girls from a variety of 
standpoints, but as I've 
matured I've realized the 
necessity in having just 
one, one who both rec- 
ognizes and understands 
the importance of com- 
plementing my intellect 
and challenging me to 
follow my ambitions and 
dreams. 

I only hope my 
growth manifests itself in 
myyounger peeis.

October 2. This does re- 
quire a bit of work on our 
pan, but not much at all. 

Conversion in most 
cases takes five minutes 
or less; however, it may 
take longer for students 
who have set up multiple 
folders. 

"Conversion was 

easy, I just had to log in 
to check to make sure it 
worked." student Bobby 
Rue said. 

The new e-mail of- 
fers all of the benefits of 
Google's Gmail, includ- 
ing six gigabits of storage 
and easy to use searching 



of saved emails. 

While Google makes 
the majority of its rev- 
enue from advertise- 
ments, the university 
e-mail accounts will 
not feature any ads the 
way Gmail, Google's 
Tree email service, does. 
Google offers the use of 
e-mail and its other ap- 
plications free of cost to 
educational institutions, 
like IPFW. 

In addition to provid- 
ing a plethora of infor- 
mation and easy step- 
by-step guidance, IT 
Services does have help 
desk staff available to as- 
sist those who need ad- 
ditional assistance with 
(he email account con- 
version. 

The Help Desk can 
also help with other 
technology related sup- 



port. IT Services has 
even gone so far as to or- 
ganize Hands-On Migra- 
tion Sessions, as a walk 
through to the technol- 
ogy-phobic among us. 
If none of the Migration 
Sessions fit your sched- 
ule, an appointment can 
be made with IT Services 
at your convenience. 

"It |Gmail| is better 
than it |IPFWemail| was 
before; you can now see 
your sent messages," 
Amber Clark, student. 

After October 2. un- 
converted accounts 
will automatically be 
switched to the new 
email system. However, 
any saved emails in the 
old system will be lost, so 
it would be a good idea 
to switch as soon as you 
can to avoid frustrations 
later.

College students are not necessarily 

J known for their keen sense of fashion. 

I When most people try to conjure up 
the image of a typical college student, 

j they envision tousled, unruly hair, ratty 
sneakers and old sweatshirts. 

It is almost offensively stereotypical 
to say that most college students roll 
out of bed not caring how they appear 
to others. There are many students 
out there, and here at Johns Hopkins 

i University, that take time and effort to 
look put-together. 

Our parents, our college guidance 
counselors and those college 
brochures we all collected our senior 
year claim that college prepares you 
for the real world. In the real world, 
appearance does matter. Therefore, 
students should take some care in the 
way they dress for class. If professors 
dress appropriately for class, why 
shouldn't students? They should treat 
their classes as they would their jobs 
and dress accordingly. 

Clean jeans and a clean shirt are 
more than acceptable. But it's more 



than the clothes we wear. It's also 
about how we look. Students should 
brush their hair, shower and wear 
clean clothes. 

I think that those who complain 
about time constraints in the morning 
can easily take an extra five minutes 
to brush their hair and put on a clean 
T-shirt. It is not that difficult. 

I understand the pressures that 
come with being a student, particularly 
at a prestigious university such as this 
one. I understand that sometimes all 
you want to do is throw on a sweatshirt 
after a long night of studying. And this 
is perfectly acceptable once in a while. 
But it is completely inappropriate to 
do so everyday. What you wear in your 
free time is your own business. But if 
you are going to class, you should dress 
accordingly. Take some pride in your 
appearance. 

And if you won't do it for yourself, 
do it for the people in your class - ifs 
unbelievably distracting trying to 
hold your breath throughout an entire 
class period because you're trying not 
to smell the unshowered, unkempt 
heathen sitting next to you.

IPFW invites Brian Derek and Jaco 
perform at the Sweetwater Sound 



By Hana Hawash 

haruluwMh&amp;yahoo com 



The Jazz Ensemble 
of IPFW put on a strik- 
ing performance at 
Sweetwater Sound last 
Friday evening, Sep- 
tember 25th, featuring to get into the Midn 



five, which was the result 
of a mental disorder, laco, 
the only post-70s bassist 
known on a first name 
basis, was diagnosed 
with bi-polar disorder. 
He died from injuries 
sustained while trying 



famed Jazz r 
an Derek, who is a well 
known hass player in the 
community. One of the 
world's best known Bass 
players, Jaco Pastorius. 
was the theme of the eve- 
ning. 

According to Derek, 
a good friend of the Pas- 
torius family, Jaco died 
at the early age of thirty- 



Club in Fort Lauderdale. 
Florida, when the door- 
man beat him repeatedly. 
He went into a coma and 
after about nine days, his 
family decided to cut off 
life support since there 
seemed to be no hope. 
Even after the plug was 
pulled, he continued to 
live for hours. 

Though Jaco's music

is remarkable, the Jazz 
Ensemble did a brilliant 
job performing his music 
live for the first time. At 
one point, there was a bit 
of tension on stage, but 
the director. Dr. Farrell 
Vernon, did a splendid 
job of getting the group 
back on track. Clay Ken- 
nerk sang for the song 
entitled Fannie Mae, 
which brought smiles to 
everyone's face in the au- 
dience. Andrew Upshaw,

did a great job, adding 
to the performance that 
could take a person from 
tears to laughter.

3-D Movies are Making a Comeback 



By Troy Woiverton 



Those who remember the cheesy 
horror flicks of the '50s might 
not believe it, but 3-D movies are 
experiencing a renaissance and may 
usher in an era where viewing images 
in three dimensions is the rule, not 
the exception, in the past five years, 
about 20 3-D films have hit theaters, 
most recently "The Final Destination" 
last weekend. Another 50 or so are in 
production, including "Avatar," the 
latest film from "Titanic" director lames 
Cameron. One reason for the surge is 
that theater owners have found they 
generally can charge more for three- 
dimensional films than their two- 
dimensional counterparts, analysts 
and industry experts say. 

Entertainment, electronics and 
technology companies hope to follow 
Hollywood's lead and bring 3-D display 
technologies into consumers' homes. 

The I950s3-Dhorrorfilmsproduced 
two different images by overlapping 
blue- and red-tinted images. Viewers 
were able to see a 3-D image by wearing 
goofy glasses with one red lens and one 
blue one that canceled out the tints on 
screen. Later techniques used in the 
1970s and 19B0s overlapped images 
projected in light that had been altered 
by polarization. Viewers had to wear 
glasses with lenses polarized in two 
different ways. A polarized lens or filter 
acts like the teeth of a comb: only light 
of the same polarization - i.e., whose 
waves are parallel to the comb's teeth - 
can. pass through. The latest iterations 
of 3-D still typically require you to 
wear glasses - sometimes polarized, 
sometimes with electronic "shutters- 
thai alternately close over each eye. But 
they rely on computer technologies, 
such as digital video projectors and 
computerized production, to get 
the 3-D effect. Those advances have 
corrected some of die bugs that plagued 
past iterations of 3- D video. With analog 
film projection, it was relatively easy 
for the two images to get out of sync, 



or for the image to flicker or degrade. 
Such problems could not only diminish 
the 3-D effect but leave viewers with 
nausea or headaches. Digital images 
don't degrade like film does and the 
computer behind the projector can 
keep the stereoscopic images in 

"Electronic companies are 

already making 3-D capable 

monitors..." 



perfect sync. "The technology is now 
bulletproof," said Michael Lewis, CEO 
and co-founder of RealD. whose 3-D 
projector technology has been the 
most widely adopted in the United 
States. "It truly replicates the way we 
see.'' The bulk of 3-D films using the 
latest digital techniques have been 
animated films. That's because such 
films are composed on computers and 
already constructed in three virtual 
dimensions. Translating them into 
stereoscopic 3-D images is a fairly 
easy task. In contrast, live-action films 
require different camera equipment. 
And directors have to be brought up 
to speed on how to film and use 3-D, 
analysts say. That's slowly happening, 
but it may be a long time before 3-D 
makes its way into the living room. 

To project stereoscopic 3-D images, 
a TV or monitor needs to have a refresh 
rate of at least 120 Hz. notes Jon Peddie 
president of Jon Peddie Research. 
While new televisions typically can do 
that, few older ones can. he said. So 
most consumers will need to buy 
a new TV or computer monitor to 
watch 3-D programming, and many 
may be reluctant to go through the 
upgrade cycle in the near future after 
recently replacing their old analog 
TVs with digital ones. ■That'll be a 
barrier," Peddie acknowledges. He 
and other analysts think the first place 
3-D will take off in the home is with 
video games. As with animated films, 
games are already produced in three 



virtual dimensions, making them fairly 
easy to display in stereoscopic 3-D. 
Electronics companies are already 
making special 3-D-capable monitors, 
game companies are starting to make 
3-D-compatible games and graphics 



chip giant Nvidia is pushing software 
that can display standard games in 
3-D. Gamers present a natural target, 
Brennesholtz said. "There are lots of 
gamers willing to spend a lot of money " 
on games and accessories, he said.

The 1PFW Department of Theatre 
takes great pleasure in presenting their 
first musical of the year entitled Urinet- 
own, starting this Friday at 8pm inside 
Williams Theatre on the IPFW campus. 

As surprising as the title may be, 
Urinetown is an award -winning, laugh- 
out-loud musical about a futuristic 
city that experiences a drought, which 
causes a water shortage so bad, that pri- 
vate restrooms are banned and citizens 
are forced to use public facilities at a 
cost. These cosdy toilets are controlled 



by an evil company that sends anyone 
that does not pay to a mysterious far- 
away land known as Urinetown, where 
these people are never to be seen again. 
Eventually a rebellion is in order, led by 
Bobby Strong (played by Ethan Bair), to 
stop the nonsense and bring free access 
to toilets for the citizens. 

Urinetown will be showing on Oc- 
tober 2, 3, 8, 9, and 10 at 8pm as well 
as a Sign Language Interpreted Perfor- 
mance on October 11 ai 2pm. Tickets 
are $16 for adults, S14 Tor seniors/fac- 
ulty /staff/ alumni and $5 for students 
18 and under. Group tickets are avail- 
able for $12 with 10 or more people and 
also for non-lPFW college students. As 
always, IPFW students get in free.

Roommate's Pick: Brand New 



By Mark Cox 

( unaOIttl tu dcnls.1 pfwfd 



Late last year in 2Q0B, 
it was rumored that Brand 
New was working on their 
fourth LP Album, which 
-was supposed to come out 
summer of 2009 and later 
delayed to October 2009. 
Originally the album was 
named And One Head Can 
Never Die, although was 
abruptly changed a few 
days later to Daisy, and 
instead of October, was 
going to be released Sep- 
tember 22, 2009. 

The album starts off 
with "Vice" which is a 
nice older-style melody 
being played from a re- 
cord, which reminded me 
of music from the video 
game Fallout. Midway 
into the song, the song 
changes from this calm 
and innocent tone to 
screams and squelching 
guitar chords. The great 
thing that 1 love about 
Brand New is that they 
can go from loud, scream- 
ing compositions to really 
mellow and meaningful 
sounds. A slow song, "Bed" 
strikes me as a really great 
song that is catchy and 
also shows a little insight 
of where the band will go 
in future songs with their 



*/&gt;&lt;/&gt; 




experimentation of these 
tracks. 

I feel like this album 
is one of their most inde- 
pendent in rJieir sound. 
There's a more bold sound 
to it and seems a little less 
sloppy, however I am not 
sure that any of the songs 
will be as big of hits as 
from past albums Deja en- 
endu ("The Quiet Things 
That No One Ever Knows" 
and "Sic Transit Gloria... 
Glory Fades") and 77ie 
Devil and God Are Raging 
Inside Me ("Sowing Sea- 
son"), although it has a lot 
of potential for apprecia- 
tion by their fanbase.

A track I don't like from 
Daisy is "Be Gone"--to 
me it sounds like Willie 
Nelson mixed with a little 
bit of the devil doing lyr- 
ics instead of Jesse Lacey. 
"Daisy" which names the 
album is a quiet song that 
I'm not so sure how I feel 
about. It's got a great tune 
to it and is underlined by 
a child's conversation. As 
the song goes on it gets 
louder and louder as well 
as the tempo increas- 
ing until there's an anti- 
climactic ending to the 
song. Overall, the album is 
a good one and deserves a 
good listening to.

album continues, and the 
vocal styling is that of 'sing

Billy Talent: 
Caught in the 
Undertow 



Artist: Billy Talent 

Album: /// 

Label: Roadrunner 

Release Date: 

September 22, 2009 

Sounds Like: A band 
thai used to be great, but 
has lost touch with the 
aspects that made them 
such. 

Rating: 2.5/5 




There are fragments of 
the old Billy Talent that shine 
lluough from time to time, 
however those parts are 
simply fragments and fail to 
deviate from the prescribed 
formula this album has from 
track one. 

What was memorable 



about Billy Talent was the fact 
that they were fast, violent 
rock music that was both 
piercing and pleasurable to 
the ear at the same time all 
the while focusing on the 
intricacies of each instrument. 
"Devil On MY Shoulder" and 
"Rusted From the Rain," the 
first two tracks on the album, 
are obviously different songs 
but both of them follow 
this formula that is almost 
identical. It is almost as if the 
two songs minor each other. 

The third track "Saint 
Veronika" begins with a 
catchy bass introduction with 
ascratchyguitarbuildupwith 
those classic piercing vocals 
beginning to shine through, 
lust when the listener thinks 
that the old Billy is back, 
it reverts right back to the 
shortcomings of the first rwo 
tracks. The rest of the album 
follows suit. 

It is disappointing to see 
a band that held such great 
promise fall into the trap of 
modem radio. Some bands 
hold strong, and some fall 
under the wave. It feels as if 
Billy Talent was very much 
caught in the undertow.

"Bed," is ridden with the 
smoother sounds that fans 
are used to; brooding vocals. 
desperation, a whisper with 
more intensity reaching into 
the depths of the listener's 
soul and shattering the 
window that guards it. 

Continuing with "At The 
Bottom." it seems as though 
Brand New is announcing 
to the world their plans, and 
at this moment, the album 
becomes unstoppable. 

"Well I carry this box to its 

E roper place/ And when I 
fwer it down/ 1 let you fade 
away," the lyrics break the 
listener down into a pile of 
frustration, uneasiness, and 
at times anger. lust when 
listening to these words 
becomes easier, the next 
track "Gasoline" comes 
back with its vocal intensity 
and attempts to reinvent 
uneasiness: they succeed 



again. 

There are slower songs, 
some more melodic than 
nthers, but a listener can 
put this album in when they 
are feeling perfectly serene 
and comfortable in their 
surroundings and by the 
time the album Is done, it 
makes a basket case of the 
audience. 

Hints throughout the 
album indicate that Brand 
New may be finished, or they 
just need a break. A long 
break, or an opportunity to 
expand independently with 
solo careers. Nobody really 
knows what is in the future 
for (hern. 

Unlike previous releases, 
guitarist and backing 
vocalist Vlnnie Accardi wrote 
the majority of this album 
as opposed to lead singer 
and guitarist Jesse Lacey 
which may lend cause to the 
complete and utter change 
in tone that Daisy merits. 
Either way, this album is (in 
cliche* terms) an emotional 
rollercoaster that will leave 
the listener befuddled, lost, 
confused, angry, sad, and 
triumphant all at the same 
time.

Have you ever thought 
you would see a Rubik's cube, 
a mad scientist and a wannabe 
Bret Michaels in the Alumni 
Plaza? Well, people who 
participated in the Nearly Naked 
Mile on Wednesday, September 
23rd did. The event, which 
was organized by the Student 
Government, Student Activities 
Board, Athletics and the Alumni 
Association, consisted of a mile 
walk/ run from the Alumni Plaza, 
around the student housing and 
back. Walkers and runners of all 
shapes and sizes gathered at the 
Alumni Plaza at 7 p.m. to strip 
some clothes off and donate 
some of their gently worn ones to 
the Fort Wayne Rescue Mission. 

Of course, there were 
some guidelines to what was 
allowed to be worn. According 
to Kimberly Wagner, Director of 
Alumni Relations, participants 
could wear as little as they 
were comfortable with, but had 



to wear "at least as much as a 
traditional bathing suit would 
cover." Nevertheless, there were a 
few people who blurred the lines 
of a bathing suit. For instance, 
one man "donned" nothing 
but a thong • the front of which 
was an elephant's head. In turn, 
others took a more conservative 
approach, with one dressing in 
a full body suit of IPFW colors, 
and others in good old fashioned 
t-shirts and shorts. 

Before everyone took 
off on their mile long trip, four 
winners were announced for 
costume competitions. The 
categories being: best celebrity 
look-a-like, best group, most 
creative and most school spirit. 

Although this is the first 
year for the Nearly Naked Mile, 
Wagner said, "We hope to make 
this an annual event but will 
make the final decision after 
we see how well participants 
enjoy the event this year!" One 
runner, Ben Patty, is hopeful for 
its return. "I had a great time," 
Patty said, "I would really like to 



do this again sometime." hosted an after-party for the 

Upon everyone's return. Nearly Naked runners. Whether 

they were greeted with Nearly HOT 107.9 was everyone's radio 

Naked Mile t-shirts and much station of choice or not, you 

needed bottles of water. Also, would never be able to tell - 

to end the night off, HOT 107.9 everyone had a great time.

How to Get the Most Out of 

Your Education 

or 
What to Do When You Hit a Brick Wall 



By Louisa Danielson 

danlla01Oitudenb.lplw.Hlu 



You've tried every- 
thing listed on the hand- 
out for finding thecorrect 
answer, bul it just isn't 
working. You feel like a 
right brain in a left-brain 
world - totally frustrated! 
But wait - miracles do 
happen. Here are a few 
tips for breaking through 
that impossible' barrier. 

First of all, take a 
break. Close the laptop 
lid, put down the pencil, 
stretch, Get a drinkof wa- 
ter. Totally distract your- 
self from the problem at 
hand for a few minutes - 
do the dishes or practice 
piano or complete some- 
thing else that has to be 
done before you shut 
down for the night. 

Okay, now pick up the 
instructions again. Look 
them over carefully. Try 
to label the various parts 
of the equation, or iden- 
tify the different pans 
of the musical phrase. 
Labeling really helps 
you to visualize what it 
is that's going on within 



the equation or piece of 
music. 

If it just isn't working, 
talk with the professor. 
Check out his or her of- 
fice hours, and bring the 
work you've done. Most 
professors are very will- 
ing to help students ap- 
proach a subject from a 
new perspective. And, 
bringing along the work 
you have already done 
helps them to identify 
where you are having 
trouble. 

In the event that the 
professor doesn't have 
office hours or is unable 
to meet with you, check 
out the tutoring center. 
The Center for Academic 
Support and Advance- 
ment (CASA) is located 
in the basement of Ket- 
tler. room*G23. Tutoring 
sessions are free, but you 
are limited to two hours 
per subject per week. 
This means that you 
could have two hours of 
chemistry, two hours of 
Spanish and two hours 
of music tutoring all in 
one week - just not three 
hours of Spanish. Tutor- 
ing is a great way to hare 



dialogue about a partic- 
ular subject - some stu- 
dents who take tutoring 
early on in their academ- 
ic careers become tutors 
for those same subjects 
later on. 

Finally, know that ev- 
eryone hits a brick wall 
at some time. You're not 
alone. Just remember 
that you're in charge of 
initiating the learning 
process - it's up to you to 
look for help. Keep ask- 
ing until you get it. Every- 
one has their own style of 
understanding subjects, 
and each person has his 
or her own area of ex- 
pertise. If there's some- 
thing that you feel could 
be explained more fully, 
explore Google or go to 
the library and check out 
different sources. Dis- 
cuss your thoughts with 
the professor. Investi- 
gate ideas. This is your 
chance to make the most 
of the tuition you have to 
pay - make it worth your 
money. 

lust don't depend on 
Wildpedia for all your 
facts.

Stay healthy and go hungry: 

Documentary Food Inc. shows dark side 



By Kelly McLendon 

mdcndon bel lyttgmal I torn 

There is a new movie 
in town playing at The 
Cinema Center Food 
Inc. Il is about the cor- 
ruption of the food pro- 
duction industry and is a 
must-see for anyone who 
believes conspiracy and 
processed Food go hand 
in hand. 

The him starts out 
with Eric Schlosser, au- 
thor of Fast Food Nation, 
eating a hamburger from 
a diner. After Schlosser 
reported about "excre- 
ment in the meat" in his 
book, now audiences 
watch him actually eat a 
hamburger. This proves 
the point that while peo- 
ple know some, or most 
of the food they cat is 
toxic, they will keep con- 
suming it anyway. The 
old adage, "you get what 
you pay for," is certainly 
true with today's food 
industry. At the grocery 
store, a shopper will 



notice that the cheap- 
est food often has to the 
least nutritional value. 

"The very cheap- 
est foods are calorie- 
rich and nutrient-poor. 
Because they contain 
refined grains, sugars 
and fats, they also taste 
good and. of course, are 
easy to come by." Adam 
Drewnowski, a professor 
of epidemiology at the 
University of Washington 
in Seattle said in an MS- 
NBC report. 

Food Inc. features a 
family who frequents 
fast-food restaurants. 
They very rarely cook 
meals at home and 
when they do, they are 
unhealthy. The cameras 
followed this family to 
the grocery store for a 
shopping trip. The older 
sister told the younger 
that she shouldn't get 
any fruit because the 
price per pound of it was 
too expensive. Then they 
loaded the cart with soda 
pop. The mother said 



what she buys is heav- 
ily affected by budget- 
ary constraints. Instead 
of cooking at home, it 
is cheaper and easier 
to buy the whole family 
something off the Dol- 
lar Menu. The saddest 
pan of the story is that 
the younger sister, who 
TTIn elementary school, 
already has diabetes 
from the lifestyle she has 
grown up with. 

The film is not for 
those who are unwill- 
ing to hear that there are 
very unsavory farming 
and production practic- 
es going on. Set up as a 
documentary, Food Inc. 
provides an eye-opening 
look at how big business- 
es are taking away the 
rights of the people. And 
possibly making them 
very, very sick. 

Would it surprise any- 
one that in today's world, 
eating beef, lettuce or 
peanut butter might just 
kill a person? With the 
many outbreaks of E. coli 




Photo Curtesy of foodincmovlc.com 



that happen every few 
years, this isn't a shock- 
er. In 2006, people died 
from eating contami- 
nated spinach, according 
to MSBNC. In the film. 
a woman who is now a 
food advocate, shares her 



painful story. Her young 
son died after developing 
hemorrhagic E. coli after 
consuming beef. Now 
she talks to state repre- 
sentatives about what 
they can do to heighten 
the food safety laws. 



Overall, the film is 
informative and shock- 
ing. As the tagline says, 
"you'll never look at din- 
ner the same way again." 
and after watching Food 
Inc.. that is a big possibil- 
ity.

Finding your inner activist 
and saving the Maumee 



ByAlysenWade 



Activism, as the 
word implies, requires 
action. This means 
real-live people working 
together to accomplish 
a common goal. As 
young people, we are so 
inundated by the myriad 
of social, political and 
environmental problems 
that acquiescence often 
seems the only tolerable 
method of survival. This 
cycle of inactivity and 
pessimistic reasoning 
of "the world is far too 
big for me to have any 
affect." becomes the 
foundation for which 
we lead our lives. 
However, a giant leap 
in overcoming apathy 
is arming ourselves 
with knowledge and 
discovering tangible 
solutions to fix 

immediate concerns in 
our local community. 
One point of obvious 
concern is the crisis of 
the rivers. 

Pipe discharge, 
aging sewer systems, 
previously unregulated 



dumping; PCB's (man 
made chemicals), 

high mercury levels, 
pesticides. E. coli, and an 
infamous toxic landfill 
all contribute to our 
impaired waterways. 
IPFW alumna. Abigail 
Frost purchased 

riverfront real-estate 
in 2000 and has since 
been gathering alarming 
details regarding the 
problems facing our 
rivers. She has also 
succeeded in forming a 



and corporate entitles 
accountable; also by 
riverbank clean-up and 
continued education, 
clean rivers are not out of 
reach. 

Abigail also urges 
students to take part in 
revitalization activities 
by participating in 
clean-up of the St. loe 
River that runs directly 
through the campus. 
"All you have to do is 
go down there..." Frost 
says. Because 85% of 



of Save 
Maumee Organization 
and combine their 
energies to provide real 
and lasting solutions. 

As an inspiration 
to those of us unwilling 
to let life's challenges 
inattentively spiral past, 
Abigail Frost reminds 
us in the words of Ross 
Perot, that "The activist 
is not the (one] who says 
the river is dirty. The 
activist is the |one| who 
cleans up the river." 



"The activist is not the [one] who says 

the river is dirty. The activist is the [one] 

who deans up the river" 



grassroots organization 
aimed at educating as 
well as inciting the public 
to take part in watershed 
restoration. A private 
citizen who has devoted 
herself to the cause, she 
firmly states: "I do not 
want to let it go." 

After eight 

years of leading the 
community in action, she 
says there are ways to fix 
this problem. By keeping

Lady Dons Start Road 
Trip With Split Weekend 




By Logan Pea

The IPFW Women's 
volleyball team look a 
long road irip oui west 
[his past weekend in 
hope of bringing their 
7-6 record to a better 
number. The Lady Dons 
started their weekend in 
Tulsa, Oklahoma play- 
ing a big Summit Ath- 
letic Conference match 
against Oral Roberts 
University. The match 
was close, probably be- 
ing one of the tightest 
matches of the season 
for the Lady Dons, but 
they just couldn't seem 
to keep ORU down Sat- 
urday night. The vol- 
leydons battled through 
four sets, winning the 
second, and eventually 
fell 3-1. The loss put a 
slow start to the week- 
end for IPFW. but the 
new game presented a 
new opportunity for a 
good ride home if diey 
could knock out Cente- 
nary College. The Dons 
did everything they 
knew they needed to do 
to make that happy ride 
happen. The Lady Dons 
controlled the match 
from the start, winning 
the first set 25-21, and 
the second set 25-20 to 
set up another good ol' 
fashioned sweep! IPFW 
took care of Centenary 
College in the third set

25-16, and were able to 
head home happy, get- 
ting their Summit Ath- 
letic Conference record 
up to .500 (3-3). One 
Volleydon who was es- 
pecially happy with the 
sweep was AH Hook. 
Hook came up with elev- 



en blocks all by herself, 
tying an IPFW school 
record. The Dons are on 
the road undl they come 
home for two straight 
home matches at the 
Gates Center on Octo- 
ber 9 and October 10. 
Those two matches will 



be played first against 
Western Illinois, then 
against IUPUI. Both of 
those matches are Sum- 
mit Athletic Conference 
match-ups, so come out 
and support your Lady 
Dons onto some big con- 
ference victories! 



The opening tuurna- 
mrm hi" ihe spring sea- 
son ;it Bowling Green 

was a [limp off point for 
the Lady Dons. Now that 
they have played their 
first match of the spring 
season, what works for 
the team and what needs 
to be improved is more 
apparent. What was ap- 
parent was that playing 
six matches in three days 
is a tot for the ladies to 
deal with. 

"We were all pretty 
tired and sore," said ju- 
nior Amy Recht about 
the endurance of the 
team. 

Recht was one of two 
IPFW players to be run- 
ner-up in their singles 
divisions. She went 2-1 
in singles before losing 
to Angelina Joasuria in 
the night 2 champion- 
ship match. Sopho- 
more Alexandra Forsyth 
advanced to the flight 
8 championship where 
she was defeated by ]ade 
lohnson. Recht and dou- 
bles partner sophomore 
Katie Brien also placed 
second in flight 3. 

The Dons have 
three more spring sea- 
son matches. The 2010 
season officially starts 
January 23 with a home 



match versus Toledo. 

I ht I S ue already 

looking forward to the 
regular season. 

"We want to hold 
our title .is the summit 
League Champions and 
this year we would love 
to make it li&gt; the NCAAs," 
Bald the team's lone se- 
nior, Alexa Rang. She 
added that "this year. 
Oral Roberts better look 
nut," referring to the 
Summit League rival that 
defeated IPKW4-3 in the 
conference champion- 
ship last season. 

Even Ihis early in 
the spring, the morale of 
the team isvixv high. 

"As long as injuries 
stay away, I know we will 
be one of the top teams 
in our conference," states 
Rang. About the coming 
season Recht adds," we 
did such a good job last 
year when our team was 
very young so (he out- 
look for this year Is pictty 
bright." 

Other players on the 
team are slightly more 
forthright about how 
they feel die team will do 
ihfsaeason. 

"We're going to 
dominate |the Summit 
League | this season," 
claims Forsyth. 

After Christmas 
break, the Dons will have 
die opportunity to make 
good on Forsyth's claim. 



Dons Lose Two 



By Logan Pea

The IPFW Men's 
soccer team went into 
a big weekend with a 
chance of picking up 
two important wins, with 
one being a conference 
game. We'll start Friday 
night at Heffher Stadi- 
um, where IPFW found 
themselves tangled In 
a defensive battle with 
Centenary College. The 
defense for both squads 
would hold strong 
through the first half, 
and carry over into the 
second half where Cen- 
tenary College took the 
lead one a Tate Mclntyre 
rebound from eight feet 
away to give them a 1-0 



advantage. The Dons 
outshotCC 23-13 for die 
game, showing that they 
had their chances, and 
just couldn't get a shot 
passed the CC goalten- 
der. The loss put IPFW in 
a position to rebound in 
a big way Sunday. IPFW 
traveled to Chesterton. 
Illinois to try to end the 
weekend on a high note 
by defeating thepanthers 
from Eastern Illinois 
University on their own 
field. In the first half, just 
seven minutes into the 
game, everything looked 
to go as planned when 
MaxTouloute netted one 
into the bottom right 
comer, getting his fourth 
goal of the season and 
more importantly giving 
IPFW a big 1-0 earfy ad- 
vantage. Sadly, the next 



71 minutes of the game 
seemed to belongto EIU. 
The panthers scored four 
straight goals, and put the 
Dons in a tough position 
with little time remain- 
ing. In the TB^minutes, 
Casey Bowman drew a 
penalty on an EIU player, 
and was awarded a pen- 
alty kick. Bowman put 
the penalty kick into the 
back of the net, and cut 
the lead two. Time just 
seemed to slip away too 
fast, and the Dons could 
not recover. The game 
ended at that score (4-2) 
and IPFW headed back 
toFortWayne.. IPFWhas 
a few days off, then take 
a long trip out to Tulsa.

For the IPFW Wom-

year has seemed to be 
so dose to a big turn 
around. That day may 
have been Sunday. Five

IPFW have been by one

one more game, which 
was the game played 
Sunday afternoon in

When time ran out, and 
the teams shook hands, 
the scoreboard read 2-1 
in favor of the visiting 
Mastadons. The win 
pushed IPFW right into 
the scoring column giv-

the game opened up 22
