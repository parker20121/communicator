Letter to the Edi 



Dear Editors and Thomas L. 
Bryant; 

MF. promoting Harx, Lenin, 
and Hitler? Oh wou! I had 
to liiugh all the way home. 
Home Is a large ranbllng 
house full of anti-Marxist 
private property and indivi- 
dualistic, antl-authoriCar- 
Inn people of different age 
groups. We could not possibly 
live together if we didn't 
consider each others indivi- 
dual freedoms and also the 
rights o£ the group. 

My sentence, "However, we 
think It would be even more 
senseless and destructive to 
let our country be led Into 
anarchy which is what we 
would have if all of us put 
our individual freedoms a- 
bove those of the CQmmunity" 
is an honesc statement o£ 
fact. 

Individual freedom Is a 
desirable goal, but It must 
be set within the context of 
a community. The word 'com- 



munity' could refer to as 
few as two people living to- 
gether or it could encompass 
the whole wide world. In 
either case the community Is 
a fact of life which can not 
be denied. The trick is to 
find our freedoms within the 
community. 

And we do^ have freedoms. 
We are free to read anything 
we like from Marx, to Play- 
boy, to the Holy Bible. If 
we choose the Bible we can 
read the Douay version, the 
King James version, or a mod- 
ern interpretation. As adults 
we are free to gain or refuse 
an education. Me are free 
to live in our home commun- 
ity or move away. 

We are free to work for a 
small company, a large one, 
go Into" business for our- 
selves, not work, or train 
for a professional job. We 
are free to impose our words 
on the Communicator readers, 
or we may refrain from the 



Temptation. We are limited 
only by our individual abili- 
ties and desires. 

We are free to live a 
completely indi vidua I I ife 
(like a hermit) or we are 
free to Inter-act with the 
community and take on family 
responsibilities to a great- 
er or lesser degree. We 
are also free to be complete- 
ly npathetic where government 

involved as we wish. 

Thanks to the actively in- 
volved the eighteen year olds 
who were eligible to be draft- 
ed ace now free to vote. 

Some pessimistic Conmuni- 
cator readers may not see 
these freedoms { or do they 
just like to gripe?) but 
they are there none the leas. 
With all theae concerned 
eighteen year old's voting 
we wilt keep our freedoms, 

--H.J. Leffers

ter of town. Thp only pro- 
blem that stood in the way 
was transportation, and Find-

This tub was euickly rlean-

An T-P student, Paul 
Jacouay, heard of our plight 
and offe-ed us a bathtub from 
his family's garage. Once a- 
gain we "ent out and picked 
it up. Thp second tub was 
bigger than the first and in- 
cluded brass fixtures and U

"hat "e were looking for. 
The tub was then cleaned and 
painted with the words "I-P

During the neyt week, both 
tubs sat In Indiana-Purdue's

Pushing the tub for WOWO Penny Pitch 



On the ■'ith both teams, one 
pufihlPR from the campus on 
the North and one pushlnp, 
from the South, converged on 
do'-ntOL-n Fo'-t 'Oayne vi Ch much 
fanfare. Last years District 
Govrrno'-, Kenny Scott, used 
a bullhorn to shout out thr 
purpose of Che Cub to encour- 
age contributions. The 
North team, l^d by Jane 
Nicodemus, project chairman, 
had a trump"ter (n the fo'm 
oE Jim Castor with a 1890 
horn. AnothT co-i-d, Cheryl 
Napier, scood in Che middle 
of busy streets holding a 
sign and actually got cars 
to stop and donate. '•Jhen 
both teams finally reached 
the downto-jn area we both 
ooscrd oui-s^lves ftt the main 
Intersertions of town. When- 
ever th-- lights changed to 
rfd, on m-^mber with a Penny 
Pitch sign "ould jump in 
Front of a line of cars with 
big grins and th-lr stocking 
cape open to collect any do- 
nations that "ere handed them. 
Drnise Hoffman was '-specially 
adept at doing this. When 
th" light turned green, thi- 
team nulckly cleared the 
Street and repeated the pro- 
cedure on the stopped cars 
at the other light. 

Finally we pushed che tubs 
to the WOWO lobby in doimtown 
Fort Wayne and proceeded to 
count every dollar, quarter, 
and penny. After 7 hours and 
15 minutes o£ counting, the 
total was a record-breaking 
$1348.44. We were then taken 
on a Cour of the facilities 
and Jane Nicodemus and Jim 
Roehm were allowed Co go on 
Che air with DJ Stu Collins. 
He asked us various quest- 
ions about Che push and 
about Circle K in general. 
After this, the members left 
for home, exhausted.

Christian morality on war to be portrayed 



Christian morality lead 
nine Catholics to civil dis- 
obedience at Catonsvllle, 
Maryland. Their trial, pop- 
ularly known as the trial of 
the Catoi?svllle Nine, is the 
subject of a play written by 
one of the Nine, Father 
Daniel Berrigan. 

This play, which reenacts 
the trial, will be presented 
at the First Presbyterian 
Theatre on J.in. 28, 29, and 
Feb. ^,5, 11 , and 12. Dr. 
Daniel C.ishman is directing. 

The production, taken 
from actual courtroom trans- 
cripts of the trial, presents 
with full force the con- 
temporary dilemma of living 
according to Christian ideals 
In a nation which forces 



war upon Southeast Asia and 
uses conscripted men to 
fight that war. 

The play is also quite 
timely. Jeff Gibson, who 
portrays Daniel Berrigan 
in the production is pres- 
ently awaiting sentencing 
for failing to report for 
action. The motives of the 
Catonsvllle Nine in their 
ace of civil disobedience 
parallel those of Jeff In 



his action. Citizens who 
ulsh to comprehend why a 
growing number of Chris- 
tians (lay and clergy) 
and young people are going 
to prison for political 
crimes should attend this 
production. 

The production opens 
Jan. 28. Curtain time for 
all performances Is 8 p.m. 
General admission Is S2, 
SI for students.

"And If all the combined 
forces of Hell should a&amp;sembli 
In conclave, i^nd with them 
all the men on earth that

sir, the combined hellish In-

Always taking everything 
in my columns at face value 
would be tantamount to tak- 
ing Vance Hartke's etateoient 
that he Is a serious presi- 
dential contender at face 
value or believing that Mar- 
cuse has anything of value 
to say about urban politics. 

Hy criticisms of PIT 
theatre have aroused some 
animosity. PIT, which has 
during my four years here 
performed such gems as the 
anti-American Viet Rock (ad- 
vertised in ihr- C: ]• t &amp;i ion

'"' &lt;^ ' ' 1 I Ing with hlood) 
and tht iesbian .%ilUn5 jf 
Sister GeoTRe", outdid them- 
selves with "Celebration." 
As Billy Sunday said, "I am 
against everything the devil 
Is in favor of, and I favor 
everything the devil is 
agsLnsc, no matter what It 
is. If you know which side 
the devl 1 is on, put me dawn 
on the other side any time." 

Some PIT people have 
claimed I unfairly attacked 
certain "good" friends of 
theirs. My columns have con- 
tained numerous veiled barbs, 
but had I desired to attack 
specific individuals, I 
would have named them so as 
not CO deprive them of the 
distinction of being added 
to the Hippie Honor Roll, 



consisting of tho;

acked 



Actually, I shall take my 
stand with St. Augustine, and 
the Bible, that licentious 
acts, lewdness, and obsceni- 
ties are simply wrong. "The 
uncovering of part of a vo- 
man's breast" and the blas- 
phemy of our Lord aren'c Justi- 
fied by the. purported good 
ending of "Celebration." 

To return to Billy Sunday: 
'I don't believe vou can re- 
member when you heard a ser- 
mon on Hell. Well, you'll 
hear about Hell while I am 
here. God Almighty put Hell 
in the Bible and any preach- 
er that sidesteps it because 
there are people sitting In 
the pews who don't like it, 
ought CO get out of the pul- 
pit. He is simply trimming 
his sails to catch a passing 
breeze of popularity. " 

Though not a preacher, at 
least yet, I nevertheless will 
continue to cake my stand for 
the truth, even if I continue 
getting flak from the chespl- 
ans in PIT. That's life. Or 
Co puc it in more funky lan- 
guage, I, like Orphan, shall 
continue searching for my gar- 
den, though the Lord never 
promised me a rosegarden. 

Lastly, there was my al- 
iened attack on Mark Franke 
and his Lambda brothers 
through my "Twelfth Nlghc: 
-innlogy. Drinking has ad- 
mittedly Floored a lot of 
Lambdas' and I admit Chat 
most Lambdas are yes-men , 
but only because of such ex- 
pressions as "Have another? ' 
But my reference was a fri- 
endly comparison of cho gusto 
of their drinking to that of 
Sir Toby Belch, I've grown 
to like the Lambda gang-- 
Franke, Mueller, Dawson, 
GlUle, the good Logan, Knight 
and the rest. 

As W.C. Fields once said, 
"Thank goodness, if nothiBi?. 

drink." Uhich is precisely 
my feeling. 

SUB Chairman 



Letter-writer Mike Ellis 
felt that I was wrong In say- 
ing "any play which Intends 
to portray inmorality in 
society is indeed. Immoral It' 
self." This I didn't say, 
but- I'll gladly adopt the 
eloquent rhetoric of Michael. 

Mike also added that I 
wrongly condemned "the uncov- 
ering of part of a woman's 
breast or Che use of language 
not heard In church as Immor- 
al." I didn't say this 
either, and it's a bit of a 
broadbrush, but I like che 
ring of it.

104-6'i count. Cutting double 
figures for the Tuskers were 
John Powell and Ty Bishop, 
who tallied 17 and \2 points 
respectively. 

On Jan. 7th Ohio-State

I les respectively. 

Indiana -Purdue got back on

The Tuskers held an eleven-

Tuskers, Leading the attack 
for Indiana-Purdue was Tom 
Cowden with a final tally of 
26 points. This was Cowden's 
last game (and best) because 
he'll b^ working and won't 
be going to the regional 
this semester. 

Couden had strong support 
from Trump and Bishop who 
both canned 19. At this 
point Indiana-Purdue had a 
season log of 7-8. 

Then Honday the Tuskers 
faced the Foresters of Hunt- 
ington. Although without the 
potent one-two scorers Bailey 
and Eugene Devbrow, the reg- 
ional squad played well. Yet 
they were no match for the 
strong Foresters who took the 
contest 125-91. Ty Bishop 
poured in a season-high 15 
points to lead the Tuskers. 
He was backed by four other 
teammates who cracked double 
figures: Don Stroud (17), 
John Powell (14), Gary Trump 
(11), and Mark Putt (10). 

International Is next on 
the schedule. It will be 
a home game (■'t-the Central 
Rvm) Tuesday at 8:00. 

The regional JV's hold a 
i-2 mark this season. January 
4th they accomplished whatth 
the varsity could not do: 
they beat Indiana Tech, 60- 
52, Leading the attack were 
Tom Cowden with 12 and Rennie 
Worman with U. 

On January 15 the JV Tusk- 
ers whipped St, Francis for 
the sec -nd time, 78-68. P.ic- 
ing the winners were Roger 
Spice, Keith Woebbking, 
Horman, and Rex Putt with [al- 
lies of 19, \t., 14, and 10 



spectively. 
The JV's fared no better 
than the varsity against 
Huntington as they were 
trounced 96-65. Gary Betts 
led the Tuskers with 18 and 
was backed up by Spice and 
Putt who each netted 13. 

The next scheduled JV tilt 
will be against St. Frances 
next Tusday at 6:00 in the

sity game with International,
