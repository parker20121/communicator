JFK assassination 

Lecturer asserts conspiracy 

November 25, 1963 - one tJay after 
Oswald's murder. 

Harris himself did a run from the 
theater lo where ofTicer Tippci was 
shot; the same r^n thai Oswald was 
said 10 have done after the JFK as- 
sassination. This shooting was what 
supposedly lead pohce to Oswald. 

In addition to the lecture, Harris 
supplied the audience with a 50 
page publication, "Who Shot JFK?: 
An Altemaiive of Post War Ameri- 
ca." This publication included a 
seven page index complete wilh ref- 
erences and sources on the JFK as- 
sassination, the CIA and oiher 
coven opcraiions. Nazis in the US, 
corruption of the political system. 
groups guiding people to socially- 
conscious spending, bookstores 
dealing in hidden history, maga- 
zines to study and organizations to 
support. 

Even with his lectures concerning 
covert operations and their effect on 
civil liberties. Bob Harris still per- 
forms regularly on ^e comedy 
circuit 

One question Harris feels people 
are probably wondering is: Why 
shoiild we care what happenaj? 

He responds, "If we don't really 
know what's going on, then how are 
we going to make informed deci- 
sions? (Thcnl it's not a democracy."

"We're a nadonal fraiemity and we're 
trying to reach people outside of the 
IPFW community by conducting fun 
social events and raise money for chari- 
table causes," said Maryann Moore, an 
IPFW junior and chmr of the Easier egg

Cbief Reporter 

Who Shot JFK? The lecture was 
presented on March 23 by comedi- 
an, lecturer, researcher and activist 
Bob Harris. The Cleveland native 
staned writing a stage show to 
mimic conspiracies, the way the 
media covers them and how the 
public responds to them. The 25th 
anniversary of JFK's assassination 
prompted him to do research on 
JFK. In thai research, Harris found 
diat things didn't add up and the of- 
ficial story was indeed false. He 
pursued the case further and even 
moved to Washington, D.C, to do 
first hand research with the evi- 
dence on 5le. 

Who killed JFK? And how? 

Harris answered. "The govern- 
ment still contends that JFK was - 
conveniently - killed by a lunatic 
acting alone, firing 3 shots in 5.6 
seconds, (from] up on the 6th floor 
of the Texas School Bookstore 
Depository." 

The supposed evidence used 
against Lee Harvey Oswald has al- 
ways bci;n in question. 

"Basically when you look at the 
case in detail," Harris commented, 
"what we're finding is an awful 
marksman wilh no motive who 



made impossible shots, using an ob- 
solete rifle, defective ammunition 
valistically different from ihc frag- 
ments removed from victims, some- 
how left no fingerprints in the 
process and then escaped by taking 
a city bus." 

"Oswald," Harris examined, "is 
probably the only assassin in Amer- 
ican history lo use public trans- 
portation as a getaway car." 

Harris brought to light much in- 
formation concerning the assassina- 
tion of JFK and continuously told 
his audience that die information he 
obtained is available for public 
view in the archives in Washington. 

Some of the information he pre- 
sented that did not match the oITi- 
cial story were ihai the people on 
the scene who say they saw the gun, 
said that it was a mouscr. That is 
not the gun on display in the 
archives. 

The incredible shots that Oswald 
supposedly made have yet to be re- 
peated by any marksman. 

The handwriting on the various 
documents, presumably signed by 
Oswald, analysis say were done by 
several people. 

There were palm prints, not finger 
prints, on the alleged murder 
weapon and ihe fingerprint identifi- 
cation card of Oswald was dated 



Beering arrives; students protest 
on Monday afternoon at IPFW 



By Felicia Beechlng 
Editor In chief 

Steven Beering. Purdue University 
president, was the cause of a student 
and faculty protest at noon Monday 
in Kettler Hall. Approximately 20 
studcnu and faculty showed up to 
show support for lU professors on 
this campus, to object to the pro- 
posed changes to the Fiscal Manage- 
ment Agreement in July and increas- 
es of student fees, 

Beering held two meetings at 
IPFW. At 10 a.m.. he met wilh ad- 
ministrators and at 11 ajn. widi fac- 
ulty representatives William Freder- 
ick, Art Finco, Michael Downs. 
Frederick Kirchoff, and Steve Hol- 
lander. Frederick, presiding officer 
of Ihe faculty senate invited The 
Communicator's editor in chief to 
attend the meeting. 

"The press has a right to attend the 
meeting. Students have a right to 
know what's going on," said Downs. 

A few days before. Dottic Basseti, 
assistant to the chancellor, had cun- 
ly refused the editor's phone request 
to attend the meeiing. 

Escorted by Finco. Downs, and 
Frederick, she attempted to join the 
meeting. Chancellor Lant; told her 
to leave. 

A reporter from the Journal 
Gazette also attempted to get into 



the meeting, but the secretaries at 
the infomtation desk said that they 
didn't know there was a meeting. 

After die meeting, Frederick spoke 
about the agenda. 

"Beering said diat he is going to 
do what he wants, no matter what. 
T\vo key points: he wants to make 
the new Management Agreement 
unrerewablc and to make all IPFW 
faculty Purdue employees." said 
Flcderick. 

Currently the Management Agree- 
ment between IPFW, Purdue, and 
Indiana University is renewed and 
adjusted every five years. Becring's 
proposal would make the agreement 
permanent and unchangeable. 

Beering also proposes to not only 
make the fU professors Purdue em- 
ployees, but also to make Purdue re- 
sponsible for their tenure and pro- 
motion, according to Frederick. 

"Beering said that the new Man- 
Bgemcni Agreement will mirror the 
system used at lUPUI, but that's not 
irue!" said Hollander. "Promotion is 
dclcnnined at the university where 
one holds academic rank. I am not 
sure whether Beering is confused or 
lying." 

'The text varies radically from the 
way he [Beering] described il in the 
meeiing," said Downs, This is and 
continues lo be one of the most dif- 
ficult communication problems that 



we have wiOi West Lafayette." 

Beering was greeted after ihe 
meeting by unhappy studcnis and 
professors carrying signs. One said 
"Keep the Tin IPFW." 

Eric Ledbetier, a studcni from 
peace and conflict studies, helped 
organize the cvcni. 

"We wanted to have a peaceful 
protest and make our presence 
known. 1 am really happy that the 
protest remained that way." said 
Ledbetier, 

Area media turned out for the 
protest including TV, radio, and 
newspapers. 

Other students were there to 
protest Bcering's sexual orientation 
stance. One protester said that he 
ihirtks that Beering is being conde- 
scending to gays and lesbians. 

Beering and the Purdue Board of 
Trustees rejected IPnV's resolution 
passed by both student and faculty 
senates to protect sexual orieniation 
lasi year. Now. Beering has changed 
his mind and has allowed the Purdue 
campus to protect sexual oncniation. 

"This protest is not over, yci," said 
Ledbetier. "We need fiscal aatonomy 
from Purdue University. We want lo 
know why we gel $6.6 million dol- 
lars less than other comparable 
schools. Wc want to know why 
IPFW students are getting shafted."

Letters to the editor 



Smoke hurts everyone 



To the Editor: 

Regarding ihe student body presi- 
dent's recent commeni, ",,,1 don'l 
want 10 force my opinions on some- 
one else," in relation lo baiming 
smoking from every inside area of 
campus buildings: 

Smoking's effect on oihcrs isn't a 
matter of opinion. Whether homoseit- 
ualiiy is right or wrong is an opinion 
thai bears no effect on oih- 
crs; i^c., it_doe£n'i hun a 
person's health (for 
the sake of this cji- 
ample) to be in Uic 
same room as a 
gay person, nor 
should a person 
be physically ir- 
ritated to be in die 
same room as a 
gay person. 

The same can't be 
said of cigarette smoke. 
Cigarette smoke is hazardous 
to persons in the same atmosphere, 
which some choose to argue despite 
evidence, and smoking is at least an 
irritant and/or allergen to many peo- 
ple. The conclusion should be thai 
prohibiting smoking in areas common 
10 non-smokers and smokers is not 
forcing an opinion on people, as Suri 




claims, (3/18/93, in The Communica- 
tor) Is smoking ha/.ardous lo people? 
Ves. Is smoking irritating to people? 
Yes. How can this be consuucd as an 
opinion? 

I have to liken smokers being al- 
lowed to smoke anywhere ouisidc 
ilieir home where non-smokers are 
likely lo be 10 allowing people to 
drive drunk because they want to 
use Ihe road just like sober 
people wani to. Aten'l 
drunk drivers daoger- 



becai 



of 



their possible ef- 
fect on die lives 
of others? 

As for Suri's 
opinion ihai stu- 
dents should have 
he final say 
whether die smoking 
policy should be 
changed: Why not use the 
powers of inielleci raihcr than of a 
cuireni sentiment lo make this deci- 
sion? How many students who now 
wony aboui their smoking privileges 
will wish in ten years ihat they never 
slaned lo smoke?

Price for rite of passage is cold, hard cash 



I was thinking about money the oth- 
er day. I was writing out my monthly 
checks, something I do weekly il 
seems, and questions kepi popping in' 
lo my head. Things like, why is mon- 
ey so important? Aren't the best 
things in life free? Why are wc so ob- 
sessed wilh collecting small pieces of 
paper wilh deceased political heroes' 
portraits stamped on them? And w/u&gt; 
is responsible for the parasitic auto in- 
surance leeches who would suck the 
Lnsides out of a puppy if ihcy Ihought 
that puppy harbored cash? 

1 ihink thai money plays a much 
larger part in our society than just a 
common legal tender. According to 
our unvvriitcn ideology, having money 
is a virtue, Wc seem to judge a person 
by what "kind of living" he or she can 
provide for himself or herself, "Kind 
of living" means, or course, how 
many of those special pieces of paper 
a person has to play with. 

Fortunately, our form of currency is 
becoming much more sophisiicaied, 
to the point where the average person 
doesn't even need any actual physical 
pieces of paper to buy something. In 
fact, certain places of business these 
days will simply scoff ai you and 
maybe give you a noogic if you ny to 
pay with cash. Yes, I'm talking about: 

Credit cards are a brilliant invention. 
They lei you lake home a bunch of 
neat siuff without having to give up 
any of your green pieces of paper. The 
pieces of paper arc then extracted 
from your person in small amounts 
over a long period of time. This cuts 
down the trauma of having to part 
with all of your pieces of paper at 
once, li's like pulling out your hair 
one strand al a lime, instead of lop- 
ping oS the scalp al once. Also, with 



credit cards, you can buy something money is also an indicator of adull- 
for which you don't presently have hood. I remember when I was a child 



enough pieces of paper to buy. bui 
with a clever installment plan you can 
postpone your payments for at leasl a 
few months, thereby giving you 
enough time to buy lots of other neat 
stuff on crediL 

Another neat thing about credit 
cards is ihai you gel lo continue mak- 
ing payments on an arti- 
cle of clothing long af- 
ter it has been mangled 
by the dog, And the joy 
of paying for a VCR 
goes on and on, despite 
the fact that ii ate a lape 
last week and now ii 
won't do anything but 
"fast forward." 

Getting your very own 
credit card is no prob- 
lem. All you have to do 
is stand in one place 
long enough and credit 
card applicaiions will 

materialize around you. 

They usually ask general questions for your parents. The modem Ameri-

Just A Theory 
by Tim Schreiber 



my dad would spend entire evenings 
trapped in his office, engaged in a rit- 
ual called "doing the bills." I never 
knew whal il was he was doing exact- 
ly, but I gathered ihai he was either 
finding ihc square root of negative 
one or figuring out a fool-proof equa- 
tion for instant world peace, consider- 
ing how much lime he 
spent doing it. Il seems 
my dad spent most of 
my childhood "doing 
Ihe bills." 

So when I sat down to 
"do my bills" last week, 
ii occurred to me that I 
am now a grown-up. 
Paying your bills is one 
of those things that in- 
dicates your an adult. 
similar lo seeing your 
name in the phone book 
or having the Jehovah's 
Witness try to convert 
lead of asking 




es.) You don'l even have to write c 
of those stupid "Why I Would Like To 
Have a Credit Card" essays. I always 
hated applications like ihaL 

Incidentally, have you ever really 
looked at the dollar sign? The "S" 
wilh Ihe iwo venicaj lines through it? 
Don't you think that symbol lotric sus- 
piciously like an "S" trapped in jail 
behind bars? Perhaps an "S" thai 
couldn't pay its bills? Do you think 
that maybe the dollar sign is a sub- 
conscious message from your credi- 
tors? h'sjusi a theory. 

Aside from being a sianis symbol. 



paper. 

Bui I am swaying from my original 
point, which is; Why does money 
have such a stronghold on our lives? I 
think I've Hgurcd ii out. Money is 
power. And the drive for power is a 
strong human instinct 

When someone gives you i dollar, 
they are saying, "Here, have a tiny bit 
of power." Suddenly new optioiu are 
open to you. You can now go into the 
Dollar Tree and take home any item 
in the place. Even ihe bag of stale 
Bazooka Bubble Gum wilh WTappcrs 
written in Spanish. Or you could save 



thai dollar and join il with odicr liny 
bits of power, until you have a smaU 
bit of power 

The more money you have, the more 
control you have over your life. Let's 
say your car breaks down. If you have 
enough pieces of power, you can gel 
il fixed. If you don'l, you are up a cer- 
tain creek wiihoui a key piece of 
equipment, if you get my drift. So 
each of your pieces of power repre- 
sents a tiny bit of control over your 
own life. 

Now thai I've identified ihe sweet 
creamy tilling in the Twinkie of eco- 
nomics, the filling Ihat inspires people 
to buy lottery tickets, lei's not forget 
how addictive that filling can be. 
Power can be one of the most addic- 
tive vices a person can have. And ii 
tends to escalate, wilh ils victims 
wanting more and more, until one day 
they own half of Soulh America and 
siill isn't enough. Meanwhile other 
people don't even have enough pieces 
of power 10 feed thenwelves, 

I still believe that the best things in 
life are free, or at least cheap enough 
for everyone to afford. I do. however, 
have a deeper understanding of the 
money obsession now. The mosi im- 
portant ihing to remember about mon- 
ey is to not lcl it control you. Doo'i 
work so hard for those pieces of paper 
that you relegate your own power lo 
the pieces- And whenever possible, do 
not hide your cash inside your piqipy, 
especially if you're uninsured.

'Women's voices are important' 



By Ngo2l R. Rogers 

The leadings. 

One or a woman trying lo find the 
women in her family because (he 
history of her father, grandfailicr and 
other men were passed down and 
learned by each generation. 

Another about musicians, school 
teachers, writers and parents who 
were placed on death lists and had to 
flee Iheir homes, jobs and families. 
Some lied and lived. Some Dcd and 
died. Others chose lo stay, fight 
and possibly die. There 
names I couldn't pr 
nouncc. Names I won' 
do the injusiice of try- 
ing to spell. 

Many of the read- 
ings were poems 
and stories from 
Guaicmalaian 
women. 

Others were by 
North American 
women living in 
South America 
telling dicir experi- 
ences as people who 
are or were living 
there through the same 
conditions bul were siill 
somehow detached. 

The readings were aboui 
what human beings every- 
where arc forced to live through. 

Margaret Randall, author, poet, 
photographer, essayist, teacher and 
social activist, began touring with 
readings by women in the early 
1980's. Randall has lived in some of 
the countries from which ihe poems 
and siories originate, including Cuba 
and Nicaragua. She's written books 
in Spanish, produced 32 issues of a 
200-300 page bilingual magazine 
from 1962 Uirough 1969 and has au- 
thored nearly fifiy books. Her mosi 



reccni being "Gathering Rage: The 
Failure of Tweniieih Century Revo- 
lutions lo Develop a Feminist 

Agenda." 

On die evening of the readings, the 
campus, Walb and the room where 
Margaret Randall spoke were sur- 
prisingly quiei. The few sounds pre- 
sent were the 'whoosh' from the air 
duels, the creaking of Walb's wood 
'n wicker chairs and die sound of 
several 




girls outside the door. 1 had seen 
them on my way in and they ap- 
peared 10 be coming from the event 
in the ballroom. 

It was inieresiing lo me ihai while 
Margaret Randall was reading po- 
ems eniiUed, "Black Woman," "God 
Damn the Empty Sky," "Grenada" 
and "Lineage", all concerning 
women's lives and die lives of peo- 



ple she knew, were of interest to 
diese iilde girls who were beginning 
life. 

I wish they'd been able to peep 
through the door's window long 
enough to hear Randall say, 
"Women's voices arc imponant and 
worth listening lo. Women today are 
re -remembering our lives. Toni Mor- 
rison invented the phrase, ..in this re- 
remembering, we arc speaking our 
stories to one another and listening 
to each other. This is empowering to 
all of U.S." 

I wanted them to hear Jane 

Childs story of people in 

Guatamala who were killed. 

People who had liide girls 

just like themselves, 

li might have been 
tKneficial for the curi- 
ous ones to hear Ran- 
dall read an account 
written by a Black 
Carmdian Lesbian Po- 
et who was in Grena- 
da on the 25d] of Oc- 
tober when our coun- 
try arrived lo "restore 
democracy." Where 
'5000 U.S. soldiers and 
the American war ma- 
chine' fought 'farmers, free 
healdi care and education and 
women's cooperatives; where 
people watched their families go 
hungry.' 

How about them being allowed to 
stay long enough to eavesdrop on 
writer Daisey Zamora's poem, 'Lin- 
eage' that ends: "[She] Looks for 
herself for all of them, die women of 
[her) house." 

But they instead were shooed 
away. 
Too bad. 

Women's voices arc important,

Mallharpies reside at city hubs 



By Nathan Somers, 
Sla IT writer 
There are limes when even an ago- 
raphobiac like myself must go to the 
mall. Today. I have to venture deep 
into die bowels of the mall to retrieve 
a suit which I had altered. Before me 
the mall sprawls like a concrete ame- 
ba, its departments extending their 
groping pseudopods to engulf the oc- 
casional minivan. 1 park in die shad- 
ow of what appears to be a giant grit- 
flavored Sno-Cone. This particular 
sludgeberg might l&gt;e large enough lo 

Commentary 

resist mcUing until mid June. So if 
they're still finding mammoths and 
Flinistone families in permafrost. 
dien who knows what lies buried in 
these mounds? Forget cryogenics— 
bilry mc in a parking lot glacier. 

Even die trek across the parking lot 
has its perils; I am reminded of one of 
the tougher levels of Frogger, only 
the mall's alligators are more tena- 
cious. After dodging the blurred im- 
age of a Camaro and one runaway 
parked car, 1 reach the doors. Now I 
must face die unruly public. 

The mall has changed since I was 
here last; some of the obscure tran- 
sient businesses have disappeared to 
be replaced by new. obscure transient 
businesses. Bul the old pandieon of 
retail gods remain: Hudson's, Ayre's, 
MCL Cafeteria, even the enfeebled 
Sears. MCL Cafeteria is, of course, 
where old people come from. The el- 
derly arc still Fort Wayne's largest 
cj:port, and most of the retirees are 
siill being imported by Florida. Yes, 



despite the surface changes. Glen- 
brook remains the hub of Fori Wa)Tie. 
while Southtown Mall languishes as 
the place where retailers go to die. 
Every Christmas, mall dignitaries 
solemnly place a wreath at the doors 
of the Southtown Necropolis. 

My awe of Glenbrook's terrible 
beauty is suspended as I spy a survey 
woman standing on my beeline to the 
suit store, I press ahead, but she has 
chosen me as her prey. 1 attempt to 
use one of those chintzy jewelry 
booths as a shield, but she is not 
foiled. As our disiance closes, I feint 
right, then briskly step left — she 
matches my move perfectly. It's no 
good to outflank her; her reflexes 
have been honed to a vorpal edge by 
countless hours of public relations 
seminars, I charge towards her, but 
she retrogrades and begins her orato- 
ry: 

"Excuse me, sir! I'dliketoasky-. 
ouafewquestionsforasurveyii'llonly 
takeaminute!" 

"No lime. Musi hurry. Get suit," 1 
respond, attempting to avoid eye con- 
tact. 

This time I fake left, do a turn- 
around jumpshoi maneuver, and 
sprini right, I've escaped Uic mall- 
harpy, but I am troubled thai the mall 
not only allows solicitors, but also 
full-court press. 

Now I am approaching the Ice Rink, 
the traditional breeding grounds of 
mall rats. Defiant altemapunks usual- 
ly nest here, challenging audiority by 
growing sideburns and outsmoking 
each other. But now they stand con- 
fused and frightened because of ihe 
recent smoking ban. And to enforce 



thai law. mall cops patrol die halls. [ 
see one now, striding with all ihc dig- 
nity of a rodeo clown. It's ihose 
hats, you know. No one can respeci a 
cop who dresses Idtc Quickdraw Mc- 
Graw. To prove that point, two 
young loughs jeer at die Harma Bar- 
bara flatfooL If die kids aren't gang- 
members, they're trying hard lo look 
like it. They spon ihc insidc-oui 
plaid shins, an uzi t-shin. price tags 
on backwards caps, pacifiers, even 
die gangsu strut — a look more comi- 
cal than anyUiing created for A Clock- 
work Orange. Are so many people so 
insecure that they must compromise 
individuality for a cliquey uniform? 

I've finally made it to Ihe store and I 
pick up my suit. 1 will wear this suit 
10 job interviews. Now I loo can 
stand out by looking like everyone 
else.

Earth's beauty inspires 



By Michael Bass 
Sports Editor 

As ihc sun sets into the misty clouds 
hovering on ihe edge of the horizon I 
look down upon a litdc pink flower. It 
slowly rolls in a gentle breeze coming 
out of the wcsL A warm nectar Qlls ihc 
air with a perfume smell that wafts up 
slowly tingling my nostrils as they sense 
its petite presence. 

liie day is magnificently crafted with 

Commentary 

all the details of Ihc setting sun and 
rolling green plains ihal go on in all di- 
rections moving outward into an infinite 
haze. 

The flower alone on the plains is the 
only one of its kind. Its beauty stnkes a 
chord in my heart. The picture embla- 
zoned on my mind of Ihe sweei rolling 
blossom will be held dear by me till the 
day 1 die. 

Its every detail is cichcd out and com- 
plcicd in my mind's eye. Some nights I 
know 1 will wake up from having a 



dream about this flowa and swear I can 
smell its sweet nectar, 

A neciar that brings a warmth thai 
aawls all through my silhouette thai 
stands on ihe hilly grass plains. 

As Ihe sun sets into Ihe darkness and 
the flower scales down for the night, its 
shadowy form rises and lakes over the 
whole setting. No longer does die sun 
shine, but the majesty of ihis one rip- 
pling flower breaks forth holding its 
pose for all those who wish to behold its 
beauty 

Days will go by and ihe innocent 
flower will grow old, widicr and die, bui 
for now iLs reign over ihe plains is com- 
plete and undisturbed. 

I look up into the vast expanse and see 
the iwinkling of while dots trying to 
break forth into die darkness. They too 
wdl one day grow old, widier, and die, 
bui their radiance will shine for years 
and years after diey pass away. 

It is nature and I stand in awe before 
ils calm composure. I feel naked and 
weak, I feel strong and alive, but mosily 
I feel love for this grand planet we call 
earth. 



Protect our children's future, support recycling!

The IPFW women'* sofiball leam be- 
gan iu legulw season gunu in champi- 
oruhip fashion two wedu ago. 

Already pMting a 14-1 ovaall iccoid. 
5-0 in confeiencc. the leam looki 
ready lo compete for a conference 
championship. 

Dawn Freemen and Jennifer Martin, 
both seniors, lead the team by expcii- 
erKC and strong play. 

"The team works hard and plays to- 
gether. *e believe we can win confer- 
ence." Martin staled confidenily. 

Opening iheir season in Florida, the 
Lady 'Don; participated in a multi-slate 
invilalional lournamenl in which Ihey 
posted a 5-1 pool play record. 

The team was slued to be a top seed 
in the playoffs, but all the games were 
canceled due lo snow. 



The team's ofTenie was powered by 
Liz Caywood. batting around ,600 for 
the toumamenL 

The team continued their hot streak at 
home by winning their last nirtc games. 
In non-confeience games. IPFW beat 
Indianapolis 7-X 7-3 and Huntington 
d-2. 5-2, 

The big challenge for ihe 'Dons was 
the confeicTKe game versus Kentucky 
Weslcyan. a game described as a pitch- 
ing dual. Angie Quickery wis the no- 
table player for "Dons by throwing eight 
siiikeouls and only walking one. 

The game ended when Michelle Voli 
scored off a Liz Caywood hit 

The Kentucky Weslcyan game gave 
the 'Dons momentum which helped 
them bury Kentucky Stnte 24-2, 

Bellarmine was next in line to become 
the victim of Ihc Lady 'Dons play, los- 
ing by the score of 3-1. 



This past weekend the leam nsvelcd 
soulh. again, to play Southern Indiana 
and Norihcrn Kentucky. The 'Dons 
nailed over both Ieam5 9-4 and 9-3. 
respectively. 

Rhonda Colone was the hot hand for 
Ihc team, hitting 7 for 10 for ihe week- 
end games. 

The team is well focused on its goal of 
becoming confaoicc champions, as the 
game against Northern Kentucky 
proved; Coach Dale VanHouten was 
thrown out of the game for stepping on 
the field to check on an injured player, 
before time-out was called. 

When asked about the ejection of Van- 
Houten. Martin said, "The team did 
what it was supposed to do, everyone 
did their job and played the game 
together,"

The IPFW Mastodons men's tennis 
team began its conference season with a 
showdown against Bellarmine and Ken- 
lucky Suite. 

On March 27. ihe icam traveled to 
Kentucky State to play matches against 
Bcllannine and host school, Kcnnicky 
State. 

Both teams fell to IPFW's onslaughL 
Bellarmine lost lo the Mastodons 7-2. 
While Kentucky Stale couldn't win a 
match, losing 9-0, 

Agairul Kentucky Slate ihe Maitodtms 
were led by new recruit Scott Davis, 
who has ettmed the number one spot on 
the team. Davis beat Kentucky Slates 
Wayne Wissinton in two games; 6-1 and 
7-5. 

Davis, however, lost lo Bellnrmincs' 
number one man John Gcrvasio in two 
games; 3-6 and 4-6. 

This is Davis' first year at IPFW and 
first time holding the top spot on a Icam. 



Both Davis and coach Dan Btogan feel 
thai he is slowly making Ihe transition 
to the number one spot and handling the 
^dcd pressure well. 

"It's a lot of pressure and I need to 
leam to deal with it belter," said Davis. 

Coach Brogan feels that ihe problem is 
a menial one and will soon talcc care of 
iisclf. 

Overall, Brogan feels he has enough 
depth on the leam thai he can afford to 
wait for Davis lo make ihc transition. 

In doubles play against Bellarmine 
Davis showed his skill wiih partner Pat 
Didicr by beating Lee Phillips and Scoit 
Petlis in two games; 6-2 and 6-1 . 

The Davis-Didicr duo went on lo beat 



:ky States' Barry Johnson and 
Cover in two also; 6-0 and 6-1, 
Brogan feels that although it is early in 
ie season . the team can go a long way. 
"Wc really want to be in the top three 
1 our conference this year," said 



Keh 



Brogan feels the real challenge will be 
when they play Indianapolis. 

The leam is cmrcnily 2-0 in the con- 
ference and arc 4-3 overall. 

They will play ai IPFW on Saturday 
April 3, against Kentucky Stale and 
Lewis. The matches begin at 9:00 ejn, 
and will be ployed throughout the day.

The team defeated Loyola Mary- 
mount in four games, losing the first 
game 11-15. twt wem on to win the

On Saturday the team went head to

IPFW clawed Iheir way to a win in 
five gomes; 15-13.3-15. 16-14. 12-14. 



and 15-13. 

Against Stnla Barbara the team 
thowcd a lot of heart; after losing the 
second game 15-3 they found them- 
selves down 7-1 in the third game. 

They rose together to bring the game 
wiihin one ai 7-8, t«t then Santa Bar- 
bara surged ahead again to go up 13-7. 

Again, the Volleydons fought back 
into it wiih a suong defense led by 
Norman Almodovai. 

Almixlovai and the team went on a 
seven point run to take the lead and 
eventually came out with the win 
16-14. 

On Sunday the Volleydons hosied a 
smollet version of the Spring Fling
