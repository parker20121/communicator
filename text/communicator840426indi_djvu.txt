Student senate asks 
for course addition 



Admissions serve students planning changes 



By KATHLEEN SI. CBEVEN 
BUB Writer 

If individual attention in planning your academic program appeals la you. be 
sure to nolily Die admissions department of your Intentions to enroll, change 
your status or transfer as soon as possible. 

"We are as accommodating as possible in this depar orient," said Phillip A. 
Kennell. director ol admissions. 

"The primary function of Ihe admissions department Is to present the IPFW 
story lo prospective students," said Kennell. 

Literature about the campus, available programs and degrees is distributed 
to area high schools to be handled by the counselors at each facility These 
counselors sec to it that their studcnls complete all requirements for 
registration nell before Ihe registration deadlines These sludents make up60 
perrent of the first time enrollment per semester. 

Another 30 percent o( the first time students do not go through counselors, and 
come in to inquire about the admissions procedure as the deadline approaches, 
which causes ihe admissions personnel lo work even faster to admit these 
students. 

"This group of M percent who are admitted shortly before a designated 



deadline do 50 for a variety of reasons. They may have planned to go away to 
school only tofind Ihls impossible at the lasl minute They may find themselves 
separated from a Job or laken a Job where the employer pays a percentage of 
educational cosls,"saidKennell. 

These prospective students then have to scramhle for Iranscripls from high 
school and or college then wait lobe notified of acceptance to the university. 

An academic advisor must be found, a tentative class schedule arranged and 
approved — then the student may register, and pray lhal the hastily chce-en 
classes haven't already been filled. 

All of this, compacted into the hectic days prior to a registration session does 
not assure any student much administrative attention. 

Students who inlend lo transfer between III and Purdue must also be admitted 
to the alternate school before being assigned to an odvisor and completing the 
steps to register for classes 

The advice from the admissions department is to not assume thai paperwork 
takes care of llself. If you have any questions about transfers. regislraUon or 
gaining admittance lo IPFW programs, stop by the admissions office in Kettler 
Hall, across from the financial aid department. The stalf could save you from 
headaches (and worse) if you allow plenty of timeforyour transactions.

Encountering drunk drivers 



Earlier Ihis semester. The Com- 
municator published a series or articles 
dealing with drug and alcohol abuse. 

Along the same lines, though not 
directly related, a Mothers Against 
Drunk Drivers chapter was formed at 
IPFW. The goal of MAUD is to educate 
people about the dangers of drunk 
driving. 

Most people don't think of drunk 
driving until they have had an encounter 
wilh a drunk driver On April IB, three 
Fort Wayne residents had an encounter 
with a drunk driver. 

They were traveling west on U.S. 24 
between Toledo, Ohio and Napoleon, 
Ohio when they spoiled a pickup truck 
ahead of them swerving from side to 
bide. The driver and one of the 
passengers commented that the person 
driving the truck was either drunk or 
very tired or both. 

After following the car from Water- 
town toward Napoleon for about five 
miles, the truck missed a curve and went 
off the road. The truck knocked over six 
large wooden stakes along the road. 
Fortunately far the driver, there wasn't 
n ditch to drive into, only an abandoned 



The driver of the truck didn't realize 
what had happened when the three from 
Fori Wayne stopped to see if he was all 
right. When he got out of his truck, a can 
of beer fell out of the cab onto the 
pavement. The truck was totaled. The 
left fender had come off, the front end. 
which had been white, was smoking and 
black. The truck smelled like a fire and 
the driver reeked of alcohol. 

The driver was about 20 or so miles 
from home when he went off the road. He 
lives on a back country road somewhere 
west of Napoleon. What would have 
happened had he not had his accident 
there? What would have happened had 
those three Fort Wayne residents not 
gone to the hockey game in Toledo that 
night? We may have seen on the 6 
o'clock news lhal next day another 
traffic fatality in Ohio 

With the semester about to end, there 
will be plenty of opportunities to drink 
during the summer Some of us will 
drive drunk, others of us won't. 
Hopefully those of us who do drink won't 
drive, and we'll let someone sober do the 
driving.
