from their commencement cer- 
emony straight mto the night- 
marish landscape and work 
drudgery of "Office Space " 

And some have better 
experiences. Justin Busch is 
thinking he'll have a belter 
experience- He's going to the 
White House,

ing coffee, Busch already has a 
specified job. He will be intern- 
ing for the Office of Liaison for 
the While House. 

"They deal with religious 
groups and think tanks. . other 



groups that support the

with the entertainment 
world when Ihey come to 
visit the president." he said. 
Busch will be working 
for a special assistant for the 

Gesid(?nl in the Office of 
aison, and believes that 
will give him a fulfilling 
cxpencnce. 

"T will be doing some

Pep band STOMPs its way toward another season 



By Melissa Rentfrow 
Guest IVrilrr 

The IPFW pep band, 
STOMP, will be recruiting new 
members for the fall semester 
after a successful inaugural year. 
The band has come a long wav 
from its conception last year, 
playing at 20 home games ilii:- 
past season including most 
men's baskelball games, somv 
men's volleyball games and 
women's basketball games. 

The response lor the IPFW 
STOMP band has been over- 
whelmingly positive," said 



Barry Slurglll, director and 
recent IPFW graduate with 
BSEd in _ U.S. history and 




n the musical needs of the band, ' 
With so many supporters among the tacully, 
staff, athletes and fans, Slurgill hopw to draw more 
participation from the IPFW student body to Iheband 
in the future. The band currently has IH members 
from last season, but Sturgill wants lo increase that 
number to 50 or more, 

"My goal is to get bigger and belter and become 
an inlcgral part of IPFW," Sturgill said. 

Weissner notes that while all instruments are 

invited, some instruments are parliculnilv needed to 

idoutSTOMP'ssound Wfh.ii

English. "Every coach at IPFW 
has made a point of telling us 
what a great addition we make 
lo IPFW athletic events." „,, , ,„ r, n 

Aimie Weissner, a commu- ., . .^ mri.i, r-. n ■ .. .... 

nications specialist in University- Members of IPFW's Slomp Band attempt to bnng up thi 

Relahons and Communications crowd's energy at a home athletic event. 

ivho helped with Ihe planning 

and organization of the band, also noted apprcciatit 

from IPFIV athletes, 

"DeAngelo Woodall and Brad Noll llPf^V men 
basketball players] were the t^vo main ones who can 
up to us at every game," she said. "They would con 
and thank us and 'high fi&gt; ' 



Guitarist Healhet Ehrman mentioned thai the 
band often became an integral part of the games. 
"Athletes liked our presence." she said, "fesides 
playing, there were many hmcs when the band 
would heckle the other teams and the athletes seemed 
to get a smirk on their faces from that." 

Alto saxophonist Matthew Ehrman (and 
Heather's brother) agreed that athletes approved of 
the musical addition to the competitions. "Tliere (vere 
times they would bo disappointed to hear we would 
not be playing at one of their games," he said. 

Baritone sax player Lindsey Saltaz felt that the 
band helped lo boost the attitude and game perform- 
ance of Ihe Mastodon players. "We have... gotten a lot 
of good feedback from the team." she said 'There is 
a difference in the way the team plays when we are 
there, and it is fun for us as well." 

Crowds attending Ihe games last year were also 
pleased with Ihe band. Salla/ said. "We weren't real- 



Slurgill received many positive comments from 
IPFW supporters, "Many sports fans have told us (ve 
sound great and how good it is to have live music and 
support that a pep band brings lo athlettcs," he said. 

The great respoi«e from all made all Ihe hard 
work and preparation worthwhile. "Since this 
ivas our first year, everything has been difficult 
including linding the musiciaiu. finding practice and 
storage space and deciding ivhal games we would 
play for,' Slurgill said. 

Once all of this was orgaiuzed, there was also the 
matter of choosing the music, but Sturgill found that 
to be an easy task, "Choosing the music really isn't 
that difficult," he said, "I chose tunes that were crowd 
favorites such as the theme from "Coach." the "Hey 
Song- and 'TfMCA." 

Slurgill also took requests from those organizing 



thebarid, band members and other band directors. "I 
think we came away with a nice variety of music to 
play" 

Sturgill also wrote "Mastaslomp," the official 
IPFW pep song used to bring the teams onto the fioor 
before the games start and during halftime. "I'm ver^' 
proud of how it turned out," he said. "Since IPRV is 



now my alma mater, I 
am donating 

'Mastastomp' to the 
school as my way of 
giving a little some- 
thing pack to the uni- 
versity." 

Another simple 
part of Sturgill's task 
STOMP 



mto trumpets one an^i i

we had a trombone." -Ill' -.Ji.i i\. .i. (-. r.ituly need 
more low brass for ftlnsj year . We iJidii i h.ive any 
baritone, ond we didn't have any tuba, ' 

Also included in the band is a bass guitar, and 
Weissner said ihat fortunately Heather Fhrman plays 
guitar, which adds the sound of the missing brass, 
"We are... hurting in the low brass area," VVcissner 
said. "We were begging people lo drag their friends 
and other band directors lo come in and cover for us 
ivhen Ihey could." 

Sturgill and the band members encourage incoming 
students to team more about the band and gel 
involved.

Two IPFW professors receive Fulbrights 

Vasquez and Pomalaza-Raez will study abroad next year 



Two IPFVV professors have 
received rare and prestigious 
academic honors this year. The 
first is IPI^ physics professor 
Dcsidario Vasquez. 

Vasauez wilt be teaching 
and doing research during 
spring semester 2004, but he 
won't tie in his usual classroom 
in Kctllei Hall. Vasquez is one of 
BOO United States facully and 
professionals who will be going 
to 140 countries lo teach and do 
research as Fulbright Scholars. 

Vasoucz wiir be going to 
Urvivcrsidad Catolica del Peru 
In Lima where he will develop a 
research program in computa^ 
lional fliud dynamics and Icacli 
a course in computational 
physics. He says Ihe Fulbrighl 
scholarship will "certainly 
strengthen Ihe academic con- 
tacts I already have... and will 
be a unique opportunity for me 
lo teach hlgh-quaL'ty students. 
The students will receive hands- 
on experience in deRning, ana- 
lyzing and solving actual 
research problems." 

Vasquez has been a profes- 
sor at IPFW since 1993. He 
received his bachelor's degm: in 
' physics from Universidad 
Catolica del Peru in I9SZ and his 
Ph.D, in physics from the 
Universily of Notre Dame in 
1989. Before coming to IPRV, 
Vasquez did post -doctoral 
research in W^l Virginia and 
Texas. 

The Fulbrighl program is 
sponsored by the United States 
iJepartment of Stale, Bureau of 
Educational and Cultural 
Affairs. It is administered by the 
Council for Inlemalional 
Exctiangc Scholars. The scholar- 
ships pay for one scmesler's 
sal a n^ travel and supplies. 

The second professor, 
IPFW electrical enginecringpro- 
fessor Carlos A. Pomaloza^ez. 
is one of only 12 college profes- 



n the country tc 






of only 

ttvo of the 12 who has been 
awarded the grant for Ihe entire 
academic year. 

The gram for electronics, 
information and telecommuni- 
cation technology at the 
University of OuFu, is a joint 
effort with Nokia, a Finnish cor- 
poration, which is also the 
world's largest mobile commu- 
nications company. Pomalaza- 
RiQz says he applied for a 
Fulbrighl grant to Finland, 
"tjccause in my area of ivork, 
wireless com mur\iea lions, there 
is no place more advanced in Ihe 
world than Finland." 

Pomalaza-Riez was a visit- 
ing professor at the University 
of Oulu in 1997-98, and is very 
familiar with Ihe countiy, its 
people and language. "Oulu, 
which means salmon, is located 
vcrv close to the Arctic Circle 
and Lapland. An important food 
of the people who live there is 
salmon, which come from Ihe 
Oluluyoki River that runs 
through the city." 

I\]ma1aza-Rdcz noted thai 
he and Vasquez are both nalives 
of Peru; TOsquoi! Is from Ihe 
Pacific coast of that country, 
while Pomalaza-RAez is from 
the highlands in Ihe Andes 
Mountaiiu. He has been a pro- 
fessor at IPFW since J989. Before 
that, he was a member of the 
lechnical slaff at Ihe Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in 
California, a professor at 
Clarkson University in New 
York and a lecturer at Ihe 
Universily of Limerick in 
Ireland. 

He received bachelor's 
degrees in electrical and 
mechanical engineering from 
the Universidad Nacionale de 
Ingenieria in Lima, Peru, and a 
master's and doctorate from 



I'urdue University'. 

For over aO years, the 
Council for International 
Exchange of Scholars (CIES) has 
helped adminislcr Ihe Fulbrighl 
Scholar Program, the United

Ihe battle for smaller

mysourccs tell me these folks aresurc to be on

Campus Ministry is also a very influential and 
popular group. You have to keep in mind that 
while yo\x may be leaving your parents behind 
when you come to college, you should remember 
lo bring Cod [or Jehovah or Allah) along with 
vou. It^ good lo know thai should your spirit 
become troubled, vou always have someone lo

Drawbacks of on-campus eating 



It's noon at IPFW and as a 
typical college student who has 
hccn cramming for a big exam, 
you are hungry. What are your 
choices for lunch? As we see it, 

fnu have five choices: Subway, 
izza Hut, packing, vending 
machines and leaving campus. 
Each of these choices has meir 
drawbacks. 

At Subway, you can wait in 
tine for up to 10 minutes and 
purchase overpriced tunchmeat 
clad with watery vegetables, 
making the day-old bread 
soggy, or you can choose from 
their nol-so-wide variety of 
soups. You can get these appe- 
tizing selections at either of the 
tivo locations here on campus. 
This raises the question: why in 
the world do we have iwo 
Subways anyhow? Don't get us 
wrong. Subway does take the 
hunger away and is a healthy 
choice — at least (ated says so. 
But eating Subway five days a 
week is boring. 

If that doesn't sound appe- 
tizing, you can always go to Ihe 
Student Union to cat at Ihe 
campus Pizza Hut. At Pizza Hut 
you gel Ihe choices of an 
already -made personal pan 
pizza, crusty pasta or salad bar 
with a limited selection. The 
piua. while it might hit Ihe 



™ 






nealthy If you want a drink 



from either Subway or Pizza 
Hut. you will pay at least S1.09. 
and if you are still thirsty and 
not sneaky enough lo elude the 
cashier's scrutiny, pay fifty cents 
for refills. 

Of course, if you are super 
ambitious, as your third choice 
you can pack your lunch. This 
involves not only planning, but 
also carrying vour lunch around 
with yoii airday, which adds to 
the tj^ical 30 pounds oF books 
that are already splitting llie 
seams of your backpack- 
Depending on the time you 
can access your lunch, it may 
either be spoiled or mashed 
beyond recognition. There is 
also the option of leaving your 
lunch in the car, kvhich can be 

3uile a hike to retrieve, and 
epending on the weather, 
eilner freezer burned or melted. 
The fourth option is to buy 
overpriced snacks out of the 
vending machines located in 
every building. If you are into 
fine vending cuisine, you can 
walk lo Ihe Helmke Library and 
dine on some good eals such as 
Lunchables and p re-made sand- 
wiches. These venues are loaded 
with calories and prescri'atives, 
not to mention questionable 
expiration dates. Last lime we 
checked, soft drinks, pretzels 
and cold Pop-tarls are not an 
appctizinglunch. 

The fifth option is leaving 
campus and picking up some 
fast food at a drive-thru or. if 
you have time, find a sit-down 
restaurant. If that option sounds 



: of long Imes or slow service. 
The downfall being that you 
will most likely lose your rela- 
tively close parking space that 
you earned by getting lo school 
at eight in the morning and 
therefore be late to or even miss 
class. Hmm, maybe this choice 
isn't so bad after all. 

The problem at hand is that 
here we have a lack of choices of 
where lacat while gaining our. 
education? Besides Ihc fact that 
most of these choices are expen- 
sive, thej' are also unhealthy. We 
find it mtercsting that sevi^ral 
weeks ago. there was a health 
fair on campus to promote 
healthy diets and exercise. Or 
was it just an advertisement for 
Subway to have Jared come and 
make an appearance. 

We enjoy junk food as 
much as the next person, but 
wouldn't it be rtice to have a 
cafeteria to pick up a balanced, 
nutritious or even hot meal for 
atMUt the same price or less Ihan 
at Subway or Pizza Hut? 

[f vou would enjoy having 
the cafeteria back or even a 
different choice of food on cam- 

our student government. You 
know who we are talking about, 
those people who were handing 
out cookies, candy, pieces of 
,vith 
ingyou 
lo vole lor them.

ble advice to those who alill have a few years left 
at IPFW. 

First off, I'd like to thank the administra- 
tion. Chancellor Wartell and his staff have been 
nothing but great to myself and student govem- 
menl. I appredale also being treated Tike an 
equal wilh the chancellor and lurge all who feel 
as though his opinion could be of help to seek it. 
It has truly been a joy to work wilh you, Dr, 
Warldl, Equally as easygoing has been the dean 
of students, Donna Biallk. Dr. B. knows almost 
everything, and if the rare occurrence happens 
when she doesn't, she knows exactly who to call 
or where to look it up. Thanks so much for your 
kindness and guidance. Donna — I will miss you 
very much. I will also miss my time spent wilh 
the ladies of Student Life. 1 think this office will 
play a major role in IPRV's continual march to 
becoming a fun place where students want lobe, the way. CODOl 
LB. Audrey and Linda, I cannot Ihink of three 
finer ladies to take on such a lofty task. 

I'd also like to thank my colleagues at 
Student Government. Thanks for the laughs and 
the memories. I know I leave this body in good 
hands. Matt, John, Caroline and Erin, I wish you 
nothing but the best, and I am confident that you 
will be great leaders. President Shilling, 1 can 
think of no other person I'd rather see lake my 
old office Ihan you. I am really proud of you, if 
you ever need anything. I'd be there for you. To 
my Chief of Staff Oscar Miison. 1 thank you for 
all your help and the long nights of going over 
paperwork m the office. 

If these ne(v officers have any questions. 
you can always call me. But I think it would be 
more advantageous to just ask Holly Laura. She 
was the real leader up there — I am really going

The happy and bitter battle: The struggle of love and relationships 



Low is a beautiful Ihing, as I believe I have 
had il once or twice in my life. Where Ihis may 
seem insignificant lo many, those were the oiJy 
occasions when I wa:; certain of what I was saying. 
1 am i.ilhiT appii'lii'ii'.ivi' when it comes lo throw- 
ing thi.' '.' '!.&lt; I"" ii nmeone else. And while 
then .II' - tor my doing so, one

How iTiiinv lime^ have you listened to your 
friends at the end ol a lelephone conversation tell 
Ihcir significant olherof a few weeks that Ihey love 
Ihcm? Or is thai a bit dim-willed t&gt;ecausc you hear 
il so often that you have learned to accept II as an 
ordinary i;oodbye? 

My interest in writing this ivas piqued when a 
friend of mine came to me wondering what she 
could do for her boyfriend on his birthday — 
something romantic Ihal would spark a little more 
lire in their relalionship. I asked her if she had told 
him that she loved him. She said that she had, and 
1 could only shake my head, knowing there was 
one mure person who had hastily concluded that 
she loved her significant other in such a small 



understand thai relationships can flourish, and 
love can exist in just a few short months, but tvhat 
is lite solution for waking up someday and realiz- 
ing Ihat you really do love the one you are with? 
You can't likely go up to them and tell them you 
really love them or thai you love them and mean it 

The most common complaint that I hear from 
people Is that they can't just go around trusting 

lo c 



liencc or evasiveness? Whether il be love of Ihe 
idea of having a relationstup, out of mere sexual 
fruslrah'on or out of loneliness, if you have super- 
fluously given your heart and your love, what is 
Icfl to give? I don't Ihink I need to lay il out for 
mosi of you, but of the people left in this world 
who arc not entirely indifferent about basing a 
relalionship on sex, you are Ihe ones who know 
what my purpose in writing Ihis is about. For the 
rest of you, if you move too quickly, there may be 
mueli at slake. The pressure lo surrender your 
moralit)' in exchange lor recovery from giving too 
much ol yourself too quickly may prevail over 



instant gratification we have everyivheiv else thai 
drives us lo think that relationships can be goiien 
just as easily? I could, wilhoul dllflcully, go out 
and meet a girl and afler two months cover ever&gt;' 
angle that a Iwo-year relationship could cover, but 
why would I want lo risk moving loo rapidly lur 
trust lo develop, particularly il I am as interested 
as I say I am? My advice to anyone Is lo keep 
appteciating the advantages ive have in our society. 
"Instant gratification" is an integral part ol our

you. 



We I 



rather 



idicutous world where 



jump into their car and get anywhen; in a matter of 
minutes, I believe it has damaged the amount of 
time Ihal we think relationships take lo develop. I 



learning expci 

I ivlll grant you that. Nevertheless, I can't 
keep count of the numerous people who look to 
me lor advice who are repeating this same dread- 
lul mistake many times over Unforlunalely, Ihe 
result can be severe psychological and emotional 
damage. As through the course of events, we then 
end up with a mass ol people ivho refuse lo trust 
anyone and allow themselves lo be in a relation- 
ship. (And if Ihey do, ifs on false pretenses.) Tile 
end rc-sull being people who have only a glint ol a 
dream ol whal a relalionship should be, and sadly 
will never know its Irueness because of a choice 
they made: lo make haste when it was Ihe ivorsl 
conceivable idea Ihey could have had. 

Unfortunately, there is a bigger problem than 
this. When and if you actually start lo have those 
true feelings of love, what is left to give of )'Ourself

Slaff Writers 

We love how people drive! 
They always use lum signals. 
They never tailgate other driv- 
ers. We can barely hear Iheit 
music shallerinc our eardrums. 
Most ol all, we love how people 
never, ever talk on iheir cell 
phones while driving. 
:' Wi; are IPfW students who 

; commute to and from school 
and work every day, so we do 
our fair share of driving. 
Between the four of us, wc drive 
' over 350 miles per week in town, 
and wc cannot help but notice 
how horrible most people drive. 
We can barely drive to 
school without seeing al leasl 
one other driver talking on a cell 
phone. We admit it. We are 
guilty, loo. All ol our experiences 
combined, ive have caused a 
tvreck, come close lo hilling a 

Eolice car, nearly run over a 
iker and ran a fe(v red lights — 
', all because we tvcre preoccupied 
by something in the car. Unlike 
_ most people, we are nol going to 
; limit these dislractioiB just to 
&gt; cell phones alone. There are 
I other interruptions for drivers 
*j such as eating and loud music. 
^ Who has time lo sit down 

•\ and have a meal? Our guess is 
•; not many people even eat al 
*; home once a day. if at all So. 
'• wtrere is ei'eryone eating — in

l', to drive while eatiiu then Big 
■ ; Macs, holding their fiench fries,

'!■ pie ivould slow down enough to

and would be able lo pay atten- 
tion to their driving instead. 

So they finally pul doivn 
Iheir Big Macs, only lo crank up 
a songon Ihe radio. People don I 
usually consider loud music a 
distraction, but who can really 
do their best impersonation of 
Mick I agger while navigating 
down a four-lane highway? 

People realize they need to 
turn douTi the loud music, only 
because they see Iheir cell 
phones lighting up and need to 
ansiver the call. Once again they 
are thinking about something 
other than driving. Instead ol 
eating food or jamming lo the 
loud music. Ihey are making 
plans fur the weekend. As the)' 
engage in conversation, Ihey are 
not aivare of other drivers, traf-

Not only are these dish-actions

when others do not lake driving 
seriously for those who are pay- 
ing attention tvhilc driving —

According to the BCC's Web

the university community. Out 
focus will be to explore the rich 
heritage and culture of African- 
Americans, to draw knowledge 
and strcnelh from this history 
and 10 celebrate the li\'es and 
contributions of our people. II is 
through learning that we create, 
build and find hope for a tetter 
future, and a ricner university 

BCC is perhaps t&gt;est known

When plana for expansion at iFFW begin several yeara batk. many were tkepliol about this new 
idea to nuLr the imivcnity mote ompui-oriented- When Chancellor Michael W^ttell and Vice 
rmideni of Financial Alfain Walt Branson made it clear that TPFW was to become more of a real uni- 
■lily. pw&gt;ple wondered how Uiey vrtiuld plan to move away from the commuter campus image. 

Expected lo toit &amp;Z}-SZ4 million, the Student Hm&amp;og Initiative wasa plan lo have more students 
participatt- on campus, by having them living in dorms located across Credent- The corwtruction of Iht 
using iuelf was pbnned lo bc»n in the summer of 2H01 and be completed this fall 

However, due to financial iisucs, the groundbreaking for the new dorms was pushed back to thL's 
■prmg and further delays have ptuhcd the official groundbreaking back to early summer. 

But while Ihe inoncy was not around to begin work on the donns. it was available to begin work 
on Ihe pedestrian bridge that would cross Crescent. The initial groundbreaking ceremony was held on 
Oct. 10. Wartell and other state dignitaries took part in the ceremony for Ihe bridge that carried a price 
lag of just under $2 million. 

Slncelheplansfor the brfdge and dorms, the athletic dcpartincnl also made strives to make IPnV 
more mainstream with their annual Homecoming week in October. The event included a showdown 
wilh FtjUer (whf&gt; went on to be one of the finsl 16 teams in the NCAA loumamenl) at Ihe Memorial 




CoU^eum. fi^owed bi,- a performance by Ota Da&gt; Jttd Ifw MM^hts ol 'Animal Houm.'' lamc. 

Changing student demographics «-ere the main driiing factor in the intweM to creatif the a 
campus housing, according to Braruon. Between the tears 1''95 and I^IW, (he prmnuge ol Mudents 
from surrounding counbes w ho attend \F¥Vf rose from 2T S pemml to 30.1 pcicvnl. while tuU-ltnvr stu- 1 
dents in that span grew to number 5,213. 

IVhen the initial decision forhousnig was nude,oneol the main hurdkswM how tnaclty to work I 
around Crescent Avenue. After several proposals, the decision was mAdc to construct d susp«itslcn:l 
bridge for pedestrians. To reach across the busy strwt. the bridge was built to b« 250 hM long, ivlth th 
suspensions as high is 100 feet in the air. 

The bridge will be built with funding through Ihe Transportation Equity Ad (or the 21»t CW)IU 
rrEA-21) grant. Within thisgranl, ihelncal governing agcnc&gt;' (in this case, the Indiana Department o) 
Transporta linn) will fund 80 percent of the cof\structian of the bridge, while imv will only be nspotis 
sible for 20 percent 

As of press time, hopes are thai the construction of the bridge will be 1(W percent complete by Ihe'l 
time fall semistcr begins in late August. Construction will begin on the residence hjlls oxer Ihn 9Uin-,| 
mer and are planned for use in Fall of 201&gt;I-

Due to ide fact that the entire bridge is irtade ot struc-

"Cold Slone" b«ause they mix the ice cream for Ihe customer on a 
cold Slone and that prevents the topping from melting fast. 
rcrsonally, I prefer lo eal ice cream somewhere else because I did 
nol Ihink il tasted very good. However, the place was crowded and 
obviously manv people enjov Ihe ice cream at Cold Slone 
Creamery.

When you walk up lo the window at the Willshire Drive-In, 
you'd swear the plaa' hasn't changed in 30 years — and according 
to Ihe people who frequent Ihe small-lown ice cream shop, it has- 
n't. The Drive-In is located on the comer of US 33 and Ohio State 
Road 81 — a bit out of the way for most Fori Wayne residcnL-i, but 
well worth the drive on a warm summer evening. 

The drivc-ln (which isn't really a drive-in: you park in the 
back, walk up lo Ihe windows lo order and eal al picnic tables 
under an awning) serves the typical ice cream fare including soft 
serve, hand-dipped, flurries, sundaes and shakes Prices sk excel- 
lent with a hot fudge sundae for less than S2 and a large banana 
split lor about S3. Portion are huge — a "jumbo" si/e ice cream cone 
hardly fib through Ihe opening in the window, They also have a 
large assortment of food including burgers, fries and Iheir specialty — 
coney di^. The service is fast and friendly, making this a great des' 
tlnallon for a short road trip on a summer day. 



DeBrand Fine Chocolates 



Dairy Queen 

TT1 



Dairv Queen is the popular place for ice cream for those who 
are on a budget. Many people stop by Iheir drive-thru to gel ice 
cream. Bui Ihe atmosphere is more conducive 10 Utile League 
teams than lo the ice cream coiuioisseur. They serve food and Inat 
may distract the customer's desire for ice cream. The smell of the 
frying oil makes you not want local icecream. However. Iheir Oreo 
Blizzard wilh chocolate ice cream is lasly and they give you a good 
amount — if you're really hungry, you can tirisn il. Their pnce is 
cheap compared to Cold Slono, out the lu.iury and atmosphere just 
aren I the same. 

The Main Street Soda Shoppe

The Whippy Dip 

T T T T 

Localed in the tiny loivn of Monroeville. Ihe Whippy Dip 
offers a lariety of ics cream products along &gt;vilh ga'al fooo. Fmm 
sundaes lo flurries (Whippy Dip's superior version of Ihe DQ 
Bli/.zard), Ihe Whippy Dip adds lis oivn unique touch to your aver- 
age ice cream shop. 

The first item 1 tried was a hot fudge sundae. Priced at a rea- 
sonable S1.40, it was quile delicious. Topped wilh an abundance of 
nuLs and whipped cream, the large portion of ice cream satisfied 
my lasle buds. Houevcr. there was no cherrs' on lop and I would 
nol call Ihe hoi fudge "hot" — il was closer lo warm, 

I was, however, completely satisfied ivilh my second selection. 
The Lemon Lime Ice Cream Slush is now my favorite dessert. At 
only S1.41. this huge slush (finely shaved ia-) is almost overloaded 
with a gigantic portion of sofi ser\'e ice cream and comes in a variety 
of flavors. Scrumptious! Tlic Whippy Dip has a small enclosed area 
where vi'u c.m nrdir itom hvo Windows, or they have drive-thru. 
Altliou);h iht MTV III' IS .1 liitle slow, I would gladly wail for any of 

Thf tniiiom lini lifre is that you can't possibly go wrong when 
you're ealiog icl' kicim. Dut If vou're looking for a litlle variety, a 
louch of class, or a Inp off Ihe beaten path, give one of Ihesc great 
places a try. 



ttTTT 



Okay, so ll's not an ice cream shop. It's a chocolate shop. But 
one lasteof their sundaes, and you'll nei'er want lo go back loplain 
ol' ice cream again. You walk inio DcBrand's and are immediately 
overcome by the rich brown and gold dikor and the pervasive scent 
of — you guessed il — chocolate. 

You almosl have lo lasle this stuff to believe il! A single scoop 
of vanilla bean ice cream sits in a chocolate dish. Choose any lop- 
pings you want — my favorites are raspbenj'. caramel ancl dark 
chocolate. The toppings are drizzled across ice cream, chocolate 
bowl and serving plate alike, making il almosl too pretty to eat. 
Add yiiur favorite nuls, and dig in! Mmm.... 

the price of a Di'Br.ind's sundae is a liltlc on the high side at 
around SS, bul Ihe ice cream is definitely a step above Dairy Queen 
and well worth Ihe extra couple of bucks. Besides, unless you've 
skipped dinner and headed straight for di-ssect, it's almosl loo 
much for one person lo polish off alone. 

Cold Stone Creamery 

T T T 

Cold Stone Creamery is one of the most popular places that 
serves ice cream in the area. It's located at Jefferson Poinle in from 
of the movie theater, which gives il great opportunity lo succeed. 
Many people might get ice cream on their way lo Ihe movie or 
while Ihcy are shopping. It is a long walk from the car to Ihe shop, 
but il is pleasant enough in thesummertime — tresides, you'll need 
Ihe walk back to the car lo work off all the ice cream you just ale! 
The size of their small ice cream is more than enough — 1 bel 



Entering Ihe Main Street Soda Shoppe, located in downtown 
Kendailville, feels like stepping back through lime. 'Theatmcwphere 
is just like those ice cream parlors of the 1950s. There is a picture of 
James Dean on Ihe wall by the door, and numerous other pictures 
of famous people. 

The night Ihal 1 went there, Ihe Ihree teenage girls working 
just seemed to want to talk lo each other, although one did look up 
and grecl me when I entered Ihe shop. "The service is kind of slow, 
bul the ice cream makes up for it. The scoops are so fiball -sized, and 



the i&lt; 



. The price seemed reasonable for 
the portion size, about %1 for a single scoop. 

The sundae I tested had just tnc right amount of caramel and 
pecans. II also came with the whipped cream and cherry — defiiulely 
a plus in my book. They also had a wide variel)' of toppings — 
whatever you enjoy 05 your sundaes, they have il. 0\'erall. Ihis is 
a great place to gel good ice cream al a good price. 



Felger's Perfect 
Blend

The smell of fresh- made cof- 
fee is Ihe first thing you notice 
when you walk in the shop, locat- 
ed in downtown Kendailville, just 
one block from Ihe Main Shx-et 
Soda Shoppe. That is because this 
is not only an ice cream place, in 
fact it is more' of a coffee shop. It 
kind of has that cozy feeling like 
you would have in your living

Power Index, which we need to hai'e 
them do. The other sports have all 
shown progress If 1 \vere to define a 
singular accomplishment though, it 
would have to be our grades," 

Pope set a goal last fall of a 3,0

department finished Ihe semester just 
below that goal with a 2.98 GPA, 
while the campus average was 2.66 
A perfect 4.0 GPA was achieved by 1 3 
student athletes. 

"When I sel that department- 
wide goal, people laughed at it. ' 
Pope said, 'People said thai athletics 
could never come close to that, but 
we came real close to it."

classroom and on Uie playing field, 
several of IPFW's athletes faced ihe

they engage in unwavering con-

clubs and hopeful athletes. 
Common mutliod* include tele-

when a lormc-r JPFW foreign ath- 
lete contacts an interested

her to commit lolPRV. 

"The interesting part is how 
these athletes find out about the 
university Some will use VVcb 
sites or hearsay from plavers 
from Iheir hometown; others 
send out workout tapes lo show 
coaches what they've got," said 
IPFW Sports Information 
Director Mike Icivell. 



Volleyball coaches Amie 
Ball and Kelley Hartley have 
established recnjiting "hotbeds" 
in Puerto Rico and Brazil, respec- 
tively. In fact, four of the men on 
the nwler — Dennis Santiago, 
Angel Ruiz-Rivera, Arcangei 
Ruiz and Jailer Garcia — came 
from Puerto Rico and one of the 
women — Fabiana Souza — 
came from Brazil. Ball has made 
a plethora of cont.icts over liis

also made me feel more comfort-

Ihat we need to take advantage 
of." 

Also, coaches will tie able to 
use the iwwly renovated venue 
as a recruiting tool.

nitely be a huge impact for us in

The next step in easing the 
process is to shield the athlete 
from the media for &gt; 



"You don't want lo throw 
them in front of the local news- 
paper or television if their 
English is so-^o." lewell said. 
"You want lo give them time to 
build up their speaking abilities 
and confidence so they don't feel 
like they look or sound silly" 

The IPFW campus-wide 
model aims at a more personal- 
ized, one-on-onc involvement 
with students. Athletics is no 
enception. In fact, one of Athletic 
Director Mark Pope's priorities 
is to apply Ihat approach from 

"Every student-athlete who 
comes through our campus 
knows thai my door is always 
open." he said. "We try to locus 
and pride ourselves on the indi- 
vidualized care and treatment of 
a foreign student-athlete because 
it is a very intimidating process — 
Hrst of all, coming to the U5. and 
then competing at a D-1 level." 

Pope's view of an "open- 
door policy" allows all studenl- 
athletes, foreign or domestic, to 
converse with him about any 
issue he or she may have. 

Once the foreign student- 
athlete settles in, he begins to 
prove the reasons behind his 
recruitment. Because volleyball, 
soccer and tennis tend to be 
more popular in counbies out- 
side of the United Stales, the for- 
eign recruits generally have a tal- 
ent edge on the homegrown ath- 
leles. 

"Usually they come in with 
tietter volleyball skills than their 
U S. counterpart. Therefore, their 
opportunity lo contribute to our 
program immediately is 
greater," Ball said. 

Often times Ihe athlete has 
played the sport since childhood 
days. In Souza's case, she has 
been playing for eight years in a 
tountr^' Ihat consitfirs volleyball

Jewell thinks because of 
'.htir enpericnces, their priorities

It is Ihe way they were 
brought up. It all comes back 
irnm family background, tradi- 
tiiinjlly. hard working," he says. 
Most of those kids have lo go to 
•.thool and work to support Ihe 
family. Their priorities are 
straight; whereas if you are kid 
from the United States, a lot of 
them arc fed with a golden 

Foreign athletes' influences 
jre felt more stalwarlly al IPFW, 
However, it expands beyond 
campus bound anes. 

"It brings a different culture 
into Ihc Umted Slates Ihat you 
may not see unless you are in 
New York or Miami," Jewell 
said. "In Fori Wayne, typically 
you aren't going to find people 

Ihc fact that recruiting will bene- 
fit ttemendouslv," said IPFW 
men's basketball coach Doug 
Noll. "When you bring a kid into 
Ihe Coliseum, he's awestruck. 
We'll be able to compete against 
the Ball States and the Butlers." 

Along with men's basket- 
ball, the women's basketball 
team will play at least two 
games at the Coliseum. 

There is also a chance that 
IPFW will add two sports next 
year in men's and women's golf, 

"There is no doubl in my 
mind that this communi^ 
thrives on golf, and it docsn t 
make a lot of sense to me not to 
have a golf program at IPFW," 
Pope said. "We've been in con- 
tact with a couplcof people who 
are going to provide us the 

decent golf pro^m. I will not 
start a sport without sufficient 
resources to make it successful. 
That was ttte mistake in irack." 

Finally. Pope is pushing for 
aU IPnV teams lo compete at the 
mid-major level and finish with 
a .500 record at that level. 

"That recjuires two things. 
It requires coaches to scheduJe 
intelligently and for us to be able 
to compete at the mid-major 
level." he said. "If we go out and 

Elay the Purdues and Notre 
lames of the world, we're going 
10 get beat But if we go out and 
schedule the mid-ma|ors in an 
intelligent hishion and give our 
kids a chance lo compete and 
win. I think we will."

CVQ1 Canada.You arc going to 
get a diverse culture, learn aboui 
their background, what they do 
tor fun and it is very interesting 
to find out the le\'el of play in 
other countries from heit.' 

The true college evpenence 
is to gain a diversity of ideas, 
concepts and people. Therefore, 
the subsistence of foreign ath- 
letes orUy enhances that expert- 

"IPFW is changmg on a 
daily basis from whal it used to 
be — a Fort Wayne-based cam- 
pus — to a true university," Pope 
added. "The addition of foreign 
students adds a level of diversity 
thai, quite frankly, 1 doubl many 
people with a Fort Wayne base 
are going lo see." 

One might quesUon a for- 
eign student-athletes' decision to 
enroll at a freshly titled Division I 
school with a populahon slightly 
above Ihe 10.000 mark. One 
advantage Ihat IPFW has over 
larger universities is that it offers 
a more personalized, one-on-onc 
approacn. 

"In some 0/ Ihe larger uni- 
versities, you can get lost in the 
shuffle, especially in aihleties 
We try to limit the number of 
student athletes lo 200, so we can 
provide them with a personal- 
ized service," Pope saicf. 

Evident at any level of 
sport, coaches build on Ihc suc- 
cess of the athletic program. 

"Other foreign students ;

ic programs, and they see that as 
a road map of, 'If he can do it. 
then I can as well,'" Pope added. 

Also, according to Jctvell, 
the region is comfortable for for- 
eign student-athletes. 

"Thev have been veiy well 
received through the media, aca- 
demics and jobs," he says, "As 
long as there is a be tu that, they 
are always going to want to give 
back lo this place and help you

here, ll is a win-win situation."

and compete at IPFW

For example, Valparaiso
