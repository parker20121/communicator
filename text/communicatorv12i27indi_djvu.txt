Students elect 16 



Indiana University-Purdue University at Ft. Wayne 



April 23, 1981 



By SANDRA WILEY 
Editor-ln-Chler 

After considering a student's appeal 
to invalidate the April 14-15 Students' 
Government election on grounds it was 
performed, advertised and conceived 
unconstitutionally, Jef( Sandy, Senate 
parliamentarian, declared the elections 
valid and announced the results. 

The balloting resulted in 67 votes for 
each of SG's top candidates, Kenneth A. 
Schenk, Ellen G, Engteman and Clare 
Venus. Schenk is the new SG president, 
Engleman. vice president, and Venus, 
SUBOG chairperson. 

Elected to SG Senate seats are Tom 
Harris. David Timothy Parish, Angela 
Scofield, William B. Allen, Holden 
Maecker, Kent Bowman, Suzy Scare, 
Ron Diehl and Steve Westrick, 

New SUBOG members are Terry J. 
Schuster, Norma Knopp, Greg Hughes 
and Kim Sylvester. 

Within 24 hours after the voting booth 
closed, student Scott A. Kuehn, a for- 
mer senator, appealed the validity of 
the election to parliamentarian Sandy. 

In the four-point appeal, Kuehn 



argued that the election board of the SG 
had failed to post election notices 
conspicuously and failed to include the 
rules of the election — including last 
dates to submit a petition and party 
ticket policy — in its advertising of the 
election. 

In answering point one, Sandy said 
information about the election was 
made sufficiently available, but ad- 
mitted the election board had failed to 
post rules and dales. Sandy said, as a 
matter of precedent, recurrence of 
such failures will invalidate future 
elections. 

Kuehn's second point concerned the 
reserved senate seat designation on the 
ballot for candidate Westrick, Such a 
designation was allowed under SG's old 
constitution. 

Sandy said because of little com- 
petition for senate seats in this election 
— only nine candidates ran for the I8 
senate seats — the reservation of a 
designated seal did not alter the out- 
come of the election since all can- 
didates were put into office. 

Kuehn's third point was that not 
enough candidates were running for the 



offices lo make Ihe elections valid. 

Sandy said although the election did 
not fill enough seats in the Senate or or 
SUBOG, and as a result a special 
election should be called in the near 
future lo fill vacancies, nonetheless the 
present election was valid. 

The fourth point of Kuehn's appeal 
raised Ihe question of whether the 
election was really an election in the 
"true democratic sense of the word" 
Ijecause there had been no opposition to 
candidates. 

Parliamentarian Sandy agreed there 
was no choice in the election, and it was 
a "shame that no greater interest exists 
in deciding who \yill choose how to 
spend the $110,000 of the activity fee 
money (and) protect the students' 
interests with the administration." 

He said, however, that SG cannot 
force people lo run in the election and a 
lack of candidal^ did not detract from 
the validity of the results. 

Summing up, Sandy said because 
Kuehn was not a parlicipanl in the 
election, he could not challenge the 
validity of the election. 



Budgeting delays schedules 




By JAMIE WISE 

Staff Writer 

Printed schedules for the two 1981 

IPFW summer sessions will be 
available al the late date of April 27 
because of uncertainties in state 
budgeting for the next two years, 
Edward A. Nicholson, vice chancellor 
and dean of faculty told The Com- 
municator. 

Indiana and Purdue universities, 
both slate-funded schools, depend on 
the stale for 75 percent of their budget 
monies, said John Carnaghi, vice 
chancellor for financial affairs. 

The slate legislature, now in session, 
is expected to be finished with the 
budget for state agencies in May. Half 



of the summer session's budget will be 
out of this new budget and half of it is 
already scheduled out of certain ap- 
propriations, Nicholson said. 

"We are in the first year of a new 
biennium," Nicholson said. "Next 
year's appropriation has not been 
established, and as things looked bleak, 
as much lime as possible was spent in 
committing those dollars." 

The administrators were uneasy 
about committing the money to the 
summer session because slate 
revenues have gone down, he said, and 
could result in smaller budgets. 
Nicholson blamed the economy and 
unemployment for the lower revenues. 

O. FYankhn Kenworthy, assistant 
vice chancellor and assistant dean to 



faculty, echoed Nicholson's 
remarks, but emphasized the need for 
"funding analysis." 

'"There were some funding decisions 
being made at the summer session, 
generally, which took more time to look 
al than jusl the allocation of funds to 
academic units," Kenworthy said. 

The fall schedule was ready first, he 
explained, so the administration 
decided not lo hold up printing, 

"I'm sure there have been some 
inconveniences to students." he said, 
referring to students who would have 
liked to plan their summer schedule 
early in light of possible jobs or 
vacations. 

Registration for the first summer 
session will be May 14 and 15.

Animal acts entertain small crowd 



By CHERYL GIBSON 
Chief Reporter 

Although the skies were overcast last 
Thursday, Joni Putt's Trained Animal 
Acts pul a shining smile on the faces of 
children who came to watch the show. 

The University Friends of Animals 
sponsored the show during Harbor 
Arbor Days on the Walb Memorial 
Union Plaza. Putt's variety of animals 
entertained a "small" crowd of 
students and faculty on the cold and 
gloomy day. 

Putt is a senior at IPFW and vrill 
graduate this spring with a degree in 



psychology. She has been training 
animals for eight years. During this 
time she has performed for various 
churches, girl scout troops and schools. 

The four-part animal act began with 
Horizon, a four-year-old Appaloosa. But 
Horizon had a mind of her own and did 
not follow her trainer's orders. The 
horse successfully completed a few 
tricks before heading over for the 
grass. 

Peaches, a Ihree-y ear-old St. Ber- 
nard mix, did some very cute tricks. 
The dog prayed, played dead, and made 
a bridgeover two objects. 



A three-year-old sheep named Clover 
performed very well. Clover danced. to 
"Mary Had a Little Lamb," and 
followed Putt around doing many tricks 
similar lo those performed by the dog. 

Calliope, the final acl. was a 
miniature horse almost a year old. The 
highlight of the act came when a New 
Year's Eve hat was put on the horse, 
who then shook a noise maker. She also 
danced lo the song "One Trick Pony." 

The performances overall were quite 
comical. The acts were entertaining to 
the children who weathered the cold 
lempera lure to watch. 



In brief. . • 

Cheating not blatant at IPFW 



By GLORIA HIZER 

Staff Writer 

With final exams fast approaching 

and the pressures of completing 

another semester escalating, will 
the students at IPFW find it 
necessary to resort lo cheating lo 
pass a course? 

"No," said John Ulmer, dean of 
Student Services. "I really don't 
think il is a blatant, flagrant 
situation here and the incidence is 
rathei' insignificant," 

The Academic Handbook defines 
cheating as "dishonestyof any kind 
with respecl to examinations, course 
assignments, alteration of recort^, 
or illegal possession of 
examinalions," Ulmer noted that 
academic dishonesty includes 
plagiarism, the biggest form of 
academic misconduct, as well as 
computer program cheating. 

When academic misconduct does 



occur, due process, as specifically 
outlined in the Handbook, must be 
followed. A penally affecting a 
student's grade in a course may be 
imposed or the student may be 
transferred lo another section of the 
same course. 

In the matter of repeated offenses, 
Ulmer noted several recourses. "I 
can call the student in for a verbal 
reprimand or pul the student on 
administrative probation. Repealed 
violations subject the student to 
suspension or expulsion," Ulmer 
said. 

Ulmer noted that 95 percent of all 
instances of cheating are handled 
between the professor and the 
sludenl. In cases where there is 
some question about the cir- 
cumstances of the incident, the 
matter would be turned over lo the 
department chairman and even- 
tually to the dean's office. 



Carnaghi forecasts fee hike 



Incompletes can be received 



ByKAROLHERBER 
Chief Reporter 

Grades are always important to 
students, but if one can't finish a 
class, all hope is not lost. Incom- 
pletes can t&gt;e given lo students who 
can not, for some legitimate reason, 
finish a class and are passing the 
subject. 

According to Jack Dahl, registrar 
at IPFW, the sludenl and inslruelor 
gel together and talk over what is to 
be done about the Incomplete grade. 
If Ihe instructor agrees that the 
student could not complete the class 
for "some reason outside of Uiat 
class," said Dahl, an incomplete is 
given. 

Indiana students have one 
calendar year from the dale of the 
incomplete lo fulfill the remaining 
requirements of the class, Purdue 
students have until the twelfth week 



of the second subsequent semester 
of enrollment fallowing the class. 

If at those times, the student has 
not completed the course, the in- 
struclor will assign an F to his or her 
record. If the instructor, however, 
neglects lo do so, said Dahl, the 
Registrar's Office makes a periodic 
computer check-up on all grades and 
will assign the failing grade at that 
lime. 

Should the student choose to 
repeat the course after this time, the 
failing grade will still count, along 
with the grade he or she will receive 
from this sameclass 

While the incomplete does count 
and will show up on the record, it 
will not be figured in the student's 
GPA (grade point average) unless 
he or she eventually fails lo correct 
the grade. 



Outgoing senate OK^s budget 



By JIM CHAPMAN 
Chief Rep orler 

Budgets, n subscription to an 
educational magazine, and left- 
handed desks were Uie topics when 
the out-going administration of the 
Student Senate me t in its last session 
April 13, 

The Senate passed the proposed 
budget for the allocation of student 
activity fees for the 1982-83 
academic year al IPFW. Paris of 
the proposed budget were slightly 
changed, but Ihe original draft 
mainly stayed Ihesame, 

The Senate extended lis mem- 
bership in the American Student 
Associations, 
Also, $32,50 was allocated from 



the Students' Government Office 
Account for a subscription to the 
Chronical of Higher Education, 
According lo the Senate, the 
publication will help Uie Legislative 
Affairs Committee stay informed 
about the status of legislation 
dealing with colleges around the 
nation. 

The Senate will be looking into the 
possibility of resolving to push for 
left-handed desks. The Senate would 
like left-handed desks in every 
classroom of every building on the 
IPFW campus. The Senale also 
talked about Ihe possibility of having 
commercial bank machines in- 
stalled on campus for the use of 
students. 



BySANDRAmLEY 
Edilor-ln-Chief 

A fee hike (or students of at least 12 
percent was forecast by John R. 
Carnaghi, vice chancellor for financial 
affairs, during the spring faculty 
convocation April 16, 

Carnaghi said although the exact 
amount of fee increases will not be 
known until the General Assembly 
approves its 1981-83 higher education 
budget, students can expect "dramatic 
increases m tuition and fees ,.. not 
under 12 percent." 

Carnaghi said "hefty increases for 
out-of-state students" are also ex- 
pected. 

State legislators also hold the fate of 
salary increases for faculty, said 
Chancellor Joseph P, GiusU at the 
convocation. He said the House and 
Senate versions of the higher 
education budget now call tor a 3,7 
percent increase for IPFW faculty 
salaries. 

While 3.7 percent is more than 
percent recommended earlier by the 
State Budget Committee, it is less than 
Ihe 13.6 percent requested. 

Summing up the uncertainty over 
the higher education budget, Chan- 



cellor Giusli said "I do have faith" the 
■"late le^slalors will do the best they 
can in IPFW's behalf. 

The budget is being discussed in a 
House-Senate conference commi ttee. 

The Chancellor, with tongue in 
cheek, said although Caster would end 
the Lenten season for some. Lent 
would not end until the completion of 
the budget, "It will be a two-week 
period of prayer" for the IPFW faculty 
and administration, he said. 

The 1981 legislative session will end 
April 30. 

Chancellor Giusti said compensation 
for faculty was the top priority in 
working within any new budget. He 
said increased enrollment makes it 
imperative to have more faculty and 
retain the present faculty. 

Also, administrators would like to 
reduce the ratio of associate faculty to 
permanent faculty, Ctiancellor Giusti 
said. He said the current associate 
faculty ratio is hi^. 

In other areas, the Chancellor said 
the newly-approved four-year 
engineering degree program will cost 
$250,000 lo implement. The target date 
for beginning the degree program is 
fall 1982. 

Edward R. Nicholson, also speaking 



at the convocation, said the Depart- 
ment of Genera! andTechnieal Studies 
(DGTS) will be int^raled into other 
academic units, with the integration 
completed by falll982. 

Nicholson, the academic vice 
chancellor, said, however, the 
dowTitown DGTS facilities will not he 
abandoned. He said it's in the planning 
stages to move the Department of 
Continuing Education to that site. That 
department, he said, "probably ought 
to be more involved in what's hap- 
pening downtown and the 
redevelopment taking place there." 

Continuing educati'on, Nicholson 
said, should be financially self- 
supporting by next year, and within 
three to five years contribute dollars lo 
the university's general fund. 

The projected opening dates of 
IPFW's Building D and the HPER 
Building were announced by Carnaghi. 
He said Building D will be ready Nov. 
15 and the HPER building by Aug, 31 . 

Faculty members will be allowed to 
move into the new offices in building D 
as each fioor t)ecomes available for 
occupancy, Carnaghi said. The third 
fioor should be ready in early June, 
second floor by June 15, Isl floor by 
early July, and the ground fioor in 



early August, he said. 

The physical plant personnel will 
organize the move lo the new 

buildings. 

In phase two of the moving process, 
vacated offices in Neff and Kettler 
halls will be renovated and freed up for 
other use. The extent of the renovation 
will be determined by the amount of 
funds received for the project. 

John Ulmer, dean of student ser- 
vices, said Ihe raise in the student 
activity fee proposal is now enroute to 
West Lafayette for final approval. 
During Ihe convocation, Ulmer 
praised the efforts of students who 
worked to get approval of the 
engineering degree and who lobbied 
the legislature to hold tuition fee in- 
creases to 8 percent. 

Reporting on the statiis of WIPU- 
FM, Jerry Medley, director of 
University Relations and Develop- 
ment, said although the campus public 
radio station had some problem areas 
— space and budgeting for instance — 
Ihe station is doing well. He. said 
George Wendl, WIPU station 
manager, is working hard in the areas 
of development and underwriting and 
is getting results. 



Gambler earns illesal livins throush sambling 

RvRnRFRTRIMPAn«nu ^^ ^^ O ^ O 



One look at Joe and you mi^t 
assume he's a success in life. His wife is 
a teacher in the Fort Wayne Public 
School system. He has two healUiy 
children, a fashionable house and a nice 
car. Plus, his income for 1380 exceeded 
$27,000. But how Joe earns his money is 
illegal according to Indiana law. For 
Joe b a professional gambler. 

Over the past 12 years his earnings 
have some exclusively from gambling, 
Chicago, Atlanta, New York, Miami. 
and Fort Wayne are bul a few of the 
cities in which he's gambled. 

Joe considers himself a working 
gambler although he readily admits he 
doesn't particularly like to gamble, 
"Ironically, ifshowImakemyUving," 
he says. 

Joe firs! spoke with me at a local bar 
on Harrison SI. He described at some 
length how he makes his connections to 
gel into games. 

"I'll spend S200-$300 a week buying 
people drinks, food, and entertainment. 
It's an investment the way I see it. Then 
if everything works out, I'llbeinacard 
game. " Joe also said that be gives those 
who acted as liasons a percentage of his 
wimings. 
But what happens when he loses? 
"Simple. I never lose." he stated, 
"And why not? Because I cheat, I never 
gamble at anything unless I cheat," Not 
only has Joe learned lo cheat al cards, 
tml also dice games including back- 
gammon, and even dominos. 

Joe's life has been one of ups and 
downs. He has already speni almost 
two years of his life in prison. Sources 
within the Fori Wayne Police Dcparl- 



ment said the next time Joe was 
convicted, he would he sentenced as a 
habitual criminal. That would mean 
Joe would face 30 years in confinement. 
Bul he has gone lo some length to 
educate himself about the system 
which brands his activities as criminal. 
A few years ago he look a case law class 
at IPFW. II so happened the instructor 
of the class was an assistant prosecutor 
who'd had previous run-ins with Joe in 
court. 

Joe has even gone so far as to plead 
his own case. An added incentive to 
cause Joe concern is the fact tiial Joe's 
former partner was sentenced for lour 
years confinement at Uie Westville 
Correctional Center for professional 
gambling. 

The second of our interviews was 
conducted al an apartment Joe rented. 
He explained its purpose was lo act as a 
cover. He did not want his wife and 
children exposed lo the harsh 
possibility of the police coming in the 
middle of the night to arrest. As added 
protection, his wife used her maiden 
name. 

extend into the late morning, he oflen 
spends the daytime sleeping Before the 
interview began, he removed a 5-shol 
derringer from the pocket of his robe 
and returned it lo the bedroom. He 
stressed the point thai Ihe gun was only 
kept as a means of protection from the 
unexpected. 

In the apartment itself, many of the 
furnishings were artifacts he'd won 
from previous games, "A lot of Ihe time 
people just don't have Ihe cash, so I end 
up accepting merchandise instead. 
Hell, I've got a whole drawer full of 
watchesandrings,"hesaid. 



Joe then explained some of Ihe 
methods he used lo cheat, "Any board 
games, either the crap tables, the pool 
tables, or even the backgammon 
boards, you use a technique called 
juicing. That's using a system of 
placing electrified metal plates or 
wires in or near the boards. In turn ihe 
dice are magnilized. Then an overseer 
of the table or the player has a switch 
hidden in his pocket and presses il when 
he wants a uinning combination, " 

Suddenly Joe t&gt;egan lo laugh. "Hell, I 
remember this guy who juiced a golf 
course. Now you tell me that's not going 
lo improve your putting." 
And what about the card games? 
On an afternoon before a card game, 
Joe might have a friend or a partner go 
to a 7-11 slore and purchase all the card 
decks they had on hand. Unseen by Uie 
clerk, Ihe good decks would be replaced 
by marked decks. That evening Joe 
would come lo Ihe store with whoever 
he was going lo play cards against. 
With an air of innocence. Joe would 
allow his unsuspecting opponent to buy 
Ihe cards. That way the opponent would 
feel safe thinking he'd avoided Ihe 
possibility of playing with a marked 
deck. Meanwhile Joe would chuckle, 
assured of another winning evening. 

"You like to play five card stud?" Joe 
asked suddenly. I nodded that 1 did. He 
then reached into his pocket for a deck 
of cards He promised that it wasn't a 
marked deck 

Dealing oui five cards lo both of us, I 
looked al my hand and saw three kings 
along with two minor cards. Keeping 
the kings, I asked for two cards. 
Expressionless, Joe took only one 1 
figured Ihe odds were agamst him 



scoring on either a flush or a straight. 

When 1 picked up my two cards, 
much lo my surprise I'd found he'd 
given me another king, 

"Well, what have you got?" Joe 
asked, 1 laid down the four kings con- 
fidently Bul I was quickly dismayed 
when he laid down four aces. 

He pointed out the average card 
player's allention was always turned lo 
Ihe cards as they were laid instead of 
the dealers hands. Unnoticed he would 
turn the deck over and push out the next 
card with Ws Mltle finger, enabling him 
lo see what il was. il was Uien his dec- 
ision lo give his opponent the card on 
lop or else deal one from beneath the 
deck. 

Bul il is his abihty lo lease the op- 
ponent to get him lo bet more that 
makes Ihe game worth his while, Joe 

Responding lo critics who fell thai 
organized crime would become in- 
volved if gambling became legal in 
Indiana, Joe's opinion wa? tJ. ..'nl 

"I'venevr ' .'o involved many KJid 
of game where anyone introduced 
himself or was introduced as a mem tier 
of the mafia." he said. Joe then scoffed 
when confronted about an article m Ihe 
New York Times which claimed Ihe 
Michigan Lottery was barely out of the 
inFanI stage when it l&gt;ecame involved in 
a struggle between the underuorld and 
the federal government over how the 
profits were lo be divided, 

"It's just a paranoia Ihe critics feel," 
Joe said. 

He also felt if gambling was 

legalized, Ihe Stale of Indiana stood lo 

prosper He pointed out the amount of

pG vs. apathy 




•.The Sludents' GovemmenI elections are 
ayer, but (or members ot (hal body, the job 
^s jusl begun. The biggesl task facing the 
flew administration of SG is Ihal of liiming 
1^ tide of apathy on this campus 
;5A'e call il apathy when $7 voles elects (he 
t^BwSG president, vice president and SUBOG 
cttairperson— just G7 of more than 10,000 
oicdil hour IPFW students. 

yhc apathy didn't begin with the eleclions, 
bill we hope apathy can be ended after the 
eleclion. 

,?i's hard to believe students don't care how 
Suspends the SMO,000 collected each year in

; It's also hard lo believe students don't care 

:\vho represents their interests before the 

^administration. 

■, We'd like to believe students here are not 



apathetic, simply uninformed about the 
important roles SG plays. Erasing the 
misconception slufienls have that SG is 
unimportant could help end theapathy. 

To enlighten students, perhaps the mem- 
bers of SG should begin a new campaign— a 
campaign to make SG more visable on 
campus. 

SG is becoming a viable force behind many 
worthwhile campus projects; il can become a 
vital force in campus planning and activities. 

The foundation— new members who seem 
to want lo accomplish much with students' 
government— is there. 

It's now up tolhenew leadership ofSG, Ken 
Schenk, Ellen Engleman and Clare Venus, to 
build upon this foundation. 

It's time to build a SG void of apathy.

iTo Ihe Editor:

^Syracuse Chapter of our

is no exception. We concede 



that the article concerning 
our Syracuse Chapter deals 
only with the facts, but we 
feel obhgated to make 
record of our displeasure at 
its inclusion in Tlie Com- 
municator. Our fraternity 
has been involved in many 
worthwhile community 
projects— these have gone 
undocumented. We have 
worked for the American 
Heart Fund and look an 
active role in ihe recent 
muscular dystrophy

gone unnoted as we are 
concerned thai this negative

does the Syracuse Chapter

Gambling 

1 Continued from pace 1 1 
money leaving the state by 
"pie citizens playing the other 
plates lolleries, or going to 
y^s Vegas, or Atlantic Cily 
'{oiild be taxed. 
!• "Hell I'm tired of being 
-illegal I'd hke to quit looking 
^ver my shoulder and slart 
living wilh my family. I just 
;^ant lo be an ordinary guy," 
^e said. Joe noted people 
^■ere always going to want 
the victimless crimes. Along 
Vilh gambling, he included 
prostitution. He then quoted 
^ Caponc; '"Tm only 
Jiro\1dine a oublic service.'" . , 



But what about Ihe person 
who couldn't resist the 
temptation to gamble or the 
amount of money he or she 
lost? "I want lo tell you 
something," he argued, 
"God ain't even gonna stop 
the sickles from gambling. 
Just likeyouain'l gonna stop 
an alcho from taking a drink, 
or a junkie from shooting 
dope in his arm." 

What did bother him. was 
how he felt so much police 
time was wasted on gam- 
bling raids. He felt that in- 
stead of wasting their time 
busting some for what a 
majority did. the police 
should instead be arresting 
burglars and rapists 



"Old people gamble, 
young people gamble, the 
churches sponsor bingo 
games, and the schools raise 
money with smokers," he 
added further, 'i lost S7,000 
last year on the stock 
market. Now, in theory, you 
tell me the difference be- 
tween Ihe stock market and 
acrapgame?" 

Joe then readily admitted 
his earnings could probably 
triple if Indiana- were to 
legalize gambling. "Bui at 
least ihey would make a 
buck off me " 

Wrapping up the in- 
terview, I headed towards 
(he door but slopped short. I 
turned and wished him luck. 



ByBOBBIKRElCKER 

Having spent much time 
evaluating ^Vhere I've Been 
and Where 1 Want To Go, 
Who I Am and Who I Want To 
Be, I've created countless 
checklists and plotted 
perpelual plans toward 
"self-improvement" 
(substitule "perfection" i 
The lists, lo name a few, 
bear idealistic headings: 
"Important Values To Live 
By," "lAm-I WantToBe." 
"Maximizing The Joy- 
Minimizing The Pain," "My 
Someday List." "Never 
Again!" and "Staying On 
The Cope Slope. " These have 
served as navigational aids 
on the Road To Becoming. 
They have been catalysts for 
change — they have also 
harassed, hassled, and 
hurried me through Ihe days 
and years of my life! 

Growth IS a perpelual 
process and change can be 
painful. Still. personal 
growth IS a tremendously 
rewarding and exiiilarating 
experience. For me, it is the 
meaning of Life itself. 
However, I suspect that 
growth and change are 
inevitable — it you're alive, 
you cannot avoid growth, 
change, or pain. 

So who needs to push the 
process of Becoming? Who 
needs the hassle of trying to 
"measure up" — only lo 
extend the measuring rod? 
Most goal-setters cannot 
resist setting a new goal as 
soon as an old one is within 
sight. Thus, goal-setting 
becomes an obsession and 



self-measurement, a com- 
pulsion. 

Taking stock of oneself is 
not all bad, but il can be 
overdone If. as the Small 
Business Administration 
advises, a new. business 
cannot assess its potential in 
less Ihan a year, why expect 
an individual lo do so? 1 
think one should adopi the 
corporate plan and have a 
"stockholders meeting" 

once a year. As I see it, an 
annua! review is sufficient 
for progress; anything more 
amounts to a kind of per- 
fecbonist per^'ersion! It is, 
however, necessary lo have 
some goals and ideas of 
where you're going or, as the 
title of a popular book 
suggests, you're likely lo end 
up Somewhere Else. 

But pushing progress, 
focusing on Becoming in- 
stead of on Being, demands a 
Yes lerday -Tomorrow 
orienlation While one is 
evaluating Ihe Past in order 
to plan for Ihe Future, Today 
is being lost. The Here-and- 
Now of Toda)' IS the only 
reality; the past is memory 
and Ihe future, dreams. 

In "Notes to Myself." 
Hugh Prather expresses this 
GesLallbeaulifully: 

"I cannot 'make my mark' 
for all time . . Nothing will 
even mean tomorrow what it 
did today- Meaning changes 
with context. My 

meaningfulness is here. II is 
enough that I am of X'alue lo 
someone today. It is enough 
that I make a difference

Surr Writer 

Minority Democrats in the 
state legislature are 
claiming foul play in the 
Republican haniUing of 
reapportionment of the 
General Assembly and the 
Congressional districts. 

'■We all must understand 
that action taken in this 
session of the l^islatureon 
apportioning the General 
Assembly and the 
Congressional districts will 
have impact on all of us for 
the next decade." Stale 
Senator Wayne Townsend 
(D-Hartford City) said 
earlier last month. 

"We do not understand 
why the Republican party 
does not wish to join with is 
in the Democratic party and 
encourage active citizen 
participation," Townsend 
said. 

Townsend and other 
Democrats are upset with 
Republicans for using a 
computer "behind closed 
doors" In the Republican 
Stale Central Committee 
office to help them make up 
maps for redistricting. 

Townsend accused 
Republicans of "gerry- 
mandering" apportioning 
districts to favor 

Republicans. 

"Reapportionment is a 
political act, but we 
(Republicans) will be fair," 
said James Ritchie, staff 
aide lo chief Republican on 
the Reapportionment 
Committee. 

Area Republican 

representative Phyllis Pond 
said that gerrymandering is 
used by bw)lh parties. "It's an 
old pohtical game," Pond 



said. She believes that the 
conclusions made in the 
legislature will be as fair as 
possible. 

Ritchie said that the 
Republicans are only 
drawing up preliminary 
maps in the Central Com- 
mittee office, "Because of 
pending suits Tiled by the 
cities of Detroit and Cin- 
cinnati against the Census 
Bureau, the Census Bureau 
has not released its final 
results," he said, "We 
cannot take action until this 
information is in," 

Ritchie did say that all 
decisions made concerning 
reapporiionment will be 
made in public. ■ "Nothing 
will be done bdiind anyone's 
back, "he said. 

Democrats are angry that 
Republicans are not ^ving 
them access to the computer 
being used by Republicans. 

"They say they are for 
openness and fairness, yet 
apparently they have 
committed in excess of a 
quarter of a million dollars 
for (the) computer," 
Townsend said. "It would be 
much more sensible it the 
capabilities of a computer 
are found desirable, that it 
be used in the openness of the 
legislative system- 
available to both Democrats 
and Republicans." he said. 

Ritchie said Democrats 
will not have access to the 
computer. "The state 
Republican treasury is 
paying for the computer. The 
results will be examined in 
open committee,'" Ritchie 
said, 

Indiana stands lo lose one 
seat in the U.S House, 
leaving the state with 



twelve. 

According lo Democrat 
Senate Caucus spokesperson 
Marci Reddick, Democrats 
wish to keep counties and 
townships intact when 
redistricting.

Penny Carnival a hit 



Bugs Bunny &amp; Co. 
delight youngsters 



By DARYL S.BRANDT 
Copy Editor 

Raggedy Ann waited Tor 
the Easier Bunny while 
Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny 
had it out in the other room. 
Paper sacks full of treats 
and prizes sal untouched on 
gaining tables and the 
Pocket Lady shifted 
restlessly from one fool to 
the other. 

Something was missing 
from the carnival at- 
mcsphere — kids. 

But shortly after noon the 
kids flooded into Room Z24 of 
the Walb Memorial Unioa 
Dragging their parents with 
them, (bey were anxious to 
try their hands at the Harbor 
Arbor Days Penny Carnival 
held Saturday. April 18. The 
carnival and an Easier Egg 
Hunt were sponsored by 
SUBQG and the Delta 
Gamma Sorority, 

While it was hard to make 
a head count with all the 
scrambling and wriggling. 
around 30 to 40 children 
showed up, ranging in age 
from 15 months to 13 &gt;'ears 
old. 

Hoping to win prizes. I bey 
threw hoops, bean bags and 
ping pong baUs, they fisbed 
tor ducks, and Ihey walked 
the cake walk. They were 
givHi bags in which to slash 
their loot end the sacks were 
soon hanging from their 
shorl arms and dragging on 
the floor. 

"See." said Tyler, age six, 



"a whole bag!" 

His gains ranpL-d from 
penny candy lo B lit lie chalk- 
board. Modeling clay and an 
Avon poodle pin were seen in 
the hands ot other delighted 
youngsters. 

Lisa Butler, a Delta 
Gamma member, dressed 
up as Raggedy Ann and 
helped hand out prizes. One 
little girl. Sarah, picked out a 
rubber cigar, 

"Aw. you don't wont that,' 
someone said, 

Butler helped the three- 
year-old settle for a toy boal. 

E very one got a prize, even 
if they had to pick someone's 
pocket— hopefully only the 
Pocket Lady's, Sponsored by 
the University Women's 
Club, the Pocket Lady 
donned a skirt covered with 
pockets, each one bulging 
uith prizes. All a child had to 
do was give up a ticket and 
reach in. It was practically a 
give-away. 

And so was the whole 
carnival. Sacks, balloons, 
popcorn and punch were 
free Tickets for the games 
were a dime, hut everyone 
got a prize — sometimes 
even without a ticket 

"We don't try to make a 
profit," said Ann Momper, 
who along with Kathy Ertel, 
Terry Schuster, Clare 
Venus, Ray Konger, and 
others helped run the show. 

Cartoons were shown for 
free in an adjoining room, A 
large crowd of kids and 



adults gathered there to 
watch Bugs Bunny until the 
Easter Bunny showed up, 

Noni Miller, also of Delia 
Gamma, wore the rabbil 
costume and handed out 
Easter eggs. "It's hot inhere 
and I can't hear," she 
confided to Raggedy Ann. 

"There's someone inside 
her," said a little girl who 
had overheard. She shyly 
looka step backward. 

"You never know whether 
they're going to like them or 
cry," said Ertel about the 
children and the Easier 
Bunny costume 

Erica and Andrew, both 
age two, cried. They didn't 
want anything to do with the 
overgrown ca r toon-come- lo- 
life 

But the other kids did, at 
least until the Egg Hunt was 
announced. Then the kids 
poured out into Ihe hallway 
looking for treats lo add to 
their sacks One little boy 
found an egg on a windowsill, 
picked it up, and put an egg 
he had already gotten from 
the Easter Bunny in its 
place. 

Most of the kids enjoyed 
the carnival because of all 
the prizes and treats they 
accumulated, Sixteen- 
month-old Branden didn't 
seem to care if he won a 
priie or not- He gol a big 
thrill out of just leanmg over 
and picking rubber ducks out 
of the duck pond. 




Rhythmic Union, an ensemble of five musicians pinning 5(^0 instruments, won three 
standing ovations from the large crowd attending its concert last Saturday durUig Harbor

League pre§ent8 ^theatre of the mind'' 



Woody interpreted 



By NANCY SUCK 
Staff Writer 

When Janet Roncelli 
called Woody Allen's agent 
about using some of Allen's 
stories in a theatrical 
production, he firmly op- 
posed the idea and denied 
permission. 

The production in question 
is "A Woody Allen Quartet," 
which includes "Counl 
Dracula." "Notes from the 
Overfed," "Death Knocks," 
and "The Whore of Mensa." 
Roncelh, assistant professor 



Film recreates Dark Ages 



By MIKE GEFFEN 

Chief Reporter 

To put it simply and 

succinctly, "Excalibur" is 
the most magical and 
majestical film of the year. 
Writer-director John 
Boorman had a hurculean 
task — lo teU the whole 
Arthurian legend in one film 
and in 140 minutes He ac- 
comphshes the feat with a 
remarkable deftness and 
grace that other directors 
would envy 

In a recent American Film 
article on the film, Boorman 
stated that "...what we see in 
Ihe story is the horror and ' 
dissension of man, and his 
warring, fueding and 
brutality — his inability to 
reaUy attain his higher aims 
and ideals But I thmk the 
moving thing about it is the 
attempts that people make to 
tr&gt;' to reach those things In a 
sense, that's what redeems 
the characters — their 
aspirations. not their 
deeds." 

This theme of the quest, of 
man striving to prove 
himself, is a theme un- 
derlying all of Boorman's 
films Whether it is Lee 
Marvin tryuig lo find the 
truth in the murder mystery 
'Point Blank," or Burt 
Reynolds and company 
trying to conquer a Georgia 



river in "Deh vera nee," the 
quest is in many ways 
similar lo the quest in 
"Excalibur" — the search 
for some sort of order in the 
world. 

In fad, Boorman's ob- 
session with the quesl theme 
is what led him to make 
"Excalibur" Making a film 
about the Arthurian legend 
has been a dream project of 
his for over len years. He got 
interested in the legend by 
reading T S, Eliot's "The 
Waste Land, " and went onto 
read all the books he could 
find on the legend. 

The impact the poetry had 
on him is evident in the 
film's many panoramic 
shots of Knights jousting, 
clashing knighls waging 
war, and plush green land- 
scapes that seem other- 
worldly These shots create 
an awe-inspiring wonder 
that is somewhat similar to 
the emotion raised in Ihe 
island sequence in "The 
Black StaUion," 

Much of the film's wonder 
can be attributed to Alex 
Thomson's exquisite 
cinematography. To make 
all that armour shine without 
any animated special effects 
must have been a ni^tmare 
for him. especially when one 
considers all the separate 
lifting sources needed for 



the task, but his efforts have 
given the film a natural tone 
it otherwise wouldn't" have 
had. Thomson's spectacular 
work is most evident in the 
glowing shots of Excalibur, 
and in the film's most 
stunning shot, the wedding of 
King Arthur lo Guinevere 
Thomson definitely deserves 
a nomination next year at 
Oscar time. 

Another amazing thing 
about the film is the exacting 
way Boorman has recreated 
the world of King Arthur. 
The brutality and sensuality 
of the Dark Ages are 
depicted more reahstically, 
if somewhat stylized, than in 
any other film on the subject. 
He graphically shows the 
barbarism of the time 
through ski lit ul crosscut ting 
during some of the battle 
sequences and the stark 
nature of the film's violence 
and sex scenes. 

The unsettling lone of 
these scenes conveys 
Boorman's nation that in 
those times the world was in 
a transition. A world where 
an old pagan order was 
dying, giving way to an age 
of reason and the 
enlightenment of 

Christianity It was also a 
world where legend was 
slowly becoming myth. Since 
he is interested in depicting 



these aspecis of this world 
and in trying to show the 
dull-witted nature of man in 
this period, Boorman is not 
really concerned wilh 
character development. The 
acting seems lackluster as a 

The most compelling 
performance comes from 
Nicol Williamson, who as 
Merlin, represents one of the 
guiding forces ot this world. 
In many ways. Merlin is the 
most crucial character of the 
film and has the most 
complex personality. Merlin 
is a combination of ribald 
jokester. omnipotent wizard, 
and frightened man. Merlin 
changes emotions with the 
facility of a chameleon 
changing colors. The role 
provides a marvelous 
showcase for Williamson, 
who gives Merlin a charged 
nervous energy that shows 
the power of his character, 

"Excalibur" is first in 
what promises lo be a long 
line of sword and sorcery 
films lo be released this 
year. It is a magnificent film 
that sets a high standard for 
the others to follow and will 
probably become a classic of 
the genre. It is one of those 
rare films that ignites the 
imagination and fires the 
soul. John Boorman's len 
year gamble has finally paid 
off.

Because of this, Allen's

Vannelli rocks 
in new album 



By STEVE I'ONLEY 
"Nightwalker" is Gino 
Vannelli's first album after a 
two-and-a-half year hiatus 
since his last release in 
October of 1978, "Brolher lo 
Brother" Fans of this 
unique vocalist should be 
dancing in Ihe streets by 
now, 

Vannelli has moved to 
j\i*isla Records after a long 
relationship (6 albums) with 
Herb Alport's A &amp; . M 
Records, Ihe move reputedly 
prompted by his dis- 
satisfaction with com- 
mercial pressures from 

■Nightwalker" is a block- 
Luster and will undoubtedly 
draw more of the uninitiated 
lo this magnetic performer, 
tvilh the added benefit of 
possibly winning back 
longtime followers who may 
have been dismayed with the 
direction he has pursued Ihe 
last couple of years. 

This Canadian singer- 
songwriter had moved closer 
lo the pop mainstream with 
shorter song lengths and 
simpler harmonic 

progressions of late, as 
exhibited by disco ditties in 
the formidable Bee Gee vein. 

On "Nightwalker," 
Vannelli has demonstrated 
his penchant for exploring 
and developing new musical 
formats. The trademark lush 
orches I rations and superb 
vocals are, of course, 
prominent and first-rate. But 
Ihe evolution of his 
songwriting and brother 
Joe's arrangement have 
reached a new plateau, 
making the album the qualit- 
ative followup to I976's "Gist 
of the Gemini." 

Heavier lyrical content 
has returned with emphasis 
on subject heretofore not 



dealt with or fully examined, 
i,e. Vannelli's unrequited 
love, loneliness, and op- 
timism. This is not lo Boy 
that Vannelli has abandoned 
the Macho-Man formula he 
has so skillfully exploited. 
"Stay With Me" is another in 
the series of "Love Me 
Now," "Love is a Night" 
genre. Some might find his 
overt sexuality and 
suggestive lyrics un- 
necessary or hedonjstically 
alluring. Unquestionably, it 
is a major part of his Image 
and it sells records. 

The constantly changing 
Vannelli band centers 
around Gino and his brothers 
Joe and Ross, Joe is the main 
arranger-keyboardist and 
band leader in concert 
sellings, while Ross co- 
writes and sings with Gino 
during the recording process 
and nms the soundboard on 
tours. 

Don't hold your breath for 
Vannelli lo come to Fort 
Wayne ( though it would be a 
pleasant surprise) as the 
band usually tours only the 
major-arena circuit. 

The choice cuts on 
"Nightwalker" are the title 
cut, which is a primo opener, 
"Put the Weight on My 
Shoulders" and the gospel- 
tinged "I Believe," "Santa 
Rosa" is an infectious rocker 
reflecting Vannelh's passion 
for California. Radio stations 
like WXKE and Detroit's 
CKLW are playing "Living 
Inside Myself," so expect 
that on Fort Wayne's Top 40 
stations in eon or so. 
Whether or not you are 
familiar with Vannelli, I'm 
certain that those with ears 
will find "Nightwalker" 
worth a listen or two. That's 
all it takes to get hookedl I

Coucar release does matter 



Nothin^ Matters^ pure rock 



By TIM SMITH 
Staff Writer 

That whiz kid from 
Bloomington has done it 
again. With two successful 
singles from his latest LP, 
Johnny Cougar has visibly 
established himself a seat in 
the ball of commercially 
successful rock n' rollers. 

The new album, entitled 
■•Nothin' Matters and What 
If It Did." shows, much to 
many previous Cougar 
critics' chagrin, that 
although Bruce Springsteen 
may be John's principle 
influence, he is nowhere near 
the Springsteen clone he has 
been falsely labeled in the 
past. 

Given the fact that it is 
almost impossible to rate an 
artist's worth without 
comparing his work to that 
of his predecessors, one finds 
not only the influence of 
Springsteen but also that of 
others such as Tom Petty 
and Elvin Bishop — Bishop's 
influence is particularly 
heard in Cougar's hit single 
"This Time." 

Springsteen. Bishop and 
Petty sound like rather 



strange tiedfellows, do they 
not? Well, there is one very 
important thing these three 
and Cougar have in com- 
mon: a complete un- 
derstanding of the principles 
of good ole' grass roots rock 
n' roll. 

It's very refreshing to hear 
rock n' roll that is pure and 
unadulterated by studio 
effects and a menagerie of 
pedals and synthesizers that 
have a tendency to turn 
basically good tunes into 
electronic slop. 

Although the bulk of the 
credit for this purity is due to 
Cougar's writing abilily, 
producer Steve Cropper 
must certainly not be 
overlooked. Cropper, of 
Blues Brothers fame, has 
been in the business for a 
long time in the capacity of 
both musician and producer. 
His prowess at recognizing a 
musician of Cougar's 
potential and then molding 
him into a success is 
unquestionable. It is 
Cropper's simple and 
straightforward production 
techniques that give 
"Nothin' Matters and What 



If It Did" the powerful, 
punchy sound it needed to 
lake it from good into the 
realm of excellent. 

John Cougar, if his latest 
album is any pretense of 
things lo come, is a man to 
keep an eye on in the future. 
He's come a long way since 
bis fledgling days as one of 
the regular shows at 
Bloominglon's Bluebird, 
luiviiig recently hacked the 
V.htirUi' D.iiiicis H:iik1 ,i( IIic 



Coliseum. Rumor has it that 
he will be appearing at this 
year's Little 500 festivities, 
which just goes to show that 
he hasn't forgotten his roots 
in the wake of fame and 
fortune. 

John Cougar's "Nothin' 
Matters and What if It Did" 
— it's well worth the money 
lo hear an Indiana boy who 
holds his own with, and turns 
the heads of, the best of 'em.

The iransplanLolion of

losome, nevertheless occurs 
and is a much needed service 
for those patients who might 
otherwise die without a 
donor's organ.

Transplant Coordinator oF

One hundred transplants

Lewandowsky of Fort Wayne 



Ncphrolog 

specializes in the study of the 
kidney, deals only with those 
patients who have diseases 
of the organ and who may be 
on a kidney machine. 

Initially, said Lewan- 
dowsl^, the possible donor, 
who is a living relalive of the 
patient, travels to 

Indianapolis for blood tests 
and tissue typing to see if he- 
she is compatible with the 
patient. Approved donors see 
a physician for a complete 
physical, including more 
extensive blood and urine 
tests, along with X-raj'S and 
further testing of the kidno's 



to insure that they have two 
healthy functioning organs. 
Once all requirements arc 
met, the transplant occurs in 
Indianapolis. 

In the event a patient is 
brought into a hospital 
severely injured, the person 
might become a donor Uthe 
patient has suffered from 
brain death, where two flat 
EEC's leiectroen- 

cephalograms) have been 
registered, and no other part 
of the body has been injured, 
donation would be plausible, 
said Sharon Heslet. RN and 
Head Nurse of Lutheran 
Hospital's Intensive Care 
Unit in Fort Wayne. 

A typical case where a 
donation might occur, she 
said, might be a 2e-year-old 
male, severely injured in an 
auto accident with massive 
head trauma and a cerebral 
hemorrhage. 

The hospital would "do 
everything humanly and 
medically possible to keep 
the patient alive." she said, 
but in the event that no brain 
waves were registered, 
taken twice in a 12-24 hour 
period, the physician would 
be notified. 

From then, the chaplain 



mighl approach the patient's 
family to see if they would 
consider the donation. 
However, al no time does the 
family have to concede to it. 
even if the patient has a 
donor card or has voiced the 
wish to become a donor. 

If the family does consent, 
the organ is removed in the 
hospital and kept cool to slow 
doHTi cellular metabolism 
and prevent the cells from 
dying, said Heslet. The state 
police transport the organs 
to Indianapolis where tissue 
typing and cross-matching is 
done Computers are used to 
find the most compatible 
donor, tiecause "they want 
the best possible match 
I they can get i ." she said. 

According to Heslet. 
anyone from three to 55 
years old can be a donor, if 
they have two healthy kid- 
neys and do not have, among 
other medical problems, 
high blood pressure, 
diabetes and certain types of 
malignancies, 

"Donating kidneys gives 
Ihe bereaved family a look at 
what good can come out of 
the death. Two other people 
are given the chance to try 
and sustain a better life," 
she said.

Nadonley said. 

In other areas, an ap- 
plicant is judged on on-slage

Miss Fort Wayne, judges will 
select four runner-up con- 
testants who will also 
receive scholarship money. 



The pageant will be July IB

'The workshop is designed 
as advice for the con- 
testants," Nadonley said. 
"We want to give everyone 
the best possible chance of

Women's track team

four new records 



By TIMOTHY J. ROSS 
Sports Edllor 

Tlie women's track learn 
seems lo be saying thai 
aoyone can break records, 
and they are prodng it. After 
breaking six IPFW school 
records in their Dr^t meet 
the women turned around 
and broke lhre« or their new 
records along with another 
one. 

Apparently Jill Thiele was 
not satisfied with her new 
records in the ISOO and the

could wQii no longer than the

Tuskers gain confidence 



By MIKE FRANKE 
Chlel Reporter 

Tlie IPFW baseball team 
had a ver&gt;' busy schedule 
last week as II played 
three doubleheaders in three 
days, 

(Jn Thursday the squad 
played Goshen in a pair that 
resulted in the Tuskers 
winning the first game, 3-2. 
and losuig the nightcap, 8-3. 

The previous weekend saw 
the Tuskers lose two 
doubleheeaders to the 
weather Last Friday they 
made up one of those twin 
bills against I UP Ul 

In the opening game. Rick 
Stevens fired a two hitter, as 
be went the distance in a 7-2 
Tuskers victory. 

Stevens fell behind 1-0 in 
the top of the second inning. 
but the Ttiskers stormed 
back with three runs in their 
half of the Inning eoroute to 
the win 

Stevens is really the only 
veteran pitcher on the squad, 
after the loss of the nucleus 
of the pitching staff due to 
graduation and injury. 

Stevens had a rough start 
this season as he was hit 



hard m many appearances. 
As of late, Stevens has been 
exceptionally sharp. 

IPFW catcher, Ron Dull. 
from South Adams High 
School, said the reason for 
Stevens' early season 
problems was simple "Rick 
lifted weights in the off 
season, so 1 think he was 
tight in the early games. 
He's loose now and throwing 
the ball well." Dull said. 

The first game saw IPFW 
bang out twelve hits off two 
Indy hurlers. 

The second game was a 
different story, as the 
Tuskers went down by a 
score of 4-3. Mike Hendricks 
took the loss for the Tuskers, 
despite giving up only seven 
hits in his complete game 
effort. 

On Saturday Coach Larry 
Windmiller's squad played 
Wabash in a doubleheader, 
but probably \vished they 
hadn't. The Tuskers went 
down to defeat m both 
games. 4-1 , and, 9-5, 

Many of the players on the 
team believe that the reason 
for the dub's slow start is 



that experience is lacking at 
most positions. Having seven 
freshman in the lineup at 
once is a prime example of 
that lack of expenence, 
Doug Lehman, another 
South Adams graduate, 
thinks the team has turned 
the comer to a brighter 
future. 

"The Spring Arbor games 
really turned this team 
around. Even though we lost 
both games it really gave us 
confidence because we 
played them close all the 
way. From that point on we 
knew that we belonged on 
this baseball team," Leh- 
man said. 

Even though the team has 
a S-ii record, progress is 
seen "m every department of 
its game. If Coach Wind- 
miller has this team to- 
gether for a couple of years 
there's no telhng how good 
they can become. IfRonDull 
and Doug Lehman stay at 
the school for a few years, 
then just maybe their 
nickname will stick. The two 
South Adams graduates will 
become famous as the 
"Starf ire Connectioa ' '

Komets sink Admirals 



By MIKE FRANKE 
CblFl Reporter 
The Fort Wayne Kometa 
played their first round of 
the playoffs just as they 
played the last half of the 
regular season — up one 
night, down the next. 

Last Wednesday in 
Milwaukee the Komets lost 
to the Admirals, 4-2. The 
game tied the best of seven 
series at two games apiece 

That made ilsimple , , The 
Komets had only to win two 
of the three remaining 
games in order to advance to 
the I H.L playoffs The club 
would have two games in 
which they could capture the 
senes victory. 

In the firat four games of 
the playoffs, neither team 
could manage a victory on 
the other team's ice: but that 
tact changed as the 
Admirals traveled to Fan 
Wayne last Friday 

The Komets came out and 
played a lackluster first 
period, showing signs of a 
team that wasn't ready tor 



an important hockey game. 
The Admirals left the ice 
with a 1-0 lead at the end of 
the first period. 

The second period started 
the same way. as 
Milwaukee's Michel 
Bergeron scored to put the 
Admirals up by two goals 

The KomeU fought back to 
gain the lead early in the 
third period on goals by Gary 
Deling. Mike Penasse. and 
Terry Mcr&gt;ougall. 

With less than two minutes 
left to play. Cord SUfford 
scored to put Milwaukee 
back on lop, but the Komets 
didn't give up. DeL^ng 
netted his second goal with 
just over a minute In the 
game 

11 looked like overtime, but 
someone forgot to tell 
Milwaukee lo lay down and 
play dead for the last 
minute. The Admirals' 
Dwighl Schefield scored with 
eight seconds left on the 
clock. 

The Komets faced 



elimination from the 
playoffs the next night in 
Milwaukee. 

After Friday's game 
goalie Steve Janaszak left a 
message on Lhe blackt&gt;oard 
in the Komets' dressing 
room. It read, "The opera is 
not over until the fat lady 
sings." 

The fat lady didn't bring 
down the curtain on the 
Komets in Milwaukee, as 
the K's skated lo a 4-2 victory 
over the Admirals, After 
trailing Z-0 in the first period, 
the Komets came to life, 
scoring the final four goals, 
winning lhe game, and lying 
the series once again 

The fat lady did however 
bring the curtain down on the 
Milwaukee Admirab on 
Monday night at the 
Coliseum The Komets 
downed the Admirals, 7-4. 

Wednesday the Komets 
traveled to Sagjnaw foi the 
first game of the semi-finals, 
and the Gears will be in Fort 
Wayne on Friday,

basic plot remains the same. 

The Tusker men's 
volleyball team found a good 
script for its matches with 
Earlham. It has drama. 
excilement and. of course, a 
happy ending. Throu^oul 
the season, Earlham has 
battled the Tuskers almost 
spike for spike, block for

the end, the "good guys" 
have always won out.

Light appears at tunnel's end 



By'HMOTHYJ.ROSS 
Sports Editor 

The tunnel through which 
the men's tennis team is 
travelling has t&gt;een long and 
dark and not especially 
morale building, but there 
may be a light shining at the 
end of the tunnel to guide 
them through the season. 

This light began to flicker 
this past weekend in the 
match against Adrian 
College from Michigan. The 
first man on the Tusker 
lineup, Holden Maecker, 
played a part in the only two 
victories the men have 
achieved so far this year 

Maecker lost his first set 
against the number one 
Adrian man. 3-6. But 
Maecker, according locoach 



Ben Becker, "patiently and 
persistently matched Randy 
Payne stroke for stroke" to 
win the next two sets, 7-5, 7-6. 

Maecker and teammate 
Russ Carrol combined 
talents to defeat Payne and 
Steve Denbrock of Adrian in 
lhe first doubles match of the 
day. IPFW won the first set, 
6-3; lost the second, 4-6: and 
won the last, 6-1 

Although the Tuskers lost 
the match, 7-2, they did 
receive a needed boost in 
morale. "The team received 
a tremendous lift from the 
determined play of Maecker 
and Carrol," said Becker. 

If the light at the end of the 
tunnel is not just an on- 
coming train, the team has a 
chance to nin lhe season into 
a winning experience.

second and third games of 
the match, but both wenl 
down to the wire as Ball 
substituted freely. Despite 
losing the big leads, the 
reserves held their com- 
posure well, the coach said, 
considering the large and 
vocal crowd. The crowd was 
the largest the Tuskers have 
played against Ball said, 
with the exception of Ball 
Stale, which has enjoyed a 
strong following sice winning 
the first-ever MIVA crown in 
1%0, 

Two freshmen, Pat Menzie 
and Joe Hammons, earned 
Ball's praise for their play 
against Earlham. Menzie, a 
6-4 New Haven p-aduale, led 
the spikers with 12 kills and 
five stuff blocks. The 5-11 
Hammons, who played for 
Ball at Harding High School, 
spiked for 10 kills, as did 
junior Paul Wyss. Colin 
Leiter led the servers with 
five aces. 

IPFW hosted defending 
MIVA-champion Kellogg 
Community College Friday, 
and did not play well, ac- 
cording to Ball "We were 
really Oat." he said. 
"There's no reason why. We 
were just flat " The BatUe 
Creek, Mich., junior college 
swept the Tuskers, 15-6, 15-7, 
15-10. 

The Tuskers remain tied 



with Cincinnati for second ir^' 
the "non-power division"' 
with a 5-2 division record.' 
George Williams, the 
division leader at 6-1, hosts 
the Tuskers along witl^ 
"power-division" member' 
Wisconsin Saturday In: 
Chicago for the last matches; 
of the regular season. "r 

"Everything depends o(i 
Saturday," Ball said of th^ 
upcoming match at George: 
Williams, "That one's for the; 
season," If the Tuskers win,- 
IPFW will finish in a three- 
way tie for first with George! 
Williams and Cincinnati^ 
They will finish third if they; 
lose, missing the conference 
playoffs at Ohio State. - 

George Williams, former 
national champion in th^ 
collegiate division of th?

recognized the sport, 
defeated the Tuskers earlier. 
in the season in Fort Wayne,' 
However, IPFW beat Cin- 
cinnati in the Queen City, 
after losing at home to tht'

noting that they lack 
height, but are a scrappy and 
experienced team. i"
