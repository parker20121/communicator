a series of articles examining where 
IPFW graduates are now. 

With Its 30th birthday just around the

names were of people, who have con-

Honors program 
draws criticism 



Perspectives 

Writer wants 
less apathy 



Besides offering a variety o( honore 
courses, the IPFW honors program 
gives sludcnls the option of gradualing 
from either IV or Purdue with an honors 
cerliflcale it Uiey fuifill the necessary 
requirements. 

These requirements include suc- 
cessfully completing 18 hours o( honors 
classes, an honors project and one 
seminar representing at least Iwo 
disciplines. One must also maintain an 
accumulative GPA of 3.5 (lUi or 5.8 
(PU). 

The honors program was meant to be 
an enriching experience designed lo 
draw together students with superior 
Dcademic obilily from all areas of IPF- 
W However, because of reasons given 
by the sociology and anthropology 
department, the program should not be 
offered. 

The department's reasons are well- 
researched and include the following; 

1. The program perpetuates ihe 
s&gt;-slem of tracking, whereby students 
are "guided" by professors and coun- 
selors into types and levels of classes 
based on students' perceived abilities. 
These perceptions could contain biases 
against students based on their social 
background. 

2. Students could perceive honors 
classes as Ihe only kind worth taking. 



while looking on other classes lo be 
remedial, for "dummies." 

It this happens, IPFW could face 
enrollment problems because some 
students would not know what classes lo 
take. 

All classes should be worth taking and 
should be what Patrick Ashton, assistant 
professor of sociology, calls "real 
university education." 

3. Honors program classes may 
contain students who are more active in 
class conversations, while the quieter 
ones would be in non-honors courses. 
This could disruDi what Ashton calls 
"classroom dynamics." An eloquent 
student can offer a challenge lo bolh the 
professor and to other less talkative 
students. 

Even though Ihe honors program is 
intended lo benefit IPFW, it will not. » 
will divide the students into categories, 
such as average and gifted. 

Al IPFW, many students work while 
atlendine class. Those students mav 
lack Ihe time non-working sludcnls 
have to study and maintain (he grades 
necessary lo be in the honors program. 

If the a dm in is trail on is serious about 
maintaining this program, it should 
make all classes at IPFW honors
