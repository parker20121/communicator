General Assembly in session 



IPFW seeks funds 



By SANDRA WILEY 
Edltor-ln-chicf 

Several IPFW students may be 
bringing back funds for this campus 
'from Indianapolisnextweek.orat least 
the promise of funds. 
■ Steve Westrick, president of IPFWs 
I Student Senate, said that members of 
Students' Government will lobby Feb. 7 
in Indianapolis with a group of 
students' government members from 
many of the state's universities. The 
group will be lobbying the Indiana 
General Assembly for funding for 
higher education. 

One item being lobbied for by the 
IPFW group will be the reinstatement 
of funding for the furnishings of the new 
health, physical education and 
recreation (HPER) building to the 
.proposed state education budget. The 
more than S.5 million was deleted late 
last November from the amount 
originally granted IPFW for the HPER 
building's furnishings and equipment. 

In an article appearing in The 
'Communicator Dec. 4, 1930, John 
Ulmer, dean of student services, said 
that the job of having the S.5 million in 
funding of the HPER building rein- 
stated rests mainly back with area 



legislators, who he said were chiefly 
responsible for the passing of proposals 
for granting of funds to have the 
building erected. 

Future increases in tuition and fees at 
slate supported higher education 
facilities, including IPFW, will also be 
determined by (he amount of funds 
allocated by the Indian General 
Assembly, now in session. 

The budget allocations for IPFW 
depend upon the allocations granted to 
both IU and Purdue universities. 

John R. Carnaghi, IPFW vice- 
chancellor for financial affairs, said 
(hat the success of budget requests 
made lo the General Assembly in the 
off-budgel years (those of the short 
session of the legislature) were suc- 
cessful because of student in- 
volvement—letter writing and lobbying 
efforts. 

He said that a positive campaign by 
individual students and student groups 
could help the chances of IPFW 
requests being granted. Several are 
legislators, Carnaghi said, are working 
for the granting of IPFW requests, also, 
but most of the lobbying of Che 
legislature is being done by (he main 
campuses of IU and Purdue. 



The overall budget proposals for 
state supported universities face op- 
position in the General Assembly, and 
Carnaghi said the granting of the 
proposed budget is "not an optomistic 
picture," because of existing 
priorities— such as highways— now 
facing the legislature. 

Carnaghi said that among the Items 
asked for in IPFW's budget proposal 
include money for faculty salaries, 
general supplies and expenses, 
enrollment increases, unavoidable 
costs (such as higher utility bills), 
planned expansions, and quality im- 
provements (such as more instructors 
to lower the number of students per 
class). 

Recommendations by the State 
Budget Committee, which met in 
November to consider requests that 
had been made in September by 
universities, and which had then been 
reviewed by the Indiana Commission 
for Higher Education, indicate that 
little or no increase in allocations for 
higher education will be made. 

The budget committee recommended 
at thai time no increase in faculty 
salaries and a 12 percent increase in 



student fees each year of the 19B1-63 
Indiana University budget; for Purdue, 
similar recommendations were made. 

The committee recommended an 
overall .5 percent Increase In ap- 
propriations for higher education for 
1981-82 and no increase for 1982-83. 

Carnaghi said that the final budget 
requesls for IPFW will be made in 
early February, akthough preliminary 
requests were submitted to the trustees 
of both IU and Purdue universities last 
September. 

The budget requests for IPFW are 
part of statewide budget packages of 
both universities, Carnaghi said, but 
the dollar amounts asked for are 
determined by each local campus. 

The Commission of Higher Education 
madea positive recommendation of the 
requests submitted by IPFW in Sep- 
tember, Carnaghi said, and IPFW has 
been in a "defending mode" since then, 
backing up its requests with proof of 
need on each item requested in its 
budget proposal. 

"We're a high priority object, 
overall," Carnaghi said aboaut the 
legislature's response to budget 
allocation requests for higher 
education. 



"Winter tan possible in Fort Wayne 



Tanning booths provide 'sun 9 



ByKAROLHERBER 
Start Writer 

Fort Wayne sunbathers, frustrated 
with winter and unpredictable Indiana 
weather, need not Iravel all the way to 
Florida to have a tan year 'round. 

Currently located in town are 
established tanning salons which 
provide customers with tanning and 
skin conditioning services. Some 
beauty and barber shops, karate 
schools and other businesses also offer 
use of tanning equipment as a sideline 
lo their regular lineof business. 

While there have been some closings 
of tanning salons in this area within the 
past year because of lack of business, 
two are still functioning — two salons 
offering tanning service are The 
Tanning Booth. aS 4711 Lima Road, and 
Tan Fastic, at 5733 St. Joe Road, which 
opera(e on a daily basis, year 'round. 

The two salons are equipped with 
tanning booths and tanning beds, 
supervised and controlled by trained 
personnel there. 

The booth is used when a customer 
wishes to gradually build up (he 
pigment of his or her skin. This helps 
the skin to resist the burning rays of the 
sun arid starts conditioning the skin for 
a tan.' The ultraviolet lighting in (he 
booth does all the work and does not 
omit the most damaging rays found in 
the sun. Goggles or other eye protec- 
tions must be worn and people are 
instructed to stand in the middle of the 
booth to ensure an even exposure to the 
light. 

The bed, which has no burning ef- 
fects, is used mostly for gaining quick 
color, but the effects will not last as 
long as those of the booth. Because (he 
wavelength of light is different, it 
penetrates only the surface layer of 
skin and will fade more quickly than a 
deep, rich (an, according to owner and 
operator of Tan Fastic Rick Scranton. 
i Many times the beds are used by 
future brides "...who want a quick 
tan...'.' or just a lillle color for the 
wedding day. said Kathy Ginther. 




employee of The Tanning Booth. 

Children as young as 10 and adults as 
old as 75 use the facilities of the tanning 
booths, but the average age of clients 
frequenting Tan Fastic, according to 
Scranton, is the mid to late 20s Both 
salons, however, require (hose under 18 
to have written permission from a 
parent or guardian before they may use 
the equipment. 

Costs of the tanning services vary. 
but range from $4 for a one-time visit in 
(lie booth. S7 for the bed, to as much as 
S350 for an unlimited number of visits 
wilh a one year membership at Tan 
Fastic. 

The time spent in the boolh starts at 
approximately one and a half minutes 
and reaches a maximum of a 10 minute 
exposure. Tanners spend 30 minute 
segments on the bed, which is encased 
in wood. The ultraviolet lights are 
above and below the person and en- 
closed in plexiglas. 



Timers loealed outside of the booth 
and bed areas are controlled by salon 
personnel and are never handled solely 
by the customer. 

The Food and Drug Administration 
has recommended certain guidelines 
for tanning establishments to follow 
concerning maximum exposure time 
allowed for each person, types of bulbs 
used, efficiency of timers, etc. They 
also may make periodic checks at those 
places they know have tanning 
equipment to make sure things are 
operating efficiently, according to Bill 
Brubaker of (he local FDA. 

To ensure against possible injury to 
those whose skin may be too sensitive 
for (he lights, or for those who may be 
using certain medications, the salons 
have potential customers fill out an 
information form. Listed on these 
forms are questions pertaining to skin 
sensitivity, medical information, usual

tanning time in the sun and any other 
details on each person's individual 
coloring and skin type. 

The Tan Fastic salon, offering a 
computerized skin analysis, can verify 
and sel up a tanning program for the 
customer. By plugging answers into the 
computer, it comes up with a program 
the salon will recommend for the in- 
dividual to follow. The ideal tanning 
program would include visils lo bolh 
the bed and Ihe booth to insure proper 
conditioning of the skin, along with 

Concerning some allegations thai 
sunbathing may Be hazardous and a 
cause of skin cancer, and that tanning 
booths are just another means of 
contracting it, Rick Scranton thinks his 
way is safer than the sun, if it is used 
properly. While some people may 
deliberately go out into the sun and 
burn themselves up, Ihey could be 
building up their skin pigmentation in 
the tanning booths and getting a 
gradual exposure to the sun's rays. This 
lessens their chances of harming their 
skin and contracting skin cancer. 

Scrantonsaid, "As long as people are 
going out into the sun anyway lo get a 
tan, this equipment is no more or less 
harmful, and in most cases, less." He 
went on to say that "Anything can be 
harmful if jl isn't used properly." 

Bolh salons have had patients of 
dermatologists come to them for 
tanning and cosmetic treatments, and 
have had some referrals by the doctors. 
Because the ultraviolet lighting is the 
same as that used by dermatologists, 
said people at both places, they see no 
reason why Iheir method should be 
considered more dangerous lhan 
anything else. 

To their knowledge, personnel at both 
establishments have never had a 
customer burned or injured by either 
the booth or bed. Out of the ap- 
proximate 800 customers Scranton 
estimated he had served at Tan Fastic 
in the past year, he had onlv one 
complaint.

An increase in enrollment seems to 
have brought an increase in the number 
of cars on campus, and traffic exiting 
IPFW's main entrance at rush hour has 
become a concern for the campus 
police. 

Traffic congestion occurs at the 
campus intersection of the south and 
west outer drives. Chief Maurice 
Shady, head of Universily Safely and 
Police, is undertaking a project to try lo 
alleviate the problem. 

A campus police officer will be 
directing traffic at the intersection just 
north of (he Anihony Blvd. -Bypass 
intersection, daily from aboul 4:30-5:30 
p.m. 

Chief Shady attributed the cause of 



the traffic congestion to the awkward 
design of the main entrance and the 
increased number of cars which us 
He feels that the combination of 
students and administrative workers 
leaving campus around 5:00 makes 
traffic jam unavoidable. 

Shady said he is piloting the traffic 
directing project on a trial-and-error 
basis, and lhal feedback is necessary 
"We need to know if we are solving the 
problem or contributing to it," he 
emphasized. Drivers are urged to voice 
their reactions to the pilot project. 

The chief also urged drivers to exil 
out the east side of the campus onto 
Highway 37 (Crescent Ave.). He 
pointed out that west-bound drivers 
may find this a quicker route than the 
congested main entrance during rush 
hour.

"All property that is used, or in-

Indian pipe seen in some record shops 
near ihe incense. But it does if the 
smoke that comes out of thai con- 
iraption is from burning marijuana 
leaves. This is a quote from the 
marijuana paraphernalia s(a(ule as 
approved by Ihe Indiana Stale General 
Assembly on March 3, 1980, 

The key words of the new statute are 
"intent" and "possession." Under Ihe 
old paraphernalia law the stale did not 
have lo prove any intent to use a 
specific product for the purpose of 
smoking marijuana. This poinl was an 
important reason the law was later 
-struck down in a federal court as un- 
constitutional. 

Many items sold in "smoking shops" 
such -as clips, papers and some pipes, 
be used with tobacco, fntenl often is 
judged by how exotic Ihe particular 
item is, such as the larger water pipes 
—id howls which can run into hundreds 

—i— 



of dollars. Intent also can mean in- 
structions for use. 

For example: a customer walks into 
a shop advertising "contemporary 
products." He is dazzled by (he array of 
merchandise before him and ap- 
proaches Ihe manager Professing 
ignorance in such matters, the 
customer asks for instructions as to the 
use of lhal rather large, neon green and 
purple water pipe in the corner. The 
manager anticipates a sale and ex- 
citedly tells the customer all the ins and 
outs of using this particular model and 
the deep satisfaction he is sure lo get 
from its use. 

After getting evidence lhal Ihe pipe is 
used for something other than Prince 
Albert in a tin. the customer reveals 
himself as a police officer and Invites 
the manager to the police station to 
repeat his sales pitch. 

"The nature of Ihe shops advertising 
and instruction on merchandise use is 
important in determining intent," said 
Steve Johnson, the state prosecutors' 
conclll's director of research in 
Indianapolis." If the case is a first 
offense, the store owner might simply 
be asked to voluntarily remove such 
merchandise from the shelves, be given 
a suspended sentence or a fine." he 
continued. 



This is what the slore owner or clerk 
-an expect, but what about buyers who 
may find an uninvited guest with a 
badge at their next party? 

Many area prosecutors who don't 
have smoking shops in their jurisdic- 
tion (real paraphernalia differently. 
"When we confiscate someone's pipe 
we always look for marijuana residue. 
Then we charge the perosn with 
possession." said L. David Lour, Noble 
County prosecuting attorney. 
Possession is neither new nor con- 
troversial and is treated as a Class D 
misdemeanor. 

Since Its introduction, the new law, 
like Ihe old, has been Ihe subject of 
controversy. This past fall the new law 
had Us first court test in Indianapolis 
Federal District Court and was upheld. 
This reflects a national trend in several 
stales where statutes have been ap- 
proved by federal courts. 

A fearful altitude toward Ihe new law 
is readily seen around Fort Wayne. All 
proprietors of shops selling 
paraphernalia, either as a primary 
product or sideline, who were ap- 
proached by The Communicator 
refused any comment. The manager of 
Paraphernalia Palace cites her reason 
as "A bad treatment by Ihe local 
media " 



As research on this story progressed, 
more and more parallels with the old 
obscenity law controversy seemed to 

appear. Laur and Johnson agreed that 
vagueness has been the biggest 
problem in the past with bolh Ihe old 
paraphernalia and obscenily laws. 
Varying community standards and 
discretions of individual judges and 
juries have also caused difficulties. 

On this subject Lauer said thai be 
would rather take a case like (his to a 
jury because a Judge would be likely lo 
be more technical on the letter of the 
law than a jury and make a finding 
based more on emotion and personal 
morals." "A jury might be more 
swayed by the visual impact of an 
exolic pipe there in front of them," 
Laur explained. 

"In bolh cases it comes back to in- 
tent," said Johnson. "The prosecuting 
attorney must show Intent to sell either 
pornography or paraphernalia." 

"But there is one important dif- 
ference," Johnson continued. "With 
pornography you arc dealing with the 
first ammendmenl lo the constitution 
which stales a basic right to read or 
print. With paraphernalia there is no 
such const ilul ion al right to take 
drugs."

Rising costs... 
but no funds? 



While IPFW and other universities 
face drains on their financial resources 
caused by increased enrollments, larger 
utility bills, the need for more money for 
the rising costs of general supplies and 
expenses and the need to raise faculty 
and staff salaries, the State Budget 
Committee is recommending only a .5 
percent increase in appropriations for 
higher education for 1981-82 and no in- 
crease for 1982-83. 

In presenting the state budget com- 
mittee's recommendations last 
November, John Huie, state budget 
director, said faculty raises could be 
provided by universities through student 
fee increases and cuts in other univer- 
sity programs. 

While not all of Indiana's legislators 
nor residents agree with this seemingly 
light-fisted fiscal conservatism and 
seeming resentment of higher 
education, enough of the state's 
legislature may feel that the November 4 
election was a mandate for the 
Republican legislature to move toward 
more conservative government and thus 
vote for this limited increase in higher 
education funding. 

According to both Democratic and 
Republican legislators, the. state has 
fallen on hard times financially, and it 
will lake a major effort to increase 
funding for programs such as higher 
education. 

They do not agree about the cause of 
the stale's financial woes, however. 

Democrats say that one of the major 
causes is the income tax reduction 
passed by the General Assembly in 1979, 
which reduced the state income tax levy 
from 2 percent to 1.9 percent, cost the 
state S70 million and caused severe 



cutbacks in essential services, among 
them education. 

The legislature which passed the tax 
reduction was predominantly 
Republican, as is the 1981 legislature 
now in session. 

The Democrats say that the 
Republicans who voted for the tax 
decrease thinking they could maintain 
services were extremely naive. 

Republicans say that the state is 
suffering because most tax receipts, 
especially those from the state gasoline 
tax, are down because of the present 
condition of the economy. State Rep. 
Jerry Bales (R-60lh District) introduced 
a bill Nov. 18, 1980 to increase the gas tax 
from 8 percent to 10 percent, to help 
increase the state's income. 

Regardless of the reason for Indiana's 
economic hard times, the universities in 
Indiana that cannot increase the wages 
of their faculty members and the 
students who are forced to pay 10 per- 
cent to 12 percent more in tuition and 
fees are the ones that will suffer if the 
recommendations of the State Budget 
Committee are approved by the General 
Assembly. 

Let's not stand idly by and watch this 
happen. 

Any person who feels that to attract 
and keep quality faculty people at IPFW 
and who feels that a 12 percent hike in 
tuition and fees is impossible to tolerate 
should take pen or phone in hand and 
contact each (and every) representative 
from this area in the 1981 General 
Assembly. Tell them there is a need for 
increases in funding for higher 
education.

January 20 was a "per- 
fect" day according to 
Ronald Reagan ; he was 
inaugurated and the 52 
Americans held hostage for 
444 days by Iran were 
released. 

Reagan, a former actor, 
became the 40th chief 
executive, replacing Jimmy 
Carler of Plains, Georgia. 
He is the oldest to take the 
oath, just 17 days shy of 70 
years old, and the first 
divorced president. 

Reagan pledged to the 
nation in his inaugural ad- 
dress an "era of national 
renewal." His theme, "a new 
beginning," seemed to lake 
more meaning when the 52 
hostages' release came just 
less than an hour into his 
presidency. 

In his first speech as 
president, Reagan pledged 
with confidence (hat he will 
restore the economy. He 
stressed that federal 
restraints, mainly over 
taxation, needed to be 
reduced. He also pledged lo 
cut unnecessary over- 
spending by the federal 
government. 

"We must act today in 
order to preserve 
tomorrow," he said. "And lei

With the inauguration of 



Reagan only a few days ago, we decided 

to poll some students and ask Hheir 

Ronald opinions about the president. 



They said...

"I don't think he'll make a good 

president because he's so strong on so 

many issues, like busing. I don't think 

anyone can fix the economy," Peggy 

/ O'Hara, liberal arts major. 




"I think he'll be an adequate 

president. The people he chose for 

government are going to have a greater 

influence. In the times we live in now, we 

should ask if our problems are un- 
controllable and should we rely on our 

government so much," Mike Wilcox, 

chemistry graduate student 

"I think his inexperience will hurt him 
in dealing with all the matters as a 
president. He won't be a good president 
but an adequate one. He could ac- 
complish anything he wanted to with the 
mandate he received in the election and 
with the Republicans gaining control of 
the Senate and the House, " Steve 
Westrick, social studies major. 
"I think he'll be a good, strong 

president. At this time, I feel he is what 

our country needs. But I do disagree 

with his stand on abortion and equal 

righls. I'm in favor of his strong 

defense," Bob Pease, marketing major.

"It's loo early to tell what he'll be able 
to do but I think that as long as Reagan 
doesn't go back to 1950 ideas and can 
understand what U.S. is about in the '80s, 
he'll make an effective president,"

major.

to act beginning today." 

And shortly after 
delivering his address, 
Reagan did just that. He 
signed a presidential order, 
freezing the hiring of civilian 
employees by all executive 
departments and agencies.

Tutoring 
cut 

By JACKIE WIORA 
Staff Writer 

The free tutoring program 
has been drastically cur- 
tailed again, said Michael 
O'Hear, coordinator of 
Transitional Studies. "The 
program was funded by a 
grant," O'Hear said, "and 
the money ran out. The 
demand exceeded the 
budget," 

The tutoring program was 
cut last year (o include only 
lOO-level courses. This 
semesler it has been cut 
even more. "Luckily this 
won't affect too many 
people," O'Hear said. He 
explained thai the classes 
where the most tutoring is 
needed are still being ser- 
viced by the program. 

The courses still included 
in the program are Math 111 
and 153, Chemistry 100, 
Modern Foreign Language 
111, English 100, 130 and 131, 
and a few other classes. 
"Tutoring is still available 
for other courses at a cost of 
S3. 35 an hour," the coor- 
dinator said. 

O'Hear explained that the 
cut was partially caused by 
the minimum wage hike, and 
by the large number of 
students using the tutoring 
program.

Although the release of (he 
52 American hostages up- 
staged the former actor's 
day, Washington and the new 
President and First Lady 
still enjoyed the 811 million 
inaugural. The extravagant 
events of the day, all paid for 
by private donations, in- 
cluded eight formal balls, 
various Hollywood stars, and 
the biggest fireworks display 
seen in the Capitol, It was the 
most expensive inaugural 
ever put on lo welcome a new 
president. Four years ago. 
Carter's inaugural events 
cost only $5 million. 

While Reagan and the 
Republicans were enjoying 
their victory, Jimmy Carler 
headed back to Plains, 
Georgia lo be greeted by his 
hometown in what they 
termed "the biggest covered 
dish" party. 

Carter spent only three 
hours in the rainy small town 
before jetting back to 
Washington to join the 
special envoy and 

welcoming committee for 
the newly freed hostages. 
From Washington he went to 
Weisbaden, West Germany, 
where he spent an 
emotionally Tilled visit with 
the freed Americans. 

He then returned back to 
Plains where he planned to 
spend (he next few weeks 
relaxing. He later plans to 
write and set up his library. 

Reagan won the election in 
a landslide of electoral votes, 
483 to 49. With his victory, 
the Republicans gained 
control of a Senate held by 
Democrats for over 20 
years. 

The Moral Majority led by 
Jerry Farwell claimed that 
Ihey helped make the 
Republican victory possible. 
During Reagan's 

inauguration, tens of 
thousands of prayer 
meetings were held across 
the nation, symbolizing the 
need for a "nation under 
God." 

One such prayer meeting 
was held here at IPFW, 
sponsored by the Inter-

Bill protects 



"Animal Cruelty (Let's 
write it off!)" could be the 
motto used to promote a bill 
(SB 308) currently being co- 
sponsored by Senators 
Douglas Hunt and Dan 
Manion in the Indiana 
General Assembly. SB 308 
would strengthen and more 
clearly define the law 
regarding animal cruelty 
cases. 

Presently, it must be 
proved that the person 
charged with animal cruelty 
was "intentionally and 
knowingly cruel." This is a 
major loophole in t he-current 
animal cruelty law which 
allows a lot of people to get 
off the hook rather easily, 
say proponents of the bill. SB 
308 will delete this clause 
completely because of its 
ambiguity and vagueness. 

"Animal cruelly is one of 



the major problems con- 
fronting animal welfare 
organizations today. It is 
therefore imperative that 
Indiana have concise and 
succinct laws, rid of 
loopholes, in order for 
animal cruelty cases to be 
tried effectively and fairly," 
said Suzy Scare, president of 
UFA. 

University Friends of 
Animals is asking staff, 
students, and faculty to write

Ministry helps 
with decisions 



• f r 



By GLORIA H1ZER 
Staff Writer 

"There is probably no 
other time in one's life when 
one searches and questions 
self, the world, and religion 
more than during college." 
It is on this concept that the 
Greater Fort Wayne Campus 
Ministry, Inc., (GFWCM) is 
based. 

GFWCM, located in Walb 
Memorial Union, Room 221, 
actively seeks to meet the 
religious and personal needs 
of students, whether or not 
they are currently involved 
with the church. 

The ministry feels that the 
counseling it provides is one 
of the most effective ways of 
helping students who are 
confronted with religious, 
ethical or moral dilemmas. 

Finding answers to these 
questions and others is the 
major concern of Fr. 
Lawrence Kramer, diocesan 
director of the Fort Wayne- 
South Bend Campus 
Ministry, and the Rev. 
Joseph P. Watkins. Both are 
dedicated to providing an 

cumenical Christian 

inistry to colleges and 

ii versifies in the Fort 
Wayne area. 

Kramer stressed that 
because of the nature of the 
IPFW campus, theirs is a 
rather non-traditional type 
f ministry. Kramer said, 
We don't have a chapel with 
. regular Sunday worship 
program." Instead, they 
depend heavily on weekday 
tact with individuals or 
ill groups and find 



IlK-r 



selvi 



doing life- 
decision types of counseling 

informal religious 
education. "Sometimes we 

ited into classrooms 



to help with religious, ethical 
and historical things," 
Kramer said. 

Watkins, a graduate of the 
University of Pennsylvania 
and Princeton Theological 
Seminary, has been on the 
staff since October, 1979, and 
works alongside Kramer, 
giving counsel and guidance. 
"The problems that students 
have run the gamut from A 
to Z," said Watkins. 

Some of their concerns are 
parental problems, and he 
observed that the stress on 
students attending college 
and living at home produces 
the difficulty of com- 
municating effectively with 
their parents. In some cases 
they find it necessary to 
discuss the problem with a 
campus minister. 

"In other cases there are 
very definite issues of faith 
that come into focus, and 
students seek the counsel of 
campus ministers when (hey 
are unsure of where they 
stand as Christians, within 
the context of the society we 
live in and within the context 
of the school, " said Watkins. 

The ministry's "open door 
policy," which allows 
students to drop in anytime 
to talk informally about 
anything, promotes an at- 
mosphere of ease so students 
will feel more comfortable in 
discussing more serious 
concerns, should they arise. 

Watkins' definition of 
counseling is as broad as his 
smile. He explained that 
counseling encompasses

wide-range referral basis. It 
works with other agencies 
and connects individuals in 
need of academic coun-

assistance to the proper 
community service agency. 

Kramer finds it difficult to 
elaborate on the success 
rate of the campus ministry, 
but feels encouraged 
because people keep coming 
back. "You apply the same 
criterion that you would 
apply to street preaching: if 
(hey keep coming, you must 
be contributing something," 
he said. 

Watkins also believes that 
campus ministry has 
established a firm presence 
at IPFW and feels very 
positive that GFWCM is 
becoming further visible on 
other local campuses as 
well. 

In addition to serving 



IPFW, it ministers to th. 
other metro campuses of 
Indiana Institute of 
Technology, Indiana 
Vocational Technical 
College, International 
Business College and St. 
Francis College. 

The Greater Fori Wayne 
Campus Ministry, Inc., a 
not-for-profit organization, is 
supported by financial 
contributions from com- 
munity churches, in- 
dividuals and organizations. 

Kramer and Watkins are 
available to students, as well 
as faculty and staff mem- 
bers, for counseling and 
information, 24 hours a day, 
7 days a week, through 
Student Services. 

Individuals of all 
denominations and faiths are 
invited to seek guidance 
through campus ministry to 
better understand and deal

UGA makes plans 



By V1CKI SCOTT 
Staff Writer 

Activities are just 
beginning for the University 
Gay Activists (UGA) on the 
IPFW campus. The group 
met for the first time of the 
semester on Jan. 26, and 
plans were made to meet bi- . 
weekly in the noon free 
period 

The group's primary aim 
is lo help educate 
the campus about 
homosexuality, members of 
the UGA said. One of the 
group's spokesperson's, 
Mary Voors, IPFW student, 
explained that the UGA 
wishes to extend an in- 
vitation for any of the faculty 
to call on the group through 



the organization's mailbox, 
located in the Students' 
Government suite in the 
Walb Memorial Union. The 
UGA feels that by raising the 
awareness of others in 
regard to homosexuals and 
homosexuality, they will 
help to narrow the gaps 
which lea^d to prejudice. 

The UGA's new advisor, 
Kathy Squadrito, is an 
assistant professor of 
philosophy at IPFW. 

"The whole philosophy 
department is willing to 
support and cooperate with 
all of the group's activities," 
said Clark Butler of the 
philosophy department. 

Although the campus UGA 
is not officially affiliated 



with the larger Fort Wayne 

gay movement, double 
participation is prevelant 
among UGA members. 
Membership last semester 
was low— between six and 
12— but the group is op- 
timistic the number will 
increase because the subject &lt; 
of sexuality is now more 
openly discussed. 

The activities of the UGA 
will be decided in its future 
meetings, and the group is 
planning to be active on 
campus this semester. One 
activity planned by the UGA 
is to make speeches before 
various classes to try to 
educate both faculty 
members and students 
abbout homosexuality.

^Tribute* nee ds script 



Lemmon saves film 



By M1KK GEPFEN 
Staff Writer 

"Tribulc" is designed 
primarily lo showcase Jack 
Lemmon 's considerable 
lolents. As e vehicle for 
Lemmon, the film works 
perfectly. However, il is too 
bad there is no) much else lo 
recommend it. 

The film is melodramatic, 
trite, but ultimately ef- 
fective due lo Lcmmon's 
skilled performance. 
Lemmon plays Scottie 
Templeton, a runabout who 
chucked a somewhal 
promising writing career in 
Hollywood to work fora P R 
firm in New York. Scottie 
has a small problem. He has 
cancer, and because of this, 
he Iries to reconcile his 
relationship with his son, 
who he walked out on. 

The plot sounds as though 
it could have been lifted 
from a soap opera, and 
unfortunately, except for a 
few outstanding scenes, it 
never raises above that 
level What is remarkable is 
that Lemmon makes it 
palatable, suds and all. 

Lemmon is clearly ai the 
peak of his talent, and he 
gives a well-rounded 



characterization. He simply 
blows most of the other 
actors off the screen, with 
Ihe exception of Lee Remick, 
as Tcmplelon's ex-wife. She 
gives 8'low'-key performance 
that counterbalances 
Lemmon 's nicely. Their 
scenes together are among 
the high points of the film. 

Lemmon and Remick are 
good, but I he acting of Robby 
Benson, as Jud, Templcton's 
son, is another matter en- 
tirely After years of being 
typecast as the new Jack 
Armstrong, All-American, in 
films like "One on One" and 
"Die Laughing," Benson 
graduated to the big leagues 
in "Tribute." II is apparent 
that he should be sen! back 
to the farm clubs. He plays 
Jud with no subtlety, and his 
characterization is devoid of 
life. 

All Ihe blame can't be put 
on Benson, Ihough, because 
the scriptwriter didn't give 
him much to work wilh. 
Bernard Slade, who adapted 
the script from his play 
makes Jud so straight-laced 
and one-dimensional, you 
wonder why Scottie is 
bothering with him in the 
first place. Slade does well 



by the other characters, 
even (hough the dialogue 
sometimes sounds hollow. 

The main problem with 
the script is that Slade 
belabors the point thai 
Scottie is a great guy. 
Granted, the film is titled 
"Tribute," and Scottie is Ihe 
main character, but to have 
a character say things like, 
"Scottie gives people life," 
and "Scottie has his arms 
open to the whole world" 
practically every ten 
minutes is overdoing it. 
Slade can craft a good scene, 
and the Film's best moments 
are evidence of it, but he gels 
no help from Ihe director, 

Bob Clark, the director, 
can't take the slaginess out 
of the material. He lingers 
on the pronouncements that 
Scottie is a great guy, and 
makes the characters extoll 
Scotlie's virtues with joy on 
their faces as Ihough the 
audience is upposed to ex- 
perience this joy by osmosis. 
His pacing lends to flatten 
out any life the scenes have. 
and were it not for the 
energy of Lemmon and some 
of the other actors, the film 
wouldn't have any spark at 
all.

Disco dying fast at local pubs 



Fleetwood Mac goes live 



McVie, Nicks sparkle 



By M1CHELE DE VINNEY 
Chief Reporter 

If an arlisl consislently 
sells millions of records and 
has a faithful following of 
fans, it's pretty safe to 
assume a live album will 
eventually be released. 

Fleetwood Mac is no ex- 
ception Their latest is a 
chronicle of the 10-month, 
worldwide tour which suc- 
ceeded the "Tusk" album 
of last year. 

Although many live 
albums tend to be glorified 
greatest hits packages. 
"Fleetwood Mae Live," 
while including some of the 
Top 40 songs that pul them 
on the map, goes beyond a 
mere rehashing of past 
glories. 

In addition to material 
from their last three sludio 
efforts, also included are 
three new songs, a Lindsey 



Buckingham tune from his 
1973 album with Stevie 
Nicks, and a fine rendition of 
"Oh Well," the group's sole 



hit 



their 






Buckingham-Nicks years. 

Despite Buckingham's 
recent dominance, the besl 
music continues (o come 
from the women in the 
group 

Christine McVie's vocals 
are smoother here than ever 
before, and her 

songs— especially "Over My 
Head" and "One More 
Night"— provide some of the 
best moments on the double 
LP 

The presence of Nicks 
adds some much needed 
sparkle Her performances 
of "Sara," "Landslide," and 
"Dreams" are as solid live 
as they were in the studio. 

She also deserves much 
credit for the set's tour de

beautifully enhances the 
haunting quality of her lyrics 
and melody, and Ihe in- 
strumental accompaniment 
of the other band members is 
exceptional. 

The production and mixing 
are far superior to those of 
many live recordings 
Although the crowd is 
audible, it never overpowers 
the musicians, and the sound 
quality is free of distracting 
noises. 

However, the choice of 
material is somewhat 
questionable. Of 18 songs, 
only four are from the highly 
acclaimed "Rumours," and 
"Tusk" is even more 
slighted. The album would 
benefit greatly with fewer of 
the older and weaker 
Buckingham offerings and 
more of the group's recent 
music.

By TIM SMITH 
Staff Writer 

Is disco dying? 

If the Fort Wayne bars are 
any indication the answer is 
probably yes. Many of (he 
Summit City's drinking 
establishments that up to 
now have been strictly disco 
oriented are beginning to 
make a change to live 
rock'n'roll. What is occuring 
is not a return to heavy 
metal, but a move in the 
direction of DOR (dance 
oriented rock). 

Often labeled as New 
Wave, which is a misnomer 
in this writer's opinion. DOR 
is, as the name would 
suggest, more of an all in- 
clusive form of get on your 
feet and dance (rock'n'roll]. 
Play lists range from more 
contemporary tunes by 
artists such as Billy Joel and 
AC-DC to early material of 
such immortal greats as the 
Beatles and Beach Boys. 

Last week I ventured in to 
Ihe streets to take a look at 
several of this fair city's 
bistros that are making this 
change from disco to DOR. 
Being more than just a little 
skeptical of any establish- 



ment ever bearing the lable 
"disco," whal I found was, 
barring one exception, a 
pleasant surprise. Here is 
the lowdown on three of 
these alehouses. 

In the interest of disposing 
of that one exception, here's 
the scoop on Mingles. 
Mingles misses the boat as 
far as I'm concerned. 

After walking through the 
door 1 headed directly for the 
bar as would any seasoned 
patron of rock 'n' roll joints. 
I found myself wallowing a 
veritable sea of dacron 
polyester leisure suits. The 
clientele of this place was 
mostly over weight , out- 
dated businessmen. They 
looked about as out of place 
as a classical cellist at a Sex 
Pistols concert. 

Arriving at the bar, I 
ordered my usual scotch and 
water, which much to my 
displeasure, seemed to have 
barely a full shot of booze in 
il. Weak drinks at two bucks 
a crack really ruffle my 
feathers. 

The decor is a real 
scream. There are pillars 
placed around the dance 
floor, which doubles as a j 



stage. Now, these pillars 
have disco type lights in 
them and we all know that in 
Ihe interest of safety, light 
bulbs cannot be left bare 
people could possibly bump 
into them. Well, theRamada 
Inn corporation, who ob- 
viously has ample funds to 
provide some sort of 
protective material, 



dhof 



instei 



of 



plexiglass, which would 
have looked good, chicken 
wire. They have got to be 
kidding. 

The band, called 
Endgame, was pretly 
mediocre, although they did 
play a really hot Beach Boys 
set. Endgame has been 
around for abour 15 years 
and though they have not 
been actively working the 
bar circuit, (hey surface 
occasionally for a gig or two. 
Unfortunately, what used to 
be one of Fort Wayne's 
hottest bands has now 
slipped into the realm of 
garbage rock 'n' roll. Too 
bad. 

Oh yes, before I forget, if 
nothing else, the bathrooms 
at Mingles were spotless. 

Overall, on a scale of one 



to ten, Mingles rates about a 
three. 

Chasers, in the Holiday 
Inn northwest, gives its 
patrons an interesting blend 
of live music and disco. The 
interior design of Chasers is 
well planned with an area set 
aside from the dance floor 
where one can carry on a 
conversation without having 
to compete with the music. 
The dance floor itself is large 
and there is a separate stage 
Tor the band. 

The drinks are fairly 
expensive at $2.45, but large 
enough to be reasonable. The 
crowd is excellent, being 
made up of mostly college 
age people, many of them 
IPFW students. 

The band. Remote Con- 
trol, played mostly top 40 
tunes with several pleasant 
surprises including a set of 
older songs by Sly and the 
Family Stone. All of their 
copy material was ex- 
tremely well done and very 
dance oriented In between 
sets a disc jockey took over 
and the dancing was done to 
recorded disco. 

On the same rating scale 



as Mingles, Chasers scores a 
solid eight 

I have decided to save the 
best for last. Shalimar, 4201 
Wells, offers a week's worth 
of drink specials thai cannot 
be ignored. On Monday, 
Wednesday and Thursday 
from 9-11 p.m., Shalimar 
provides all Ihe beer and 
margarilas the bar goer 
can drink for $1.99. On 
Tuesday, which is new wave 
night, tequila sunrises are 
available for a modest 75 
cents each and on Friday, 
shots of tequila and bourbon, 
and glasses of beer are SO 
cents from9to llp.m. 

Shalimar is leaning more 
and more towards DOR as 
disco takes a back seal lo 
rock 'n' roll. The decor is 
beyond a doubt Ihe best in 
town. The chairs are all 
padded and very com- 
fortable and the music is 
never so loud as to stifle 

that frequents Shalimar is 
much like that at Chasers. 

With its low prices, 
comfortable atmosphere and 
good music, Shalimar hits' 
the top of the scale with a 
rating ofnine.

"Rain, sleel or snow won't 
keep us from our appointed 
cuttes." This old familiar 
saying not only applies to the 
city postal workers, but 
holds true for the campus 
postal service as well 

The postal workers have 
only been deterred from 
their jobs once in the nine 
years that Floyd Herdman, 
supervisor of Shipping and 
Receiving, has been at IP- 
FW, and that was during the 
blizzard of 1978. 

The mail personnel 
processed about 450,000 
pieces of mail during Ihe 
fiscal year of 1978-79 at a cosl 
of $45,000 to the university, 
according to Dean Frier- 
mood, assistant director of 
purchasing. That amounted 
to approximately 2,000 
pieces of mail per day, as 
enumerated by Herdman. 

■'From now until Spring 
tends to be the rush season 
because the publishing 
companies are sending out 
complementary books and 
materials for peofessors to 
review," Herdman said, and 
added that he thought it must 
be the publishing season. 

Mail deliveries are made 
twice a day on campus, twice 
downtown to the Department 
of Genera! and Technical 
Studies and other IPFW 
buildings, and one to the Post 
Office. 

Shipping and Receiving 
also takes care of inter- 
department mailing.

Herdman was appointed 
supervisor in December 1980 
by Friermood, after the 
retirement of Steve Freek 
Herdman has been working 
in Shioping and Receiving 
for nine years. 

Herdman said he likes 
supervising and claims it's 
more challenging than being 
a clerk, however he admits 
the two jobs are similar. 

The qualifications for a 
clerical job include, "Some 
common sense, the ability to 
get along with people, the 
ability to assume respon- 
sibility and some patience 
helps," said Nancy Grote, 
one of the four employees 
under Herdman, 



and Gerry Goss work sorting 
ind Receiving Department. 

Grote, like Herdman, 
enjoys her work. She said 
that her job is set up in such 
a way that she works in a 
different building every 
three weeks, allowing her to 
work with many people. 

While processing the mail 
is the primary objective, 
other duties under Shipping 
and Receiving includelaking 
care of the property ac- 
counts, ordering office 
supplies. and storing 
equipment. 

Shipping and Receiving 
along with Payroll- 
Personnal and other ad- 
ministrative jobs are under 
the control of Purdue

Will their dream come true? 

V-ball season to begin 



By JENS M. SORENSEN 
Start Writer 
Cinderella not withstanding, fairy godmothers just 
don't pop in often enough. 

Dreams-come-true are directly proportional to the 
effort applied to making them come true. That's the 
First Law of Reality. It is therefore axiomatic that 
nothing comes to he who sits on his duff and waits. 

Arnie Ball, coach of IPFW's men's volleyball team, 
has a dream— a rather large one, in fact. Applying the 
First Law to this dream, 11 may just come true— and 
IPFW will become a national power in men's 
volleyball 

Just three years ago, volleyball at IPFW was 
something women played on the varsity level and men 
played on the beaches. Now the men play a major 
collegiate varsity schedule that includes the likes of 
Ohio Stale, Wisconsin, Ball State, Cincinnati and 
Pittsburgh. 

Men's volleyball at IPFW began as a club sport two 
years ago when Ball, who coaches both boy's and girl's 
volleyball at Harding High School, convinced Gordon 
Stauffer, former IPFW athletic director, that it was 
feasible. With a nucleus of men who had ployed for Ball 
at Paul Harding and funding coming largely from their 
own pockets, intercollegiate men's volleyball at IPFW 
was born. 

Last year funding came through for the team and the 
Tuskers embarked on their initial season of varsity 
competition. They finished with a 9-20 record, seventh 
in the eight-team Midwest Intercollegiate Volleyball 
Association. 

The MICA is divided into two divisions, the power 
and non-power divisions, depending on the standings of 
the previous season. The power division consists of 
Ohio State, Ball State, Wisconsin and Kellogg Com- 
munity College of Battle Creek, Mich. Competing 



with IPFW in the non-power division are Cincinnati, 
Earlham. George Williama of Chicago and a new 
member. Toledo. Each school plays the schools in its 
own division twice and those in the other division at 
least once. 

The winner of the MIVA goes to the NCAA Division I 
post season tournament to compete for the notional 
championship. Three other teams compete with the 
MIVA champ for the crown, one team from the East 
Coast conference and two from the West Coast league, 
the traditional power in men's volleyball. "USC and 
UCLA have dominated the sport," Ball said. 

Practices began Jan. 6, but "The door is open for 
anyone who is interested in trying out," Coach Boll 
said He emphasized that even those with no formal 
previous volleyball experience are welcome at the 
practices. If interested, contact the athletic depart- 
ment. There are currently eight men practicing and 
Ball hopes for a traveling squad of 10. 

"We incorporate the same kinds of offenses and 
defenses they use in the Olympics," said Ball, who 
has competed on a national level for 13 years and 
played in the U.S. Volleyball Association finals last 
year in Portland. 

"I'm excited. The future is obviously really bright 
here," he continued, referring to the scheduled com- 
pletion of the new gymnasium in July and anticipating 
the offering of athletic scholarships for men's 
volleyball "in the very near future." 

Last year, Kellogg Community College won the 
MIVA, although Ohio State competed in the national 
finals since Kellogg is not a member of the NCAA. "If a 
junior college like Kellogg can become a national 
power," Ball concluded, "then there's no reason why 
we can't." Not even with the absence of a fairy god- 
mother. 



Tuskers outsized on road 



ByJIMCHAPMAN 
Chief Reporter 

IPFW men's basketball 
coach Ken Workman 
summarized the past three 
performances of his team 
with one sentence: "After 
playing so many games on 
the road, we're on a mental 
down right now." 

Evidence of this statement 
was revealed as IPFW was 
defeated by Tri-Stale, IUPU- 
Indanapolis, and IU 
Southeast. 

Against Tri-State, the 
Tuskers played their op- 
ponents even in the first hair, 
but were still out scored 35- 
32. 

"We did an adequate job of 
finding (he open man for the 
good shot," commented 
Workman. 

In the second half, Tri- 
State's size (6'9", 6'7", and 
8'5" front line) began to set 
an immediate tempo that 
blitzed the Tuskers and 
nullified any of their chances 
of a comeback. 

About three minutes into 
the second half, Rickio Smith 
and Brian Grady. IPFW's 
big guns, both picked up 
their fourth personal fouls 
and had to sit down. Both 
returned later on in the 
game, but had to sit down 
again for the last lime as 
they fouled out. 

rPFW was down 70-59 
midway through the second 
half when they tried un- 
successfully for a final run to 
come back. Tri-Slale went on 
to beat the Tuskers 99-7B. 



Coliseum fills with fumes 



ByMIKEFRANKE 
Staff Writer 

On Sunday afternoon the 
Allen County Memorial 
Coliseum had a different 
sound and scent to its in- 
terior. The sound of pucks 
banging off the fiberglass 
boards could not be heard 
on that day. There were no 
basketballs being dribbled or 
shot. The floor was bare, and 
the boards and chairs were 
nowhere in sight. 

All that could be heard was 
engines winding and tires 
screeching through the 
turns. The smell of gasoline 
fumes was in the air. 

The event was the United 
Slates Auto Club's USAC's 
second and final Midget 
Racing card of the year at 
the Coliseum. 

Earlier this month the 
drivers came to Fort Wayne 
and veteran Steve Cannon 
walked away with the 
winners share of the ?5-lap 
feature race purse. That 
victory gave Cannon three 
victories in feature race 
competition on the circuit 
this season. 

Cannon had 26 points 
coming into the final Fort 
Wayne slop, which lied him 
with Steve Lolshaw going 
into Sunday's action. Lot- 
shaw is also a three-time 
feature race winner this

Coliseum Jan. 25. The winner Bob Wente Sr. led the race from start to finish, (Photo by 
Itolden M .ii t. i,i-i- ! 



The big showdown bet- 
ween Cannon and Lotshaw 
did not materialize as 
Cannon experienced car 
trouble and failed to make 
the field in the feature race. 

Lotshaw claimed the 
championship in the midget 
division even though he 
didn't win the Hoosier 100, 
the big raceof the day. All he 
had to do was finish the race 
to accumulate enough points 
to win the championship, 
since Cannon failed to moke 
the feature race. 

Lotshaw ran a con- 
servative race, assuring 



himself of the championship. 
He finished sixth in a field of 
12, which gave him 45 points 
fortheseason. 

Bob Wente Sr. the feature 
race, leading from start to 
finish. That victory gave him 
41 points on the season, 
which was just 4 points shy of 
USAC Champion Lotshaw. 

Following Lotshaw and 
Wente in the final point 
standings were: Lonnie 
Carthers and Ken Schroder 
who finished with 39 points 
fortheseason. 

Besides the feature race 
there were also four heat 



races. In the first heat race 
Chris Cumberworth was the 
winner. Todd Forbes won the 
second heat race, Other 
opening heat race winners 
were Dick Pole and Don 
Jones. 

A 12-car, 1 5-1 a p consolation 
race was held, and Dick Pole 
again took the checkered 
flag. A total of 43 drivers 
qualified (or the races on 
Sunday. 

Since the 1.1 mile race 
track takes up almost all of 
the Coliseum floor, an 
alternative site had to be 
used for pit areas. All cars 



had their own pit area in the 
Exhibition Hall of the 
Coliseum, which is in the 
basement. The cars were 
brought up to the track via 
the Coliseum freight 
elevator. Once a car finished 
racing it was wheeled down 
(he ramps back to the 
Exhibition Hall. 

Despite the fact that it was 
football's Super Bowl Sun- 
day, many racing fans 
turned out to cheer their 
heroes to victory, and it 
seemed like everyone was 
content sitting in the fume- 
filled Coliseum. 



Officials befriend other team 



Women reaching goals, losing games 



By CHRIS PYLE 
Chief Reporter 

"We let our frustrations 
gel to us." remarked Peggy 
Voisin in reference to IPFW 
women's basketball games 
against division II Valpraiso 
andlUPUI. 

Keeping their momentum 
id the first half, the Tuskers 
battled the ball back and 
forth with host Valpraiso. 
But the opponents gained a 
lead and the trailing Tuskers 
never caught up. Three 
members of IPFW squad 



fouled out and the game 
finished in a 70-54 loss. Coach 
Voisin commented, "we 
didn't do what we needed to 
do." 

Despite the. loss, team 
member Kim Heiman 
played a good game. 
Heimann led the Tusker 
scoreboard by basketing 19 
points. She also contributed 
11 rebounds. 

"I've never seen them play 
that badly," said Voisin 
about the debut against 
IUPUI. According to Voisin, 



the first half was disastrous 
as the Tuskers scored only 9 
points. 

Bad officiating could be 
part of the blame for the loss. 
Unfortunately, the officials 
were friends with the olher 
team. Recalled Voisin, 
"IUPUI played a man to 
man defense. They hung onto 
our jerseys. They (officials) 
missed some obvious colls." 

With the current record 
now standing at 2-10, the 
team is lacking in moral. 
Voisin believes a win is what 



the team needs to perk them 
up. "We need a win," 
remarked Voisin. "It's 
depressing for me as a coach 
as well as it is on the girls. 
But we keep striving. I think 
they'll come around, but it 
will bea joltto them." 

In determining success, 
one can'l just look at the 
team's win-loss record. 
Olher accomplishments and 
goals cannot be overlooked. 
Little by little, the Tuskers 
are able to master some of 
the goals they set. One such

ial that has been reached is 
fewer turnovers. 

Perhaps Ihe seasonal 
record would look better if 
the Tuskers didn't challenge 
teams out of their division. 
By playing teams out of their 
division enables the Tuskers 
to play teams in their own 
division with a bigger grain 
of confidence. Summing it 
up, Voisin said, "Games with 
division II teams ore ify. 
When we play teams in our 
league (division III I, we 
know thai we can beat 



"We lost our patience and 
forced our passes to players 
who were not open. We were 
also intimidated by their 
size," said Workman. 

High scorers for IPFW 
were Gary Bush with 18. 
Gary Rinard with 17, Rickie 
Smith with 17, and Scott 
NorrlswlthlOpoints. 

The Tuskers lost to 
another tall team, (hat being 
lUPU-Indionapolis 90-70. 
Against their 6'8", 6'7" and 
0'5" front line, IPFW hod 
trouble penetrating and 



side 



the 



Indianapolis defense. Four 
Indianapolis players scored 
in double figures. 

IPFW Tailed to recognize 
some good shooting op- 
portunities and as a result, 
fell behind 49-26 at halftime. 
The Tuskers cut their deficit 
down to 12 points with eight 
minutes left to play before 
Indianapolis's size took over 
again. 

Rickie Smith was the high 
scorer for IPFW with 31 
points in a losing cause, 
IPFW ended up shooting 43 
percent for the game. 

The Tuskers were bombed 
by IU Southeast B7-G5. IPFW 
had their work cut out for 



(hem when Gary Hinardand 
Brian Grady got into early 
foul trouble. 

IU Southeast built a 55-38 
halftime lead and proceeded 
to increase their margin 5 to 
29 points as they led Ihe 
Tuskers 71-42 with 14:40 left 
to be played in the game. 

Workman, feeling that the 
game was getting out of 
hand, pulled all of his 
starters except Mike 
Schaefer, who was doing an 
outstanding job on the 
boards with 11 rebounds. 

"We were not mentally in 
the game," said Workman. 

The reserves cut the lead 
to 15 points, but failed to 
keep their opponents from 
penelraling IPFW's defense 
for the higher percentage 
shots. 

Gary Bush was the leading 
scorer for IPFW with 14 
points. Mike Schaefer scored 
12 points while Rickie Smith 
added 12 points. IPFW shot 
45 percent for the game and 
was ou (rebounded 39-31. 

Inconsistency and inex- 
perience continue to plague 
the Tuskers just as they have 
all year long. 

"We haven't learned to go 



hard fur a good pcriod'of 
time, but we work hard and 
we w.inl to win," said Work- 
man. 

Workman added that bis 
team is playing with more 
aggressiveness and also 
praised his reserves for 
contributing more each 
game. 

The Tuskers are now 7-10 
on the year and are hitting 45 
percent of their field goal 
attempts and 67 percent of 
their free throw attempts. 
The Tuskers' opponents have 
bit on 48 percent of their field 
goal attempts. 

IPFW will face another 
toll squad come this Wed- 
nesday al 7:30 p.m. against 
Goshen. After a dismal road 
trip, IPFW is looking for- 
ward to this home game, but 
will have to contend with 
Goshen's two big men who 
are 6'8" and 6'5" respec- 
tively. 

The Tuskers will face their 
city rival, Indiana Tech, at 
home on Saturday at 3 p.m. 
Indiana Tech will be seeking 
revenge from their earlier 
loss to the Tuskers during 
theSertoma Tourney.
