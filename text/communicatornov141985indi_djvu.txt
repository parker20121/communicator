Committee rumors corrected 



M1CHELE SHAFFER 
Managing Editor 

Donald Brown, vice-president for 
Academic Affairs and provost to 
Purdue University, West Lafayette, 
said Nov. 8 that Purdue does not have a 
policy of naming chairmen to search 
committees who are in superior 
positions to the position being filled, to 
his knowledge. 

"I doubt my position is higher (than 
that of chancellor)," said Brown. 
Typically, the chancellor reports to the 
president of a university as does Brown 
in his duties as vice-president and 
provost Brown did say that, as 



chairman of the search and screen 
committee, he was appointed by 
Purdue University President Steven 
Beering. 

The search for a chancellor will be a 
national one, according to Brown. 
Hopefully, a decision on a new chan- 
cellor will be made by July or Sep- 
tember, continued Brown. 

When questioned about the make-up 
of the committee. Brown said he and 
John Huie, executive assistant to 
Beering, are the only people from West 



Lafayette. The membership of the 
committee itself, said Brown, consists 
of all Fort Wayne community people 
and IPFW faculty and staff members. 
Brown added he didn't think the 
committee was one-sided. He also said 
there were several representatives 
from IU missions on the committee. 

Michael Downs, chairman of the 
IPFW Political Science department. 
clarified his position Monday at the 
faculty senate meeting concerning the 
search and screen committee. Downs 



said he relinquished his position on the 
committee because he flel the IPFW 
faculty and theFort Wayne community 
were not recognized properly on the 
committee. 

Downs explained he felt Beering did 
make an error in judgment in his choice 
of Brown for chairman, in his view, but 
said he didn't think it was a damaging 
one. 

"It is important for Beering to 
receive an accurate statement of 
faculty opinion," said Downs. 



Faculty and staff discuss 
characteristics for new chancellor 




ByEARLSMITH 
Chief Reporter 

"Resolved: the chief characteristics 
of the candidates for chancellor of 
IPFW should be ." 

Faculty and staff discussed ways to 
complete this resolution at the IPFW 
chapter meeting of the American 
Association of University Professors. 

About three dozen faculty and staff 
members attended the meeting. 

A composite of the characteristics 



voiced at the meeling indicates the new 
chancellor should be a leader, an 
academic, one who has charisma and 
can be an advocate for the campus in 
the community, is wise, honest, fair, 
courageous, a person with "sub- 
stance," an independent thinker, a good 
manager and chief executive, and a 
person who has a vision of IPFW as an 
independent university. 

"The chancellor needs to be one who 
has a grasp of academic issues and 



could provide academic leadership into 
the 1990's," said Stephen Harroff, 
assistant professor of German. 

Successfully choosing a chancellor 
depends on the university's vision of 
itself "We can't say what the role of the 
chancellor is unless we know what the 
purpose of the university is. If it is 
teaching, the chancellor must be 
sensitive to the needs of the students," 
said Josue Njock-Libii, assistant 
professor of engineering. 



Contempt debated at faculty senate meeting 



By JOHNETTE TOPL1SEK 

Editor-in-chief 

and MICHELE SHAFFER 

Managing Editor 

The majority of the faculty senate 
meeUng Monday was devoted to 
discussion of a proposed resolution to 
cite Edward Nicholson, vice chancellor 
for Academic Affairs, for contempt. 

The senate decided the vice chan- 
cellor for Academic Affairs should 
serve as an ex-officio member of the 
subcommittee on Budgetary Affairs. 
However, Nicholson refused to serve on 
the subcommittee, saying it conflicted 
with his normal duties. 

Steven Hollander, assistant professor 
of English and Linguistics, said the ex- 



officio members do not have normal 
membership responsibilities. Their 
purpose. Hollander continued, is to be 
invited to meetings and be kept in- 
formed 

Hollander also said when he con- 
tacted Nicholson and John Carnaghi, 
vice chancellor of Financial Affairs, 
Carnaghi said he would serve on the 
subcommittee, but Nicholson declined. 

Carnaghi immediately corrected 
Hollander, saying he did not agree to be 
on the committee. Carnaghi said it 
would be inappropriate for him to serve 
because his role would conflict with his 
duties as vice chancellor for Financial 
Affairs. "I can't be a member of that 
group and carry out my duties," 
Carnaghi said. 



It "presents a conflict of interest" for 
both Carnaghi and Nicholson, said 
Nicholson. 

Nicholson- added however he had no 
problem with cooperating with com- 
mittees that solicit appropriate in- 
formation.'it is helpful to have a 
committee to identify budgetary 
needs," said Nicholson. "I would be 
happy to offer my views (to the budget 
subcommittee)." 

Raymond Pipperl, professor of 
mathematics, expressed some con- 
fusion concerning this remark Pippert 
asked if he has willingness to help — 
why is Nicholson not on the list as an ex- 
officio member? 

Maynard Mansfield, chairman of the 



Mathematical Sciences department, 
said in his opinion — and according to 
the bylaws of the senate and Robert's 
Rules of Order — Nicholson and Car- 
naghi should serve as ex-officio 
members- 

In trying to organize some sort of 
compromise, Marc Lipman, associate 
professor of mathematics, opted to 
postpone the matter until the January 
meeting so the subcommittee can 
gather more information on the topic. 
Van Coufoudakis, associate professor 
of political science, agreed, saying the 
seanle has "not exhausted the avenues 
of compromise." 

The senate did table the resolution 
until their January meeting, pending 
more information. 



Mergers of regional campuses compared 



By DEBORAH A. ST ARKS 
Chief Reporter 

The signs of the regional campuses at 
Fort Wayne and Indianapolis may read 
Indiana University- Purdue University, 
but other than sharing the same name, 
there are few similarities between the 
two universities, 

IPFW and IUPU1 are the only two 
regional campuses in the Indiana 
University and Purdue University 
systems which share the same name. 

The regional campuses in the Indiana 
University system are Indiana North 
West, South Bend, East, Kokomo, South 
East, and IUPUI. The regional cam- 
puses in the Purdue system are Purdue 
North Central and Calumet, IPFW may 
soon be added to the list of Purdue 
campuses. 

In 1969, the trustees of IU and Purdue 
approved a merger of all programs and 
facilities in Indianapolis. The primary 
responsibility for management and 
operations was given to Indiana 
University. "The Indiana Legislature 
voted to combine IU and Purdue in 
Indianapolis. IU was given primary 
control of IUPUI because Indiana had 
14 of the 16 schools on campus and 
Purdue only had two- IUPUI was the 
first attempt ever to combine two 
universities, with the exception of 
IPFW and it has never been duplicated 
in any other slate," said Tom Henry, 
director of University Relations at 
IUPUI. 

At IPFW prior to 1975, there were two 
separate divisions, Indiana and Pur- 
due. There were separate offices for 
each university, including accounting 
and admissions. 

"In 1976, the trustee boards of both 
universities agreed to assign each 
university its own divisions. Arts and 
Letters were given to Indiana 
University and the divisions of Science 
and Humanities to Purdue University," 
said John Carnaghi, vice chancellor for 
Financial Affairs at IPFW. Most ad- 
ministrative offices for the two 
universities were then combined into 
one office. 

"Non-academic administrative 
decisions made at u?FW fall under the 
jurisdiction of Purdue University with 
input from Indiana University if

warranted, while academic ad- 
ministrative decisions fall under the 
responsibility of its respective 
schools," said Carnaghi 

Salaries are paid differently at 
IUPUI and IPFW "All faculty 
members, including those professors 
who teach for Purdue University at 
IUPUI, are paid through the Indiana 
University system," said Henry 

"There are 300 permanent faculty 
members at IPFW," noted Carnaghi. 
Professors are paid through the 
divisions in which they teach. "Half are 
paid through The Indiana University 
system and hall are paid through the 
Purdue University system," Carnaghi 
said. "(If the Purdue take-over occurs 
at IPFW) employment will remain the 
same. Professors who teach for IU will 
still receive IU paychecks with medical 
benefits from Blue Cross-Blue Shield. 
Purdue professors will still receive 
Purdue paychecks and benefits from 
Prudential Insurance Company." 

Student admissions and record 
keeping are also done differently at 
both universities. "All students en- 



tering IUPUI are admitted under In- 
diana University," said Richard 
Slocum, registrar at IUPUI. "If they 
are Purdue students, computer tapes 
are sent to Purdue University in West 
Lafayette at the end of each semester. 
These tapes contain information about 
the student's progress." 

"Since Purdue only controls the 
School of Science and the School of 
Engineering Technology at IUPUI, it is 
the responsibility of the deans of those 
two schools to make sure that Purdue 
students meet Purdue's requirement 
for graduation," said Henry. 

Meanwhile. "Students entering 
IPFW are registered in their respective 
divisions of either Indiana University 
or Purdue," said Betty Folkf, assistant 
registrar at IPFW. "If they are Purdue 
students, their official records are kept 
al Purdue. West Lafayette, however, 
students may obtain an unofficial copy 
of their records from the registrar's 
office at IPFW," 

"Student registration will remain the 
same (at IPFW if the Purdue take-over 
Is approved). IU applicants will still 



pay an application fee and Purdue 
students will still pay a graduation 
fee," commented Carnaghi. 

"In early October, the Indiana 
University Board of Trustees voted to 
render control of the IPFW campus to 
Purdue University. President (John) 
Ryan of Indiana University and 
President (Steven) Beering of Purdue 
University had agreed to this move 
prior to the meeting," said Henry. 

"Purdue was chosen to head the 
IPFW campus because Purdue already 
manages the money matters at IPFW. 
It makes sense that the chancellor 
reports to the same person as does the 
person who handles the financial 
matters," Carnaghi said. 

The Purdue trustees will vote to 
render control of IPFW to Purdue 
University, things will continue as 
usual (at IPFW)," he said. "There may 
be changes by IU for its programs and 
Purdue may change some of its 
programs not related to the take-over," 
Carnaghi added. 

Purdue trustees are expected to meet 
tomorrow.

Now is the time for all 
men to uphold ideals 



We applaud Michael Downs, chairman 
of the Political Science department for 
standing up for his principles and 
[elinquishing his position on the search 
and screen committee, 

Downs recently requested thai Purdue 
University President Steven Beering 
excuse him from the committee. 
Beering followed through. 

We feel it was correct morally for 
Downs to relinquish his position. It is 
nice io I mully see someone courageously 
and openly stand up to his ideals, instead 
of cowering to the whims of his 
superiors. Downs is to be commended 
for his deed. 

However, considering there has been 
great concern on the overall balance of 
the search committee between Indiana 
University and Purdue University, what 
would happen if more of the search and 
screen committee members resigned on 
the basis of their ideals? The bottom line 
is that sometimes we all have to do 
things that we would rather not do 
because we do not totally agree with 
what would happen. This may well have 
been one of those cases. 

However, what would happen if 
several very objective members of the 
search and screen committee followed 
Down's path? This would undoubtedly 
offer the opportunity for the search 
committee to become very one-sided. A 
majority of these people could push to 
have a person largely affiliated with 
either Indiana or Purdue nominated as 
chancellor. 

This would be very improper. Downs 
lias stated he does not disagree with the 
make-up of the committee, only 
Beering's choice for chairman. He even 
ventured to call the make-up of the 
committee "excellent." 



The members are pretty evenly 
divided among local Indiana and Purdue 
faculty. There is great potential for the 
committee to be very objective in 
choosing a chancellor. 

Therefore, we of fer the committee the 
following ideas to keep in mind during 
their national search for a chancellor. 



1. Our new chancellor should be 
very student-oriented. He should 
be concerned about recruiting 
more high school students to 
IPFW. This would prevent IPFW, 
the sixth largest university in 
Indiana, from turning into a night 
school and weekend college for 
returning students 

2. The new chancellor should also 
be community-oriented. He should 
be able to place IPFW goals ahead 
of personal and career goals. He 
should be constantly aware of his 
responsibility of promoting IPFW 
in the minds of the community. 

3. Perhaps most important, the 
committee should try to pick a 
candidate who has had no previous 
relations with either university — 
Indiana University or Purdue 
University. That way, this person 
would more than likely be very fair 
to both universities — satiating the 
appetites of officials from both 
universities. 

This would also quell the fear of 
IPFW becoming another Indiana- 
Purdue- Indianapolis, favoring 
Purdue in this case. 

Needless to say, we are calling for the 
search and screen members to maintain 
the most objective frame of mind. IPFW 
would highly benefit from gaining the 
most unbiased candidate with the goals 
of IPFW foremost in his mind.

-Letters to the Editor 



Parking presents huge problem for students 



Slim pickin's for students 
to fulfill requirements 



The harvest of classes sure is bare this 
spring. Just leaf through the schedule 
and see for yourself. The list of classes 
may appear long, but look how many 
times classes, especially level-one 
classes, are repeated. 

The communication department offers 
only 21 different classes. The 
undergraduate English department has 
only 17 different class offerings, to name 
a few. This may not sound too bad, until 
one looks at the level of the classes and 
their conflicting times. 

As is the case almost every semester, 
it is a terrible feeling for a senior to find 
out the two classes needed to complete 
his major are not offered, or worse, they 
are offered at the same time. 

Faculty or administration may tell a 
student this situation was poor planning 
on his part. When conflicting classes 
happen semester after semester, how 
are students supposed to plan ahead 
when they do not know how often classes 



will be repeated, if at all. 

It is hard to place the blame for this 
conflict on any specific faculty, 
administrator or student. What are 
department chairmen supposed to do? A 
general planning session to avoid 
conflicting classes, although a possible 
solution, would be almost impossible to 
achieve. 

A feasible solution might be to publish 
some sort of directory informing 
freshmen how often classes are offered 
so they could plan their schedule 
accordingly. That way, if two classes 
conflict, a student knows one of them 
will be offered again next semester or in 
the near future. 

Although compiling a directory may 
seem like a tedious and complicated 
venture, this would help advisors in 
advising students and students in 
planning their schedule. Think about it 
... wouldn't this solve a lot of problems in 
the long run? 



To ihe Editor: 

More and more students 
are attending IPFW causing 
definite parking shortage. 
Parking in the grass and 
double-parking are 
becoming a major source for 
student parking spaces. The 
awkward parking should be 
enough in itself to gel the 
administration to work on a 
solution to rid us of the 
parking problem. 

There's plenty of field 
space that could be turned 
into parking lots. Also, vans 
could bring students to and 
from campus from various 
parts of the city at fixed 
times each day. Another 
solution would be to build a 
parking garage. A garage 
would most definitely be 
most effective in solving our 
campus parking dilemma. 

Our parking problem 
needs to be solved. It needs 
to be solved soon. Student 
carpooling and the 
elimination of the A parking 
is a start, but we need 
something solid. So how 
about it? Let's get parking! 
Julie Webb 
Psychology Major 



To the Editor; 

Have you ever found 
yourself driving in circles? 
That's what many students 
on this campus do. A real 
panic can be worked up if 
your class is in five minutes 
and no parking space is 
available. 

Will an additional parking 
lot solve the problem? Yes, 
but many would still have to 
walk a great distance. This 
would not satisfy some of us 
What about a parking 
garage? This would be the 
most convenient for the 
campus but the most ex- 
pensive. I think the "Powers 
That Be" for this campus 
should live one day as a 
student then something 
would be done. 

This is a real problem for 
students and teachers You. 
with the purse strings, loosen 
up. Do something! So many 
would benefit. 

DarleneBillman 
Nursing Major 

To the Editor: 

A parking problem exists 
on this campus that I'm sure 



everyone who works or at- 
tends classes here is aware 
of. This is a commuter 
campus, everyone drives. 
How many people are willing 
to took for a solution' There 
may not be a solution for 
every driver, but there can 
be solutions to alleviate the 
problems for the majority. 
Let's use our heads for a 
little bit instead of writing 
two or five dollar parking 
tickets. 

Walking any distance (o 
class can be painful; 
however, we can attack this 
problem in several ways. 
Eliminate A parking 
altogether There are always 
several A spaces between 7 
a.m. and 10 a.m., but 
students who arrive on 
campus at that time must 
park farther away and walk 
right past those open inviting 
A spaces. No one will deny 
that it is equally important 
for teachers, staff, and 
students (o be on time. So let 
us all have equal parking, 
first come, first serve. 

It will not surprise i

someone starts talking about 
a parking garage for the 
school. A multi-level garage 
could eliminate many 
parking hinderances. 
Eliminating parking meters 
would also help. It's rare 
that visitors use all of the 
meters. Students park at 
meters too. No parking 
meters would be a step 
forward. . . 

The campus police cer- 
tainly do their job well and 
should be commended (or 
their service. Please lay 
aside those parking tickets 
acid put our heads together 
instead of our fenders and 
get to work solving the 
parking problem 

Dave Allen 



To the Editor: 

I along with the rest of 
IPFW students and faculty 
are extremely concerned 
with the campus parking 
problem. I find it absurd that 
we must pay for a parking 
space, only lo arrive and find 
there are none. 

One possible solution to 
this problem would be to 
eliminate parking meters 
and tickets There are not 
enough parking spaces now 
for those who have paid their 
parking fee, so they must 
once again pay to park at a 
meter. If they don't put 
money in the meter then 
their alternative will be lo 
pay their ticket. Another 
possible solution may be 
putting in another parking 
lot. If the school does not 
have the funds for this then 
taking out the parking 
meters is the cheapest way 
lo create Ihe parking spaces. 



This is becoming a very 
aggravating problem and it 
sould be taken care of at

unfair 

To the Editor: 

After having spent several 
weeks observing IPFW's 
Student Senate, it has 
become apparent lhal the 
attitude demonstrated by 
Joe Motherwell, Student 
Body President, is not 
shared by all members or the 
Executive Board In his plea 
for student participation in 
SUBOG and Senate, Mr, 
Motherwell stated that 
students would have and 
utilize an active voice in 
policy-making procedures 
whenever possible. Un- 
fortunately counterpart, 
Brad Miller, is not a party to 
this opinion. 

In recent proposed 

legislation, certain student 
organizations went 
unrepresented du. ing policy- 
making procedures directly 
concerning these groups. It 
is unconceivable why this 
look place in light of the fact 
that members of these 
organizations currently 
reside on senate and were 
available during these 
proceedings. 

As a casual observer, it 
would seem necessary that 
Mr. Miller bear in mind his 
obligation lo all student 
organizations and members 
thereof. We have enough 
politicians who claim to 
represent their constituents.

Companies on their honor concerning minorities 



Fair 
employment 

The Administration will 

permit companies to go back 

.to the honor system in hiring 

; or minorities. After that, 

-"dare we dream of integrated 

lunch counters? 

These things take time 
Someday, they hope to let 
Jackie Robinson play for the 
Brooklyn Dodgers. 

That's why Ronnie doesn't 
seem to age— he's turning 
back the clock. 

This is called supply-side 
fair employment. Easing up 
on employers will result in 
equal opportunity. If you 
believe that you'll believe we 
balanced the budget by 
cutting taxes. 

Secret affairs 

The Commission on the 
Bicentennial of the Con- 
stitution has been meeting in 
secrecy. It's not surprising. 
The Constitution was 
classified top secret in 
Washington some time ago. 

For example, Attorney 
General Meese recently 
made a flat out statement 
that most suspects are 
guilty. 1 understand how Mr. 
Meese feels. 1 had that same 
thought" during his con- 
firmation hearings. 

Warren Burger is the 
chairman of this clandestine 
commission and I'm won- 
dering how they'll celebrate 
the bicentennial of the 
Constitution— perhaps by 
going out and buying up all 
the copies of it. 

On Constitution Day they 
should televise a pageant 
featuring famous Americans 
in a dramatic reenactment 
of the taking of their favorite 
amendment— the Fifth. 




Belly-up 



Balanced 
budget? 



Hurray for Professor 
Franko Modigliani, the 
winner of the Nobel Prize for 
economics. Commenting on 



the Gramm-Rudman budget 
plan, the professor uses the 
highly technical term. 
"Mickey Mouse." 

At last, an economist we 
can understand. Modigliani 
didn't get the Nobel Prize for 
that assessment, but he 
should have. 

I'll take "Mickey Mouse" 
over "macro-micro" every 
time. 

Barry Goldwater tells 
about Senators Gramm and 
Rudman knocking on his 
door saying, "Trick or 
Treat." Goldwater said, 
"what's the treat?" They 
said, "We're going to 
balance the budget by 1991." 
"What's the trick?" asked 
Goldwater. They answered, 
"We just told you." 

Royal 
shopping 

The monarchy isn't what it 
used to be Prince Charles 
and Lady Diana visited a 
J.C. Penney store in the 
suburbs during their visit to 
Washington. You just can't 
get good plastic shower 
curtains in England. 

I have suspected that 
Charles and Diana actually 
enjoy something as mundane 
as a suburban shopping 
mall. I'll bet behind all the 
royalty is a couple whose 
level of excitement probably 
centers around shelf paper. 

Naturally, the media 



asked them all kinds of 
stupid questions But I would 
like to know how Charles and 
Diana feel about raising 
children when neither parent 
is gainfully employed. 

Wouldn't it have been fun 
to ask them— "Your Royal 
Highnesses, for that stub- 
born dirt and grime in the 
kids' laundry, do you use a 
bleach with your regular 
detergent?" 

Or, "Tell me, Prince 
Charles— have you seen 
'Porky's II'?" 



It's that time of year again 
when the government teeters 
on collapse as Congress 
fumbles over the debt 
ceiling. If this were football, 
Congress would be the 
Buffalo Bills. 

On second thought, think of 
it as the Chicago Fire— if the 
government were Mrs. 
O'Leary's barn, Congress 
would be the cow. 

So, the government has to 
dip into the Social Security 
trust fund lo meet its payroll. 
I can see them sneaking into 
the Treasury late at 
night— and ther's old Claude 
Pepper with a shotgun 
saying, "Put that back!" 

The British were present 
at the birth of our govern- 
ment, so it's fitting that 
Charles and Diana were here 
as the government goes 
belly-up. Maybe we should 
give (hem back the tea. 

Russians fair? 

You can tell the summit is 
approaching. After six years 



in exile Russian dissident 
Andrei Sakharov was 
allowed one phone call from 
his relatives. Next, the 
authorities will plant tulips 
around the forced labor 
camps. 

Gorbachev was in- 
terviewed by Time Magazine 
and Americans read the 
complete, unedited tran- 
script. Then Reagan was 
interviewed by Izvestia, 
and Russians read the 
complete, unedited tran- 
script— of Gorbachev's Time 
interview 

A Russian sailor jumps 
overboard and we sent him 
back lo his ship So, he jumps 
overboardagainandwesend 
him back once more. A 
spokesman said, "There's 
always that terrible doubt." 

President Reagan said he 
is optimistic about the 
summit bringing peace and 
tranquility in our time. A 
reporter said, "Between us 
and the Russians?" Reagan 
said, "No— between George 



Shultz and Caspar Wein- 
berger." 



Don't 
quote him 



It's 






reelection when he said, 
"You ain't seen nothing 
yet," By golly— he was right. 

Tax reform? Nothing yet. 
Toxic waste cleanup? Ditto. 
Promising nothing is one 
thing— but the man delivers. 

Press Secretary Larry 
Speakes said the President's 
statement to Izvestia on Star 
Wars was an "Imprecision." 
Apparently "Imprecision" 
replaces "misstatement" 
and the old "inoperative." 
Then, there's the more 
scholarly "bean curd." 

Speakes jumped on 
reporters when they quoted 
the President accurately. So, 
shape up, guys — don't print 
what he said. Print what he 
meant.

Fine Arts funding sought from State Legislature 



By EARL SMITH 

Clilel K* porter 

Acting Chancellor Edward 
Nicholson told (he (acuity 
Senate Monday IPFW will 
not join with the Fort Wayne 
Pine Arts Foundation to 
raise the remaining capital 
needed to build a new fine 
arts facility. The an- 
nouncement came ap- 
proximately one week after 
the tentative deadline which 
the Foundation had set. 

"Considering the feelings 
of the two Presidents (of 
Purdue and Indiana), the 
(acuity, and the students, we 
have decided to go to the 
slate legislature and seek the 
additional $2.25 million," 
said John Carnaghi, Vice- 



While officials are still 
open to private funding to 
match that which has been 
appropriated, they have 
found no one willing to 
provide the funding without 
restrictions, said Carnaghi. 

Depending on the 

legislative leadership, full 
funding may not be obtained 
during this session. "We are, 
in a sense, gambling on bow 
soon we can get funding," 
said Carnaghi. 

Former student body 
president Tom Harris, (ine 
arts student Polly Dean, and 
John Ulmer, student ser- 



vices dean, recently at- 
tended a meeting with 
northeast Indiana state 
legislators. The meeting, 
held at the Chamber of 
Commerce, gave citizens an 
opportunity lo speak on 
issues of concern to them. 



Harris addressed the 
legislators to gain their 
support (or (ull funding of a 
Tine arts building on campus 
during the coming short 
session o( the legislature. 

Whether or not the current 
fine arts facilities are un- 
safe, they have required 
considerable maintenance 
recently. "The state is 
dumping taxpayers' dollars 
into upkeep just to buy 



time," said Harris He (eels 
the money could be much 
better spent than on main- 
taining outdated buildings 
Nobody is saying IPFW 
has a good chance to obtain 
funding during the short 
session, perhaps because 
budget items are rarely 
discussed, Dean told the 
Student Senate. However, 
the chances of getting fund- 
ing during the coming 
session are probably no 
worse than they were at the 
start of last year's session, 
she continued. 

Ulmer left the legislator's 
meeting with the feeling 
added funding would come 
either during this session of 
the legislature or next. "All 
the legislators are very 



supportive of our desire to 
have the slate completely 
(und the fine arts building on 
campus," said Ulmer. 

Harris said a fine arts 
building on campus would 
eliminate many problems 
which students currently 
face at the downtown 
location such as class 
scheduling, night-lime 
safety, and parking. 

A campus fine arts 
building would do much to 
improve the university at- 
mosphere, said Harris. 
"How many students during 
the next 20 years would miss 
the opportunity to take fine 
arts courses if a fine arts 
building were not on cam- 
pus?" asked Harris

Having trouble getting 
across campus lately? Or 
parking in the lot next to the 
Classroom &amp; Medical 
Building? Construction 
started this month on the 
new Animal Care Facility, 
and the work has tied up 
sidewalks and parking lots 
on the southeast side ol 
campus 

The facility, which is being 
built by Robert Crosby and 
Associates, is situated on the 
campus lawn between 
Kettler Hall and the 
Classroom &amp; Medical 
Building. "New sidewalks 
will be built to accommodate 
traffic." said Donald R. 
Katter, director of the IPFW 
Physical Plant, about the 
disruption on campus. 

The facility, which will 
cost an estimated Si million 
to build, will be a one-story 
building with a penthouse for 
storage and housing o( 
mechanical equipment. It 
will cover approximately 
9,000 square (eet. 

Construction began last 
week with the installation of 
the sewer line in the southern 
half of parking lot 11 near the 
Classroom &amp; Medical 
Building. From there. 
builders will construct a slab 
Door for the facility which 
will not have a basement 
floor. 

Construction is expected to 
be completed by July, 1986.

University police crack down on speeders 



University police have 
intensified (heir walch for 
speeders on campus. 

Drivers are violating [he 
speed limit and failing to 
stop at slop signs says police 
chief Larry Gaff. "We have 
had several complaints from 
faculty, staff, and students," 
Gaff said He sees this as an 
increasing problem with the 
approach of bad weather. 



which creates poor visibility 
and slick streets. 

"We're going to be issuing 
more tickets," said Gaff. 
"I'm asking people to please 
slow down and stop at the 
stop signs." he said. 

In the past, the university 
police have issued' an 
average of 10-1S tickets per 
week for moving violations, 
says Gaff. The tickets may 



be either a uniform traffic 
ticket, which is the same as 
those issued by the city 
police and may carry a Tine 
of around $90; or a campus 
ticket, which demands a $10 
fine. The police officer 
decides which type of ticket 
to issue depending on the 
seriousness of the violation. 
The speed limit on campus 



is 20 m.p.h. except for 
Broyles Boulevard from 
East Campus Drive to St. 
Joe Road, where it is 30 
m.p.h. 

Gaff suggested people may 
save lime and avoid the 
congestion at the Coliseum 
Boulevard exit during the 
heavy traffic hours of noon 
and 7:30 p.m. by using the 



exits onto Crescent Avenue 
or St. Joe Road. 

Parking is also a concern 
for Gaff. In the gravel 
parking lot, cars must park 
at the cement parking blocks 
or be ticketed. The paved 
portion of this lot is for 
turning around only - no 
parking is allowed there 
according to Gaff 



Ft. Wayne man sells protection devices: 
stun guns, body armour, chemical weapons 



If you would like to have 
the hidden edge in a violent 
confrontation, a local man 
says he can give it to you. 

Gary Martin, president of 
Your Hidden Edge, Inc. sells 
personal protection aids 
from his home on Lahmeyer 
Road 

Martin, a former police 
reserve officer, started his 
business of selling protective 
vests about a year ago. 
Because of his interest in 
weapons and self defense, 
hi* product line continues to 
grow. He sells body armour, 
chemical weapons, stun 
devices and assorted police 
equipment. "Any weapon 



has 



distinct ad- 
vantages and disad- 
vantages," said Martin. 

Martin favors a chemical 
weapon for self defense 

inside the home because it 



can put a lot of distance 
between you and the at- 
tacker. The proper way to 
use a chemical weapon, such 
as a tear gas aerosol spray, 
is to spray it behind you al 
your attacker as you are 
running away, he explains. A 
large police canister of tear 
gas has a 12-15 foot range. 
"Clearly in a situation with 
no wind the chemical 
weapons have an advantage 
because they keep the person 
at bay," said Martin. Martin 
does nol recommend a 
chemical weapon for use 
outside because the wind 
may blow the chemical back 
in your face. 



"My personal recom- 
mendation to people who 
want to use a non-lethal 
weapon for self defense 
outside the home is the 
XR5000 stun device," said 



Martin. "It is an effective, 
safe alternative for self 
protection." 

The Nova XR50OO is a 
small; hand-held device 
powered by a nickel cad- 
mium rechargeable battery. 
There are two small probes 
extending from' the front 
approximately two inches 
apart. The probes are meant 
to be pressed against an 
attacker's body so that an 
electrical shock can be 
delivered. Contact of zero to 
one seconds repels the at- 
tacker, one to two seconds 
will cause the person to drop 
to their knees, and contact of 
two to five seconds will keep 
a person down for one to 20 
minutes, according to 
Martin. 

When activated, 47.000 
volts of electricity come out 
through one probe, then 6,000 



volts penetrate through the 
skin and arch underneath to 
the other probe, says Martin. 
The device produces a short 
period of incapacitation 
when the entire voluntary 
muscle system is shut down 
by the brain, says Martin. 
But he claims there is ab- 
solutely no danger of per- 
manent injury unless the 
device is applied to the 
eyeball. 



Allen County police have 
38 officers who are certified 
to use a stun device. "The 
officers can carry one if they 
choose to do so," said deply 
chief Chris Burns. "Al times 
it can be a useful weapon." 
Both Burns and Martin 
agree a stun device should 
not be used in a situation 
where the attacker is armed. 
Training is important. 



Martin, whose background 
includes two years as a 
karate instructor and seven 
years teaching CPR for the 
American Red Cross, is an 
authorized civilian in- 
structor for the stun device. 
He plans to start classes soon 
and counselors from the Fort 
Wayne Women's Bureau 
Rape Awareness Program 
will be some of his first 
students "We'll offer it to 
the counselors if they want 
it," said Jeanne Harber 
Porter, director of RAP 
Porter feels it is valuable to 
know about all the options 
available for self protection. 
Someone from RAP will then 
participate in Martin's 
civilian training classes by 
providing information to 
class members about rape 
awareness and prevention 




it if you're thinking about spef ding across campus lo get to class o 
cracking down on moving violations (pholoby Mark New). 



Pre-retirement planning will ease anxious and frustrated feelings 



By BARBARA HILL 

Associate Professor of Nursing 

and EVELYN WATERS 

Assistant Professor of Consumer and Family Sciences 

, 1. What is Pre-Retirement Planning? 

2. Why make use of Pre-Retirement Planning? 

Remember the last time you had drop-in company? The 
visitors might have been friends you dearly loved and ones 
you bad been looking forward to having visit sometime. But 
they got to your home before you were actually ready for 
them. 

You thought as you invited them in that you wished you had 
more time to prepare. You felt anxious and frustrated and 
perhaps even a little bit angry. Lack of pre-retirement 
planning sometimes makes people feel the same way when 
the day comes to retire. Pre-retirement planning is 
preparing for health, lifestyle, and income in retirement al f&gt;u 
or 55 when most of us still have the energy and desire to 
choose from available options Pre-retirement planning 
allows an employee to make retirement a planned guest 



rather than a surprise caller. 

Some companies have begun helping individuals plan for 
retirement in the broadest sense because of mutual benefits 
to the company and employees. For example, the company 
derives a positive public relations image and, in addition, 
may solve retrenchment problems ,by offering desirable 
alternative to employment "till mandatory retirement. 
Employees derive satisfaction from knowing options and 
exercising power of choice which in turn enhances individual 
dignity and self worth. 

One company, GTE-MTO, has developed a comprehensive 
and ongoing pre-retirement planning program for all em- 
ployees who are technically eligible to retire (combination of 
55 years of age and x years of service). Two day seminars 
focus on lifestyle planning, financial planning (company 
benefits, estimatiung retirement income and expenses, in- 
flation and basic investment options), health, inter-personal 
relations and leisure options. The content for the highly 
coveted seminars was selected as a result of initial survey 



responses from retirees and from responses made by em- 
ployees in the target group on a later survey. 

Crucial to the success of any pre-retirement program is the 
development of an awareness of options with in the em- 
ployment setting. GTE-MTO questionnaires focused on 
cognitive behavioral and attitudinal readiness to retire. 
Specific content areas addressed within each focus were 
financial planning, health promotion activities, retirement 
policies, and leisure-work options. Readiness Indexes were 
assigned, which facilitated the development of a com- 
prehensive plan to prepare employees for a major life event 
change 

The Readiness Index, which was established also provided 
administrators the information they needed to develop 
ongoing, two-way written and verbal communication with 
prospective retirees (present employees) aimed at 
alleviation of many of the frustrations associated with 
retirement. 

Some faculty and staff are eager lo explore the possible 



options available to them now hoping to increase their own 
readiness index and eliminate the hazards of "drop in 
company." The following questions are gleaned from the 
GTE-MTO survey: 

I know my blood pressure and pulse rale and understand 
what the information says about my health. 

Job pressures now bother me more than they used to. 

I have become familiar with the 1PFW retirement benefit 



Congratulations! You have taken the first slep toward 
increasing your awareness level of pre-retirement planning 
needs. What should you do next? Take action ; commit today. 
You may have received a preference survey from Linda 
Goeble regarding some possible meetings in Spring Semester 
sponsored by the Personnel Department 

If you have not already responded positively to her request. 
do so today without delay Also mark your January calendars 
to join Evelyn Waters and Barb Hill for a brown bag lunch, 
film and discussion to collectively increase our own 
readiness indexes lor identifying and choosing options.

Tri-State Honor Band young stars of the evening 



by SEBASTIAN CHAPMAN 

Staff Writer 

While parents, friends, band directors and music lovers or 

all ages crowded into the Neff Recital Hall, the young stars of 

the evening were hurriedly making last-minute preparations 

for their debut. 

The Tri-State Honor Band members cautiously tuned their 
instruments to insure the finest tone quality, while an- 
ticipating the arrival of their director. Anxious expressions 
and several cases of the jitters were apparent as they 
casually strolled about the room constantly insuring each 
other "we're going to play good." 

The band is composed of "60 of the better" high school 
students from Northern Indiana. Under the direction of Dr. 
George Cavanaugh, IPFW coordinator of music education, 
the students performed Overture in B-flat and several 
selections from "A Chorus Line," among other tunes. 

The Overture was performed briskly. Mixing a pattern of 
crescendos and decrescendos, it revealed a variety of 
techniques the students were drilled in for the evening's 
performance 



Prior to being selected for the band, each student was 

auditioned on his or her instrument. "Eighty-five students in 
all were auditioned, but we could only accept 60 of them," 
said Dr. Cavanaugh. "I wish we could have given everyone 
who auditioned the opportunity to play in a band of this 
caliber. It's a great ex pereicne for high school kids." 

The students themselves were eager to express their 
thoughts. "I think this band is better than any I've played in 
before," said Doug McKee, a Manchester High School junior 
who plays trumpet in the band. McKee (hen added he was 
"Fortunate" to have been selected since more than 20 high 
schools sent representatives to the try-outs. 

During the concert, the IPFW saxophone quartet exhibited 
their skills in performing the Andante et Scherzo, for which 
they received a gracious round of applause. This piece 
marked the end of the concert's first half. 

After a brief intermission, the parents of the band mem- 
bers were recognized by Dr. Ator, music chairman and the 
second half of the concert was underway. It was introduced 
by the invigorating sounds of "A Chorus Line." 

Strange as it may seem, the band didn't know which pieces 



wouldbe performed until two days prior to the concert. Each. 
student was issued a folder containing various selections of 
basic concert band literature. 

Every piece in the folder had been practiced by the 
students, but the exact music to be performed were a 
mystery to all except Dr. Cavanaugh. "We've put together a 
real good band. We expect a lot from the kids, but we should. 
They're the best from 20 different high schools," Said Dr.' 
Vacanaugh. 

The students devoted a great deal of time to their Saturday 1 J 
evening performance. Rehearsal was held Friday night and ' 
all day Saturday, but it was definitely worth it. In fact, "it 
was great," many of the students said. The freshmen and 
sophomore members of the band particularly expressed an 
interest in being in the band next year. 

After the band's third selection ended, Dr, Cavanaugh; 
informally introduced the participating high school directors: 
who were in attendance. He then walked back to his podium, 
summoned his pupils to attention and with an upward motion 1 
of his arms the band began its final selection, Stars and 
Stripes Forever.

This new comic strip, 
"Heartland" was conceived 
by our own illustrator, Mike 



He's currently enrolled in 
11 credit hours of com- 
mercial art classes, "since 
you can't get a degree in

Linville is responsible for 
the innovative and pithy 



editorial cartoons in The

beginning of this semester. 

"I've had an idea for a 
comic strip (or about 10 
years now. I've fiddled 
around with different things 



— here it is. We'll see what 
happens." 

Some of his experience 
locally includes his work at 
the Kendalville News-Sun. 
Linville's responsibilities 
included being the staff 
arl,ist and working on the 



advertising layouts. 

He provided much the 
same services for the 
Auburn Evening Star. 

One of Linville's goals is to 
be a syndicated cartoonist, 
using Garry Trudeau as an 
example. 



"Trudeau started in the 
Yale paper and look what 
happened to him!" Linville 
sees his artwork as an ex- 
tension of his writing. So. 
watch this space and see how 
people in the Heartland 
really live!

University Singers 



Bv GARY LACY 

Stair Writer 

The University Singers of 
IPFW delivered a powerful 
performance at a special 
memorial concert last 
Sunday. The audience 
showed their appreciation 
with a huge round of ap- 
plause at the end. 

John Loessi, the con- 
ductor, dedicated the con- 
cert to the memory of 
Dorothy Whitney, who was 
actively involved as a 
secretary in the music 
division at IPFW. She had 
been ill with cancer for 
several months, and left her 
secretarial job last spring. 

The opening of the concert 
greeted the crowd with "Ubi 
Caritas," a number which 
speaks of loveand charity, to 



shift the audience to a more 
positive mood. The concert 
continued with selections 
from 1500-1700, and followed 
with "Reincarnations." 
■Reincarnations" was 
created when Samuel 
Barber took three popular 
poems from the early 1900s 
and gathered the basic 
meaning from them, then set 
them to music. 

These three poems, "'Mary 
Hynes," "Anthony O'Daly," 
and "The Coolin" were 
performed by the singers, 

No cameras or recording 
devices were allowed at the 
concert, which lasted 
slightly over a half an hour. 
The audience found the 
concert entertaining and 
exciting, judging by the 
enthusiastic response.

Mastodons to compete in GLVC tourney 



By JENNY BLAKLEY 
Sports Editor 

The Multipurpose Building 
was the scene of the last 
regular season matches for 
Ihe IPFW women's 
volleyball team. The 
Mastodons fared well in their 
IPFW Classic tournament 
this past Friday and 
Saturday, routing all three of 
their opponents. They first 
defeated tough opponent 
Northern Kentucky 15-8, 15- 
5, and 17-15. They then 
whipped Ashland 15-0, \bA 
and 1S-6. In their third 
match, they outscored 
Valporaiso 15-6, 15-4 and 15- 
11. They built an impressive 
season record of 23-11. The 
team also achieved a 
regional ranking of fifth for 
the regular season. Ferris 
State has a number one 
ranking, followed by second- 
place Grand Valley, North- 
em Michigan in third 
place, and Wright State, 
finishing the regular season 
in the fourth position in the 
region. 



The volleyballers are 
looking to this weekend, 
when they will participate in 
the Great Lakes Valley 
Conference (GLVC) 
championship. The 
Mastodons are favored to 



win the tournament, seeded 
number one in the North 
Division. Obviously, Head 
Coach Amie Ball is op- 
timistic about the team's 
performance this weekend at 
Ashland. "We are continuing 
to improve and the op- 
portunity to win (the tour- 
nament) is very good,'' Ball 
says. "We've beaten all of 
the teams in the conference 
at least once. Northern 
Kentucky will be our major 
obstacle, if we get that far." 

Northern Kentucky is 

seeded first in the South 
Division. 

Balls sees several factors 
that will probably affect the 
team's performance. "We 
have won 14 in a row. There 
is a gradual and continual 
improvement, both 
physically and mentally. 
There is no reason why it 
won't continue through next 
week," Ball says. 

The team's age could also 
be an important agent. Ball 
says, "We are a young 
group, and that has hurt the 
team. But we've overcome 
that." He adds. "They have 
really matured in the last 
five to six weeks." 

Several teams have a 
chance of providing the Lady 

Mastodons with some dif- 



ficult competition, such as 
Northern Kentucky, as 
previously stated, as well as 
Saint Joseph, Bellarmine 
and Southern Indiana. "We 
are the defending conference 
champions, and everyone 
will be trying to knock us 
out," Ball comments. 

Indiana Central will be 
fPFW's first opponent on 
Friday, The number one 
seeded Mastodons will take 
on Indiana Central at 6 p.m. 
at Ashland. The winner of 
that match will play the 
victor of the Saint Joseph- 
Bellarmine contest on 
Saturday, 12 noon. Kentucky 
Wesleyan and Lewis play on 
Friday as well, and the 
winner of that match will go 
against Northern Kentucky . 
Ashland and Sou then In- 
diana go at it Friday also, 
the winners of those matches 
in the South Division playing 
for the semi-finals on 
Saturday. The finals for the 
championship will be held at 
4:00 on Saturday, pitting the 
best teams from the North 
Division and South Division. 
All of these matches will be 
the best out of five 'games.) 

Other matches will be held 
for the third through the 
seventh place positions. 
Those will be a best of three 
(game) matches.

Assistants find many rewards in coaching 



By JENNY BLAKLEY 
Sports Editor 

To have a good team. 
much more is needed than 
the athletes under the 
direction of the head coach 
Behind a winning learn lies 
not only these elements, bul 
others, including the 
assistant coaches The job of 
directing a team would be a 
difficult task without the aid 
of assistant coaches, such as 
Lisa Sheehan, Mark Cook 
and Rhonda Unverferth. 

Sheehan is an assistant to 
Arnie Ball, the head coach of 
IPFW's women's volleyball 
team. Sheehan had played 
volleyballfor the Mastodons, 
and says her interest in 
coaching evolved from that. 
"I became involved with the 
athletes on the team (which 



produced her interest in 
coaching)," Sheehan 
comments. 

Sheehan is the defensive 
assistant coach, and several 
duties fall under that title. "I 
watch the team, and make 
sure they are doing well on 
defense," Sheehan says. "I 
throw the volleyballs in for 
the team (as a part of 
practice). I also keep the 
stats for the team (during 
their matches). " 

Another assistant coach is 
Mark Cook, the assistant to 
men's basketball coach Tim 
Russell. Cook also aids the 
team in several different 
aspects. "I see if the players 
are doing something wrong, 
and help them," Cook says. 
"I help them in their drills." 
Cook played for the 



Mastodons basketball team 
for three years, and is a fifth 
year senior, majoring in 
supervision. He explains, 
"I'm kind of like a graduate 
assistant," and is helping out 
the team while obtaining his 
bachelor's degree. 

Rhonda Unverferth is an 
assistant to Julie Callahan, 
the women's basketball 
coach at fPFW. Unverferth, 
a fifth year student majoring 
in elementary education, 
also played basketball for 
LPFW, and found it difficult 
to stay away from the game. 
"I wasn't ready to give up 
the game," Unverferth 
comments. "Coaching is the 
next best thing to playing " 



Unverferlh's job includes 
various tasks as well. "I 
scout for the team, and I help 
out on the drills," Un- 
verferth says. "I 'mix it up' 
for the girls (to assist them 
in their practice). I also 
practice sometimes with the 
team." 

Sheehan's future plans 
include a possible head 
coachingjobinvolleyball. "I 
don't know if I want to coach 
at the junior high or high 
school level yet." 

Unverferth also hopes to 
continue her coaching 
career. She comments, "I 
want to teach and coach in 
Ohio," where she is from. 

The coaches find various 



rewards in coaching. Cook 
says, "I like the players, and 
enjoy being next to the game 
again." 

"I like seeing them 
working hard and doing the 
best they can," Unverferth 
comments. 

Sheehan also enjoys the 
personal aspect of the job "1 
enjoy working with the 
people, and seeing their- 
progress It's really neat to 
help someone and hear them 
say, Thanks for doing this 
for me."' 

(Editor's Note: Assistant 
coaches were selected 
totally at random to avoid 
favoritism.
