Education faces gender 
discrimination charges 



Campus organizations come through 
for Fort Wayne community families 



By Dodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 



By Nol Beckley 

Editor 

A former assistant professor of 
education has filed a gender dis- 
crimination charge in federal court 
in Indianapolis against the universi- 
ty on Oct. 20. 

Edlyn Jones said she was 
informed she would not be reap- 
pointed as an assistant professor for 
the 1997-1998 school year even 
(bough her complaint said her "cre- 
dentials to support reappointment 
and continuation toward tenure at 
IPFW are the same or similar to 
those of male colleagues in the 
School of Education at the time of 
their tenure and promotion," 

After Jones' non-reappoinl- 
meni, the 1U faculty board of 
review recommended Jones be 
reappointed for the 1997-1999 
school years. She would also have a 
year-long probationary period end- 
ing in 1998. 

The board also found nepotism 
played a part in the decision nol to 
reappoint Jones. The board said 
they thought is was inappropriate 
for Dean of Education Betty Steffy 
to reconsider Jones' non-reappotni- 



rrii.ni because she is married to 
Fenwick English, vice chancellor 
of academic affairs and former 
Dean of Education. 

"Our concern about the nepo- 
tism issue is reinforced by evidence 
which suggests that Dean Steffy did 
nol have sufficient materials avail- 
able on which to base her reconsid- 
eration of Professor Jones' non- 
reappointment." the board found 

Jones was terminated from the 
university despite a recommenda- 
tion by the faculty board of review 
to reappoint her and also despite the 
board's finding that IPFW violated 
IU, IPFW and school of education 
rules, policies and procedures by 
unfairly terminating her from the 
university. 

Jones' attorney, Michael K 
Bonnell. said the university acted 
indifferently during the faculty 
board of review hearing. 

Two administrators didn't show 
up to lb e bearing and documents 
requested from the administration by

Volunteensm has been in the news a lot since 
a national call was made to American citizens to 
assume responsibility for helping someone. 

Two campus organizations have taken it 
upon themselves to address needs that have been 
observed by their members The Black Collegian 
Caucus and Hispanos Unidos have decided to 
give back to the community in a most direct 
manner 

It is not as if the Black Collegian Caucus 
(BCC) has allowed die holidays to come and go 
and without acknowledging those in need 

It is just that this year the group has decided 
to do more. In previous years, the BCC has gone 
to pediatric wards of local hospitals and made the 
holidays a little brighter for sick children by 
singing and distributing candy canes. 

This year the group has added to its reper- 
toire of charitable acts. 

The plan is to collect a variety of donations 
to be given lo Second Chance Homeless Shelter, 
a relatively new facility Second Chance has been 
in existence for two years and provides services 
for homeless women and their children. 

In fact, the shelter started out as a daycare for 
homeless children. The shelter's founders saw a 
different need thai desperately needed to be met: 
another shelter for women. 

Before Second Chance opened, there was 
only one other shelter. Charts House, which is the 
Women's Division of the Fort Wayne Rescue 
Mission. The director of Second Chance, Clydia 



Early, feels that college students becoming 
involved with the shelter can have positive 
effects. 

"I think that as a college organization it has 
been tremendous." said Early. "1 wish more 
groups would get involved. Residents need to see 
more people from the educational realm." 

In addition to giving residents a place to stay. 
Second Chance offers residents jobs and job 
training by working with temporary labor agen- 
cies, and through community resources 

The shelter staff also helps the residents get 
low-income bousing. This year's donation drive 
is nol the first time the Black Collegian Caucus 
and Second Chance have come together in an 
effort to assist the shelter 

During the Three Rivers Festival, the two 
entities had a booth in an effort to raise money 
Early thinks it would be possible for the groups 
to collaborate again. 

Black Collegian Caucus President Lynelle 
Lewis is also pleased to help Second Chance. 

"We want to give back in a way that is more 
direct We want to see our efforts really help out 
the Black community " 

The group plans to donaic a plethora of trav- 
el-sized items that the residents can easUy take 
with them as they are discharged from Second 
Chance. Children's items are needed as well. 

Second Chance will take any donation. 
Individuals need to call the shelter at 426-3120 
for more specific instructions for donating 

Hispanos Unidos President Palermo Galindo 
is confident this year's effort to help a family in 
need will be as successful as last year's. 

Last year the group adopted a family that 
consisted of a single mother and her five chil- 



dren. The families are usually selected from 
Catholic Charities or from another agency that 
have families that have not been selected by a 
corporation or individual. 

The families the group has selected this year 
include several children from preschool to early 
teen years and a single mother 

The needs for the families arc the same: win- 
ter clothing and perhaps a toy for the small chil- 
dren. 

The families receive gift certificates from 
WAJI's Make-A-Wish List for edible items. 

The goal of Hispanos Unidos is to help fam- 
ilies, regardless of background, who are in need. 

The group would also appreciate it if those 
outside of the group became involved. 

Galindo would like for more people to join 
the group or donate. 

In order to get more people involved, the 
group is hosting a Holiday Fiesta on Saturday at 
9 p.m. 

This is held at the Cambridge Square II 
Clubhouse. 7600 Cold Springs Blvd., across 
from Northrop High School on Cook Rd. 

Pcople who attend the party must bring a 
donation The group will also have collection 
barrels in the Classroom-Medical Lounge, and in 
the basement of Kettler Hall. 

Galindo has some very specific goals for his 
organization. 

"One of my main goals as president is to 
have the group reach out to the community and 
let the community know that we are not too busy 
to help," said Galindo, "The other is to have stu- 
dents from different backgrounds join Hispanos 
Unidos."

Staff Editorial 



Truth often hurts, but 
still must be told 



Asjoumalists, we pride ourselves 
on our ethical prowess and journal- 
istic integrity. We have learned, 
through time, to develop a "thick 
skin" with regards to what we write 
and prim It's a fact that not every 
reader will like every slory. Thus, 
we can take jihes attacking the qual- 
ity of the information thai we pnnt. 
We can also take barbs that question 
our choice of news. That's part of 
life as a journalist 

As a result, we have learned to 
stand Turn for what we believe is 
important news that you, the com- 
munity, have the right 10 know. Most 
of the time, we are lucky enough to 
bring you news that is hopeful and 
positive. Sometimes, however, what 
you need most to know — the things 
thai will impact you the most — 
aren't pleasant to read. But they still 
deserve a voice You deserve to bear 
both the good and the bad. 
Lately, Tbe 



Communicator 
has been taking 
a lot of heat for 
our coverage 
about the 
rumors and alle- 
gations sur- 
rounding 
Chancellor 
Michael 
Wartell's proto- 
col (or lack 
thereof). We've 
been both laud- 



alleged "consequences " These con- 
sequences involve the loss of fund- 
ing and an alleged "enemy list" sup- 
posedly held by the chancellor. 

We've been told by our detractors 
thai we're blowing things out of pro- 
portion and thai this will all go away 
really soon. Unfortunately, this will 
not go away quickly 

Anything that makes instructors 
and employees uncomfortable and 
nervous on this campus affects the 
students in some way, shape or form 
If our insiruciors are being threat- 
ened inio compliance, lest their bud- 
gets shrivel, who's really losing 
here? The answer everyone. 

Things that happen a( IPFW don't 
just affect the students and staff — 
they affect every citizen who is pay- 
ing taxes on this property and its 
buildings, every person who attends 
a campus event, every generous man 
or woman who donates money lo

Obviously, 
we've hii a nerve in the community 

We've been accused of, among 
other things, carrying out a "cru- 
sade" to destroy the chancellor and 
his professional reputation. Our edi- 
tor has been personally attacked in 
editorial tellers in The Journal 
Gazette and The News-Sentinel; he 
was called "irresponsible" in one 
and "sensation- seeking" in another 
It has also been rumored that our 
editor is spear-heading this attack in 
retaliation for a situation that 
occurred (some time ago) where the 
chancellor tned to remove him from 
bis position. That's an untrue and 
unfair assumption that is being made 
about our editorial policies. 

It came to our attention that a 
tense atmosphere has been created 
on this campus— one where many 
members of the faculty are afraid to 
speak ibeir minds, for fear of certain

also fully aware

our actions are 

creating. However, we are also 

tuition- and lax- paying adults, and 

as such, we have a say in what 

occurs here 

Something is occurring on this 
campus thai is disturbing the people 
with whom we have entrusted our 
educations. These people give us 
knowledge and the skills (0 make a 
future They give so much of them- 
selves, often thanklessly. We have 
taken it upon ourselves to get to the 
irutfa, to give something to them for 
once. 

This is NOT a witch-huni; we 
have given ihe chancellor opportuni- 
ty upon opportunity to talk with us 
about the allegations, bul he has 
refused. 

We simply wanl an explanation 
and corrective action before our aca-

Round 
about = 
disaster 

To THE editor: 

I have attended IPFW for a year 
now. 1 have enjoyed everything 
about the campus, excepi for ihe 
turn-about. This newest addition is 
a real problem. 1 travel the turn- 
about on a daily basis and il is a 
hazard. The drivers have no respect 
for the yield signs. This could end 
up being a huge disaster in the win- 
ter months. The drivers shool in 
from four directions with no respect 
for someone going around at the 
same time. The turn-about has iwo 
lanes but I find them lo be very 
ineffeciive. The one lane is for dri- 
vers circling and (he other is for dri- 
vers wanting to exit one of ihe four 
directions 

I'm noi exacdy sure whai a 
good alternative would be but I find 
this addition could end up being a 
problem in ihe future. The lack of 
drivers noi obeying ihe yield signs 
could end up injuring ones who 
obey them. I believe a method of 
controlling ihe tum-aboul needs to 
be thought about for the students 
safety Also, ihe lanes need to be 
marked so drivers know what each 
lane is used for.

Editor mistaken 



To the editor: 



This is in regards 10 Tony Laux's 
Duty Laundry column titled "Fire 
Knight; hire Alford." 

I feel that whai Tony staled 
about ihe teams, I.U. mosily, was 
not called for. 

It appears lhat he has no opinion 
of his own and the only thing he is 
capable of is disparaging others, 
rather than forming an opinion of his 

What is ihe poinl of being a 
Sports Editor if all you can do is pul 



Finding a spot 



(earns down 1 

I realize he was trying lo be 
funny; however, he did a better job 
of being annoying 

Next lime, Tony, try noi to be 
such an authoritarian.

To the editor: 

[ have searched for months 
Mill, as I drive around campus, I 
have yet 10 find a parking lot that 
will consistently have an open spot 
during Ihe morning. 

Then again, I cannot really say 
thai is entirely true. ! guess the park- 
ing lots by Gaits Sports Center may 
have open spaces. 

It is just too bad thai il seems 
like a mile to walk to all of my 
classes from those lois 

This is not a big problem in 
good weather. However, when it is 
cold and raining, 1 am a mess by ihe 



lime 1 get to my first class 

I know ihere is a new parking 
garage under construction right 
now, I have beard lhat currently 
there is no completion date 

Is there really someone who 
thinks ihe parking situation is not a 
problem? 

I really do not understand why 
ihey would lake their time on this 
projecL

Payment 
deadline 
unfair 

To the editor: 

1 I feel it is outrageous that all 
fees for each semester must be paid 
only one day after the last day for 
registration. 

This is particularly outrageous 
for early registration 

I am aware tbey set ihis dead 
line so people will not sign up for 
classes after ihey change iheir minds 
about attending that semester, thus, 
filling the classes for later registra- 
tion. 

However, I feel there should be 
some way of holding your schedule 
withoul having 10 pay the full 
amouni, one half of the amount or 
even one fourth of the amouni due. 
If pain in installments additional 
fees are added 10 your total. 

You should be able to hold your 
schedule at leasl for a week after the 
last date of registration. 

This would not deprive later reg- 
istration does not even begin for 
nearly two weeks after ihe early. 

1 simply feel there should be 
some reasonable and humane 
approach on the part of ihe Bursar's 
office.

Parking situation hurts students 



To the editor: 

Of all of the perplexing prob- 
lems in ihe world going around in 
my head, the one thai summons the 
most belief in me is the lack of stu- 
dent parking for IPFW students. 
How can a college campus have 
such a lack of concern for its stu- 
dents? 

This problem goes deeper than a 
bemoaned student's frustration of 
parking availability. 

It goes right 10 Ihe heart of a stu- 



dent's chance for an equal opportu- 
nity for an education. 

This problem can cause students 
10 miss classes and in lum, disrupts 
their grades. 

I do not feel thai a studenl's 
grades should be disrupted because 
they losi ihe race 10 ihe last parking 
spot. 

Not only does it pose a problem 
for students, but it is also upsetting 
to the professors. 

II is not unusual for a class 10 
have numerous late comers because 



of their searching. 

IPFW needs 10 hold off all other 
projects needing money and concen- 
trate on (he one studenis are mosi 
concerned with. 

If a college refuses to take care 
of the people thai should be, ihey 
will eventually not have anyone to 
take care of.

Voluntary evacuation not good 



To the editor: 

I am writing in response to the 
issue of bomb threats that have been 
occurring since September. As a stu- 
denl of IPFW. this has affected me 
almost every week since I have been 
here. I think the count is up lo eigh- 
teen now. This is my First semester 
here and 1 am already getting a bad 
impression. 

I admit I do noi mind missing 
class once in awhile, but I live 40 
miles away and have only two class- 
es a day. In other words I am only 
here for an hour and then go home. 
This is a waste of my time I do like 



missing classes, but lhat is noi my 
point. 

1 recently learned the bomb 
threats are now optional in terms of 
whether or not students have to 
evacuate tbe building. 

I do not know aboul you but 1 do 
not mind getting out of class other 
than il being cold this lime of year. 
The only real problem with this is if 
the person calling in ihese threats is 
really disturbed. 

They may noi think we are tak- 
ing them senously and might decide 
10 actually place a bomb in a partic- 
ular building. I know I do not want 
lo push the wrong buttons when it 
comes to an issue like this. 



If this person is not taken seri- 
ously, many people may gel hurt. 
You never know if there is another 
Timothy McVeigh running around. I 
know it seems to be out of the ordi- 
nary but I am sure ihere are people 
thai would do this. 

What 1 am really trying to say is 
lhat if ihere is a bomb Ihreai in ihe 
building I am going lo or am cur- 
renily in, I am getting the bell out of 
there, whether ihe teacher likes il or 
not. Won'l you join me?

Honesty always best policy 



Eyes facing forward: Jeremy Ecenbarge* 




surprise 

z in a 
physics class, a 
cai crash that 
leaves you 
stranded or a 
relationship 
that just seems 
to never work out, the circum- 
stances can catch you totally off 
guard. Many times, these events can 
change the way you look at life for- 
ever. 

People weave many webs in 
today's sociely, It often seems to get 
harder and harder to understand 
what people are thinking and feel- 
ing. People often say one thing and 
mean another. Even worse, they 
often say nothing at all. It seems to 
be another battle to even compre- 
hend ourselves, rather than those 
around us. 

People who have read Moliere's 
"Misanthrope" may understand this 
story discusses whether one should 
always be totally honest or only in 
certain situations. Even though this 
book was written in the 1800's, it 
very much deals with situations in 
today's time. It flirts with the notion 
of whether someone should be hon- 
est with the ones ihey care for or 
whether they should just say the 
things that others want 10 hear. It 



also discusses how many times mis- 
conceptions can lead to things that 
go beyond anyone's control. 

It is kind of like that MCI com- 
mercial when ihey say you can talk 
freely on Mondays. If you have not 
seen it, the characters say things that 
are purely honesi about the ones 
they are talking to on the phone. The 
truth is not pleasant and surely, they 
were not the listener's intended 
responses. 

Even though this is a mere 
advertisement for a telephone ser- 
vice, it docs raise some interesting 
questions: How honest should we 
really be? When are the appropriate 
times to be sincere? 

We all to deal with these types 
of situations daily. Whether ii is a 
husband, wife or lover who says, 
"Oh, I look awful today," they seem 
to be looking for a pleasant 
response. They may be hoping for, 
"Oh, sweetheart. You look gor- 
geous." 

And they probably don't warn lo 
bear, "Yeah, you're right. Maybe 
you should tame that hair a little." 

I used to go through my week 
and pick out at least ten instances 
that I gave out responses that were 

simply well, they were simply 

lies. Yet, many people find the 
excuse that they were only taking 
the other person's feelings inio con- 
sideration. But are they really 
exceptions? 

I find this complete honesty in 



only given situations to be a very 
lame theory. Nevertheless, I guess I 
recently learned this after years of 
experiencing the negative effects of 
the whole scenario. 

Throughout everyone's life, I 
believe there comes a lime when we 
begin to respect the true opinions of 
those around us. And even though 
they may be different from our own. 
we do recognize the importance that 
they play. 

Nothing aggravates me more in 
the world than someone who is very 
complimentary and never disagree- 
ing. People who never seem to have 
one ounce of integrity to say what 
they feel. Instead, they go through 
their days conversing with those 
Ihey really cannot understand, yet 
do not have the courage to criticize. 

At social gatherings, these 
events take place quite often. We 
converse with several people who 
we heatedly cannot stand, yet main- 
tain a type of closure in order to 
avoid controversy. 

We offer compliments and 
inquire about things that have been 
going on in the person's life, only to 
scrape up something we can com- 
plain about later. We fake our way 
through these evenings and seem 
rather impartial. 

So, as I look over these events, I 
think I realise just bow stupid and 
absent-minded some people are. 
Nevertheless, it seems that no mat- 
ter how hard you try to avoid those 



that put on such a fake facade, they 
almost always return. You cannot 
run from them. There appears to be 
only limited ways to avoid them. 
Confrontation, at some point, seems 
to be the only clear answer. 

Most of the time, after the con- 
frontation is done, both of you will 
realize just how stupid yen have 
both been. Perhaps many of your 
problems were just fueled by those 
misconceptions you have had of one 
another. Or. if this is not (he case, at 
least you wdl know that you have 
been true to them and to yourself. 

Maybe people's fears of the 
opinions of others stem from our 
own low esteems. Many of us want 
to be generally liked by everyone. 
But no mailer how hard one tries, 
this can never be the case. 
Compliments and criticisms both 
build character. Without one, there 
Li mid not be the other. It is all part of 
life. 

In the end, 1 think we all respect 
those who are honest. As unpleasant 
as many of their words may be, we 
learn to respect their opinions. And 
when they eventually offer some- 
thing positive, we can believe their 
words instead of saying, "Oh. 
you're just saying that." 

Being honesi is a valuable char- 
acter in any person. It gives a person 
the power to be opinionated, the 
power to be trusted and the respect 
that many of us lack. It's true, hon- 
estly. 



Fame not all it's supposed to be 



Big Rob's RambLings: Robert Enders 



from page one 



Bonnell and the faculty 

review were not given to the board. 

"Part of the problem is the uni- 
versity's cavalier altitude toward 
this review process At every rum, 
they treated this as something they 
had to go through, not as if some- 
one's academic career is on the 
line," Bonnell said. 

The university's attitude con- 
cerning the board of review was the 
catalysi that started the suit, Bonnell 
said. 

English said the university has 
responded to this complaint through 
the university's lawyer at Purdue. 
The university said the complaint 
was not filed in a timely fashion. 

"There are 300 days to file after 
the final decision and she filed 329 
days after it," English said, 

English said IPFW bas not 
beard anything from Jones or her 
lawyer since they filed a motion 
claiming the suit was fded too late. 

"As far as I know that's dead," 
English said. 

Sleffy said she was not familiar 
enough with the case lo comment on 
it. The board found procedural prob- 
lems concerning the reappointment 
process during the spring semester 
of 1996. when English denied 
Jones' reappointment. 

Although the university consid- 
ers this issue dead, Jones said she 
filed her complaini with the Equal 
Employment Opportunity 
Committee fEEOO in January. 

Jones said she was worried 
about this complaint affecting her 
position now. 

"When one complains, that can 
nave the effect of travelling with 
you," Jones said. 

Jones leaches at Purdue-West 
Lafayette and has a chance to be in a 
tenure track position. 

Jones said she was not unhappy 
about leaving the university and said 
she was concerned about clearing 
her record. 

"I wanted out of there. It was 
not a good place lo be after things 
started lo change. They lowered the 
standards in the department and I 
didn't want to be there," Jones said. 

There were also alumni surveys 
sent oui by English which were sup- 
posed to be for constructing Jones' 



dossier for future promotion and 
tenure The board found that English 
did nol collect the data for his said 
purpose, but that il was "inappropri- 
ately used as a basis for non-reap- 
pointmenl." 

"My case was not evaluated on 
the merits itself." Jones said. 

Jones alleges IPFW violated 
Tule VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964 and the equal pay act. 

"These acts of IPFW by and 
through the Defendant Indiana 
University caused plaintiff to suffer 
both monetary harm and emotional 
distress," Jones' complaini said 

She also said in her complaini 
she was denied equitable increases 
in salary although ber contributions 
concerning teaching, research and 
service compared well with males in 
the department "who received a 
greater increase in salary than she 
received." 

Jones attempted to attain anoth- 
er professor's tenure review docu- 
ments from the professor's board 
hearing but the professor declined to 
give this to her. 

She said it was nothing person- 
al, but she just got caught in the 
gears of office politics. 

"I'm really quile naive about 
office politics," Jones said. 

The board was unable to make a 
decision concerning gender discrim- 
ination because the board "did not 
receive the information necessary to 
conduct a comparative review and 
determine the validity of ibis allega- 
tion." 

Jones said she thinks the deci- 
sion not to reappoint ber was due to 
her affiliation with another former 
professor who disagreed wilh cer- 
tain policies. 

"If anyone comes down in the 
process, I'm sorry. I'm just fighting 
for my right lo be heard," Jones 
said. 

The suit asks the court to grant 
judgments in her favor concerning 
monetary damages and attorney 
fees. 

Jones also asked the court to 
find in her favor concerning all 
issues in the law. 

Chancellor Michael Wartell said 
he could not comment on this issue 
because it concerns a personnel

So I figured I'd be doing every- 
one a favor if I found someone who 
wanted to be famous. That way, the 
media could harass someone who 
doesn't mind it and everybody else 
can enjoy an extra 15 minutes of

Sugar-Frosted Bishops interviewed 



by Dodie Miller 
Chief Reporter 



A chilly Tuesday night in 
November found me inside 
Columbia Sure! West, enjoying the 
spirited talent of another original 
Fort Wayne band. 

The Sugar- Frosted Bishops 
(a Monty Python reference?) were 
playing as a part of Midwest 
Original Music Showcase 
(MOMS.) These guys add a 
dimension to the "original music" 
classification. I could make this 
very brief by saying you should 
have been there, but you weren't, so 
I'll tell you what you missed. 

It is obvious that the 
• Bishops are talented young men. A 
group without talent could not gel 
away with the quirky instrumcnia- 
'jjon carried out by the Bishops. The 
Bishops are successful in what they 
'. do by not going to musical extremes 
for very long. 

"Spy Song" was a rollick- 
ing tune with a strong undercurrent 
; built of lower register notes. This 
; added depth to the song and remind- 
; ed me of beach music for intcllceiu- 
\ als. Needless to say. 1 kind of want- 
ed to dance I could tell the rest of 
the audience was also pleasantly 
surprised. 1 kept seeing people look 



at each other like, "Can you believe 
this?" with smiles on their faces. 

Just when you think you 
have the Bishops pegged, they 
switch on you. You hear the beach- 
type music and you figure you're in 
for a night of 60's throwbacks The 
evening's boink-rock repertoire 
included a chipmunk-voiced (Alvin, 
Simon and Theodore) song that con- 
tained what I thought were instru- 
ment pans so pathos-laden that 
Morrissey would be jealous. 

I laughed, because the 
vocals were funny and it was the 
Bishops, I wasn't supposed to take 
them seriously. Someone in the 
audience asked one of his buddies 
"How'd tbey do that?" Who cares? 
It's entertaining! 

The Bishops enjoy experi- 
menting with artificial vocals. 
There was a deep, slow voice song 
(think Walkman batteries dying) 
with plucky rhythmic bass that 
reminded me of Jeffrey "Stay With 
Me Tonight" Osboumc and Billy 
"Caribbean Queen" Ocean. If you 
want to gel a good idea about how 
the deep vocals sound before you 
get the Bishop's tape, check out 
Styx's album, "Kilroy Was Here." 
The lovely song, "Heavy Metal 
Poisoning" has the same muffly, 
ominous vocals employed in more 
than one Bishops song

Student Takes Education One Day at a Time 



By Abigail Horrom 
Staff Writer 

Imagine staring at a blank test, 
'trying hard to concentrate on the 
[first question. However, the person 
[sitting to your left keeps shuffling 
: papers and the person to your right 
lis chewing gum 

Imagine again that those 
minute noises begin to take control 
of your concentration. After several 
minutes, you're trembling and all 
you want to do is just shake sense- 
less the individuals responsible for 
■the noise. 

Unfortunately, this sce- 
nario is a reality for one — if not 
more — of the students on campus 

Joe (whose real name is not 
being used) is a 38-year-old man 
who has returned to school to get the 
most out of an education that he 
possibly can. One barrier, however, 
that he faces everyday is a disability 
which does not allow him to learn 
using the same methods as other stu- 
dents 

"I have what they call 
attention-defic it-hype ractiviiy-dis- 
order and dyslexia," Joe said. "I 
can't focus on things and have to 
find alternative ways to become 
educated other than reading a 
book." 

An aid that Joe finds most 
helpful during his times of struggles 
is the service for disabled students 

"(This service] works as an 
intervention group to step in ahead 
of lime; to prevent any problems." 
said Joe. 

"If you have a problem. 
you don't nave to deal wilh it on on 
your own." 

Since Randy Borst left last 
spring. Joe feels the transition with 
Susan Borror has been very smooth 
Bonor serves as head of disabled 
services. 

"She came with the enthu- 
siasm and energy needed to really 
boost the program — keep the pro- 



gram going. 

A couple of the features 
this service offers, which is what Joe 
takes advantage of, are books on 
tape and quiet places to study and/or 
take tests. One of the things which 
concerns Joe the most is the feeling 
that many students and professors 
'.inn i fully understand what is going 
on with disabled students. 

"Most of the instructors 
I've run into have been very good 
about helping However, some have 
not." Joe said. 

He feels that an education 
about the problems people have and 
and what the service actually pro- 
vides should be given, not only to 
the professors, but also to the stu- 
dents. 

"You'll find that there are 
certain instructors who, when con- 
fronted wilh this, don't want to have 
the hassle. They don'l understand 
why I can't just stay in the room and 
lake a test," Joe said. 

"Bui. as the old saying 
goes: 'Don't judge until you've 
walked a mile in my shoes.'" 

Joe believes that if people 
have a problem getting educated, it 
may not be that they're not an intel- 
ligent person, but rather that they 
have an obstacle to overcome. 

The instructors should 
understand that some students have 
such an obstacle and work with 
them lo overcome it, without 
embarrassing them in the process. 

Joe had an accident four- 
and-a-half years ago The resulting 
injury has put him through twelve 
surgeries in the last four years 

Adding this to his already 
existing disorder has made going to 
school that much more difficult. At 
times when he is feeling better, it 
makes him more determined to 



complete his degree. 

When asked bow much 
longer he'll be in school, he replied, 
"To be quite honest, I'm taking it 
one day at a time. I will complete 
my program when I'm done. 

"I know that sounds like 
sarcastic remark, but I'm not look- 
ing ai tomonrowor ihenextday. I'm 
looking al today. When I'm physi- 
cally and mentally capable and 
everything falls into line, then I'll 
look at my classes." 



player, Bishop Tutu, has a natural 
tenor that is plaintive without whin- 
ing. It comes off poignant in a 
longue-in-cheek sort of way. 

The guitar playing by 
Bishop Duengor fits in nicely and 
succumbs only to its own 90's trip. 
When the keyboards are peppy, it 
gives the songs a calliope-element. 
Think "96 Tears." When the songs 
take on an edge, il is wilh snapping 
percussion assault from a fervent, 
homogeneous music machine. 

I recently sat down wilh 

the Bishops after a practice. 

Dodie: How did you meet? 
Tutu: I met Bishop Duengor while 
in gym class in DeKalb We were 
both gettin' picked on by jocks I 
met Loors while he was auditioning 
for another band. During a break 
Loors offered me a biscuit. (Tutu

While Loors and Tutu were in 
another band. "Sock Monkey," 
Duengor became acquainted with 
Loors. The rest is history. Loors and 
Tutu subsequently got themselves 
thrown out of "Sock Monkey" after 
being repeatedly chastised for doing 
side projects, that, according to 
other "Sock Monkey" members 
"sounded like Primus," said Bishop 
Tutu with a laugh. "Everything we 
did they said it sounded like 
Primus " But no one is bitter 
Loors: The spill was beneficial for 
everyone involved. 
Dodie : How long have you been 
around? 

Loors: Been goofing for about 3-4 
years.

somewhere along the way. 

I had lofty ambitions then. I slill

smile, 

Knowing how you made me laugh. 

Hearing sweei echoes of you from

I wilt remember you. " 

— Amy i u. mi. "1 Will Remember 

You" 

Dear Friend 

Today I bought my Christmas 
cards On the drive borne from the 
store. I men- 
tally made my 
mailing list up 
in my bead. 
When I got 
home, 1 
looked in my 
over-stuffed 
address book, 
trying to make 
sure I hadn't 
forgotten any- 
one like I did 
last year. I 
quickly 
scanned each 
letter of the 
alphabet and 
zipped past 
your name and 
address. 

I know that ■ — 

you don't live 

at that address anymore, so I 
skipped over your name and moved 
on to the next letter. 1 haven't talked 
to you since 1993, and I'm not sure 
of anything about you anymore So 
1 moved on, like I have in the last 
several years in many aspects of my 
life. 

But something made me pause 
and come back to your name this 
year. I'm not exactly sure why. 
More than four years have gone by, 
and you haven't called me and I 
haven't called you. No letters have 
been written, save for a few mental 
ones that I've never put on paper 
After a year or two, it was easier to 
make up excuses that made my 
guilt go away. I guess that happens 
sometimes. 

Maybe it's my faulL I guess that 
1 was kind of in a hurry to get the 
hell out of this place and go away to 
school and see the rest of the world 



they're different now. colored by 
experience and marred by time, 
expanded by growth and changed 
by choices. Yes, of course I'm slill 
a dreamer, but now 1 know what the 
world is really like and my dreams 
are more realistic because of what 
I've learned. 

Yet. for all of what the world has 
taught me about moving on and let- 
ting go, I still find myself giving 
pause to your name and thinking of 
you 1 wonder how you are and 
whether bfe, in Her infinite beauty 
and wisdom, has been as kind to 
you as She has 
been to me. 

I don't know if 
you've heard or 
not, but I'm mar- 
ried. I've been mar- 
ried for two years 
this December. You 
didn't come to my 
wedding, so I'm 
not sure if you even 
know. My hus- 
band's everything 



Sometimes we 
take a few wrong 
turns and find out 

that we should 
have stayed where mat you and i used 
we were to begin 
with. 



dream of finding 
in a man You'd 
like him 

I tned a career 
that I thought 
would help me find 

.. my place in the 

world, but recently 
came to the conclusion that my 
future lies exactly where I always 
knew in the back of my mind it 
was — in writing. You could have 
told me that. I suppose. You always 
liked my poems and made me feel 
like I was gonna be someone some- 
day. For some stupid reason, I tried 
to make writing a part of my past — 
the "old me, " bul now I know that 
it's what makes me whole and 
makes me me. Sometimes we take 
a few wrong turns and find out that 
we should have siaycd where we 
were io begin with. 

But you. you always had a knack 
for making me catch the obvious 
things that I hurried right past and 
didn't notice. Kinda' like your 
name in this address book. I had 
Inedtolelyou fade out of my life — 
like time could erase the guilt I've 
felt for not seeing you — but your 



name made me slop and ihtnk about 



you. Once again, you've taught me 
something: some things just don't 
fade away. 

Maybe I'm holding onto a mem- 
ory that I have no right to hold onto. 
Maybe I'm just a part of a past that 
you long lo forger Maybe I'm just 
a memory gathering dust in the cor- 
ner of your soul Maybe you don't 
even remember me al all. Bul I 
remember you. 

Here I sit, writing you this letter, 
this letter that you may never see, 
confessing things to you. 
Remembering things, the strangest 
little things. You always told me 
that I was the strong, confident one, 
able lo move on and change But I 
found out that I wasn't as strong as 
I thought I was. So now, sometimes 
I find myself regretting things. 
Regretting decisions, regretting 
choices thai I made in the past. 

I'm not the same person that I 
was four years ago. and I hope that 
I've grown, in spirit and in inner 
strength. That confidence in myself 
was something that you gave to me 
I've always marched to my own 
tune, but you gave me the courage 
to play my tunc, and play it loud 
Now I play it with a strength that 
makes mountains quiver. 

I'm still too quiet, still a thinker 
who analyzes things too much, but 
I'm quieter inside than I was years 
ago I still carry the weight of the 
world on my shoulders sometimes, 
but I've taught myself to do some- 
thing about what bothers me I'm 
still gonna make a mark in this 
world, but it's not gonna be a mark 
about myself anymore. Maybe I'll 
make my mark just by being a good 
person and living an honest life. 

Wherever you are this holiday 
season, whatever path your choices 
have taken you down, 1 hope that 
you still have that sparkle in your 
eye and that truth in your bean I 
always loved that about you I hope 
that life is kind and gentle lo your 
soul. 

Thank You, my friend. I'll never 
forget what you've done for me 
Maybe we'll never see each other 
again, but if our paths should cross 
somewhere, someday, before we 
pass into forever, I'll smile I'll 
remember you and whai you gave 
me Maybe you'll even remember 
me, too. 

Love and Peace Always, 
Gail

How many of you have ever 
considered buying a new satellite 
system? If you have, you were 
probably overwhelmed by all of 
the types and names of the various 
satellite systems (DSS, Dish 

work, DirecTV. USSB. 
Primestar. C-Band, etc.). It sounds 
like a lot of choices, but choices 
usually make things better, particu- 
larly with satellite systems. This 
week. Technology Comer will give 
you a quick Who's Who of the var- 
ious systems and packages so you 
can choose the one that best suiLs 
your needs 

First. DSS refers to Direct 
Broadcast Satellite (DBS). DSS 
satellite systems are what DirecTV 
and USSBtU.S. Satellite 
Broadcasting) use to deliver their 
services. The other 18-inch satellite 
dish providers are EchoStar's The 
Dish Network and Primestar- 

Evcry system has different 
satellite system prices. Most of the 
satellite systems' prices start at 
about S200 and go up to about 
S500. Primestar does not charge 
you for the equipment, but they do 
charge for me installation (S149&gt;, 

All 18-incb satellite systems 
offer different channel packages 
USSB's basic package costs $7.95 
per month The other satellite sys- 

&gt; start with larger packages. 
The Dish Network has a 40 channel 
package that costs $19.99 per 
month. DirecTV has a 70-plus 
channel package, including 31 
Music Choice channels, for $29 99 
per month. Primestar has a 95- 
channel package thai runs $34.95 
permonlh. Whatever the case, pric- 
ing is pretty close on all four of the 
systems. 

If you are in the mood lo spend 
a little more money on a new satel- 
lite system, consider a C-Band 
satellite system. C-Band satellite 
systems have the huge satellite 



dishes that can view numerous dif- 
ferent satellites. They may be more 
expensive, but they do offer many 
more channels. The satellite pack- 
age prices vary between package 
provider, but generally are a better 
buy than the 18-incb satellite sys- 
tems. C-Band satellite systems now 
offer digital C-Band with the 4DTV 
receiver. 4DTV receivers can view 
digital channels on regular C-Band 
satellites plus regular C-Band chan- 
nels too 

All of the satellite systems 
make for a large variety of choices. 
These choices help keep prices 
lower and allow people to pick the 
satellite system that is best suited 
for them Every satellite system 
generally offers different packages 



,ih different 
channels. For example, with C- 
Band and 4DTV, you can subscribe 
to whatever you want. The variety 
of channels is extremely high on C- 
Band and 4DTV C-Band systems 

If you're still not sure about 
satellite systems, talk to a satellite 
retailer about what system would 
fit you best. With all of the choices, 
you're bound to find the perfect 
satellite system.

Mens basketball 
wins second 
straight Summit City 
Shootout 



Pippen wants oat of Chicago 



Dirty Laundru: Tony Laux 




By Tony Laux 

Sports Editor 



IN: men's basketball leam is 
off to a fine st^it al 3-0 in the early 
season. The first two wins over 
crosstown rivals, Indiana Tech (73- 
71) and Saint Francis (85-65). gave 
the Mastodons their second straight 
Summit City Shootout Title and 
Brian Johnson the MVP award. 

The last win was the toughest 
because it was an overtime struggle 
with the College of Saint Francis. 

This was where Craeldel Key 
and Adam Moore helped lead the 
Dons 10 the win despite 20 
turnovers and 1-12 shooting from 
three point range. 

Coach Williams feels that Dane 
Adams, who is averaging seven 
rebounds, is "being a steady and 
consistent player who has stepped 
up quite a bit." 



Four Dons are averaging dou- 
ble figures in points: Johnson with 
20.7; Moore with 19,3; Key with 
17.0; and Adams 12.3. 

The team is averaging 81.7 ppg 
while holding its opponents to 73.3 
PP8- 

The team's next game is on the 
road. Thursday night against Great 
Lakes Valley Conference power- 
house, the University of Southern 
Indiana (USD- 

USI was picked to win the con- 
ference in the coach's preseason 
poll. 

After this game the Dons stay 
on the road for Saturday's contest 
against Southern Illinois- 
Ed wards vi lie. 

Johnson leads the team in free 
throw percentage with 80 percent, 
but the team's overall average is 
suffering at a 60 percent rate 



Women fall 
in championship 
game against 
Saint Francis 



By Tony Laux 
Sports Editor 

The Lady's basketball team has 
fallen on bard times at the begin- 
ning of this season. 

The team split its opening two 
games losing against Bloomsburg 
(51-54) and winning against 
Geneva (78-67). 

Al the Summit City Shootout, 
the Ladydons advanced to the 
championship game by pounding 
Indiana Tech (71-49) bui falling to 
Saint Francis (76-88). 

This loss has started a string of 
three more straight losses on the 
road against Oakland College (55- 
73). Missouri-Rolla (58-62) and 
Missouri-Western (69-86). 

Leah Sheets has lead the team 
in scoring in six of the seven games 
with Katrina Hoelting leading the

Q. Which body 
fluids can transmit

A. Blood, vaginal 
fluid, semen, and 
breast milk are the 
only body fluids that 
could contain a high 
enough concentration 
of HIV to transmit the 
infection.

team lead in free throw percentage

' vacation and a 
gimme win but with the recent win 
over Indiana in basketball and the 
near upset of Notre Dame in football 
(cams, they had belter reconsider 
(heir travel plans. 

Notre Dame may be headed to a 
bowl but they had better hope for a 
team who can't run ihe ball because 
they sure can't defend it. 

Indiana is beading downhill 
quickly and things do not look tike 
they are going to get any belter 
unless ihcy can get rid of the lazy 
attitudes. 

The poor, poor Alliance. If I hear 
bow ibey don't get to have the num- 
ber one team in one of their bowls 
again I think I am going to barf! 

These are the idiots who made 
the deal and ihcy should have fore- 
seen that ihe possibility of a number 
one team from the PAC-10 or the 
Big Ten could happen. It's not like 
these conferences have had awful 
learns for the last five years. 

Since this is the last year for the 
Alliance, the Super Alliance made 
sure that the Rose Bowl would be 
included so a number one team will 
face the number two learn no matter 
what conference they come from 

'Go Bears! I don'l care where you 
go, just leave the city and take your 
worthless coach with you so a real 
team can be found. 

After a 35-point loss lo Detroit 
on Thanksgiving, I was hoping for 
another Turkey lo get his head cut 
off, but Michael McKasky empha- 
sized that Dave would be back for 
another year. 

Why? He can't get the team to 
perform and the taleni isn't there 
Since they are in line for the second 
pick they need to start figuring out 
who they can ship out and try lo get 
more picks in the draft Look for 
Alonzo Spellman and Rashaan 
Salaam lo be gone by draft day. 



Scottie Pippen wants to be 
traded: 

5. He figures whining helped Shawn 
Kemp to gel more money so it 
should work for him. 

4. Since Central Arkansas is in the 
NAIA (National Association of 
Ineligible Athletes) his degree might 
nol mean as much 

3. He wants to expand his horizons 
by playing for another contender, 
like Denver 



2. He may be on the list of the 50 
best in the NBA, but obviously not 
on the 50 smartest 

1. Since Albert Belle arrived in 
Chicago. Pippen got tired of losing 
"Biggesi Crybaby in Chicago 
award" 

'Since the Colts have all but locked 
up the number one pick in the NFL, 
draft the speculation is whether they 
will take Peyton Manning as the 
number one pick. 

The Colts should figure out thai 
they need more than a quarterback 
bul of course ihcy will waste the 
pick so that ihey can have four quar- 
terbacks on their roster who can't 
complete a pass because ihey are loo 
busy running for their lives. 

•The Pacers have started to come 
together as a team and are steadily 
moving up the Central Division 
standings. 

I would never have believed it 
but Jalen Rose is starting to become 
a point guard who can pass instead 
of just one who can't shoot. 

Now if (he team can figure out 
that they need other people to score 
olher than Reggie. 

•Purdue coming off its "satisfying" 
trip to Bloomington may not be 
smelling roses but they are headed 
to a bowl. 

Fans you can admit that you 
though! when the team hired Tiller 
as coach he was gomg to be another 
Fred Akers but thank God for bring- 
ing "basketball on grass" to West 
Lafayelte. 

•Eddie Robinson ended his career 
this weekend afler 56 years as head 
coach at Grambling. He was hired 
in 1941 and compiled a 408-165-15 
lifetime record in his 56 years 
WOW!! 

•Top Five flops of the year: 

5. The Chicago Bulls It's early but 
they are looking very vulnerable 



4. Indiana Hoosiers. Losing in foot- 
ball and basketball New coach, new 
uniforms and they siill got spanked 
by the Boilers. 

3. Tennessee Vol's. You have got (o 
beat Florida. 

2. Miami Hurricanes. The NCAA 
sanctions finally have nailed them. 
If they njiii.il only bail oul Iheir 
defensive backfield ihey may have 
had a team. 

1. Colorado Buffaloes Preseason 
#1 what a joke? 

•Top Five surprises of the 

year: 

5. Missoun. Take away Nebraska's 
fluke touchdown and they would be 
number one on this list 

4 Cleveland Indians. Admit it, when 
you saw Albert Belle leave, you 
thought the old lousy Indians would 



return. 

The Browns left and they started 
to suck, so why not? 

3. IPFW mens basketball. Two years 
ago. the Dons couldn't buy a win. 

Now, with a new coach they've 
started to win 

2. Notre Dame Afler opening losses 
to Purdue and Michigan, the season 
looked hopeless. 

And with Colletto as offensive 
coordinator, no one thought the Irish 
had a chance to beat anyone, let 
alone two ranked teams in two 
weeks. 

1. Purdue. The Boilers showed they 
had talent and drive, but with a 
decent coach, ihcy became a team to 
be reckoned with This hasn't hap- 
pened since Bob Greise played in 
West Lafayette. 

Bul don't gel your hopes up 
Boiler fans Look at where 
Northwestern was two years ago 
and look where Ihey arc now
