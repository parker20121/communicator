Last week, the Fort Wayne City 
Council voted 7-1-1 in support of a 
ban that would prohibit smoking in 
most enclosed public places, with 
the exception of retail tobacco stores. 
Thai decision was considered to be 
a reliable indicator of the final vote 
on the issue, expected January 23. If 
approved, the ban would officially 
lake clteci June 1. 

In addiiion to tobacco stores, 
smoking would remain legal in 
private homes, vehicles and rooms 
of long-term care facilities, as well 
as designated hotel or motel rooms. 
20 feel outside the door of a place of 
employment or government building 
and 200 feet from a hospital. 

IPFW senior and non-smoker, 
Shannon Buonocore is in favor of the 

smelling like smoke, or like at 
bowling alleys, you leave and reek 
of smoke." said the Media and Public 
Communication major. "It would be 
a lot healthier environment [with the 
ban]. I feel second-hand smoke is 
really harmful." 

The negative consequences of 
smokine. as well as sci.nnd-h.jrul 



smoke, are well-documented and 
highly publicized. In fact, at the 
city council meeting last week, a 
presentation was given higliliehinig 
the deaths and health problems 
caused by exposure to smoke. 

According to William Culp 
M.D., a physician with Ear, Nose 
and Throat Associates P.C. in Fort 
Wayne, side effects from smoking 
include an increased risk for heart 
attacks, respiratory disease, chronic 
lung disease, hypertension, obesity 
and cancer. Non-smokers who are 
regularly exposed to secondhand 
smoke arc just as likely as smokers to 
develop these s.imc health problems. 
"Being exposed to second-hand 

smoking yourself," Dr. Culp said. "If 
you go someplace with smokers, you 
might as well be smoking." 

He added that children who are 
repeatedly exposed to cigarette 
smoke are more likely to suffer from 
asthma, respiratory infections and ear 
infections. 

And despite the fact that many 
restaurants already have separate. 
enclosed rooms set aside tor smoking 
customers, Dr. Culp feels that the 
health of the employees is still 
unfairly put info jeopardy. 

"In the long run, if they continue 
to be in that environment, they will 
sutler many of the side effects of 
smoking." he explained. 

Opponents still worry that the 




business of local 
will suffer.

It may not be M GM Studios, but IP- 
FW' s Siudio M is a major step in the 
right direction. Studio M is the lat- 
est technological innovation at IPFW 
that allows students to create every- 
thing from a PowerPoint presentation 
to a 3-D animated video. Anything 
from designing animated .gif files to 
editing DVD's and recording audio 



voice-overs is possible here. 

Located in Walb Student Union, 
room 221A, this studio has six com- 
puters, [hve XI workstations (Win- 
dows XP) and one iMac G5 (OS 
10.4.8)|, an overhead projector and 
screen, two scanners (Epson Perfec- 
tion 4990) a JVC MiniDV/S-VHS 
dual video deck and an M-Audio 
FireWire 410 recording interlace. Up 
to six students can work in the studio 

"Studio M [was] designed lo help

faculty who would like to help Stu- 
dents respond with multimedia," said 
Gail Rathbun. director of the Center 
for i he Enhancement of Learning and 
Teaching (CELT), the organization 
that spearheaded Siudio M. 

The idea for this studio came from 
a spring and summer 2005 CELT 
analysis. "(Anj inventory of com- 
puter facilities available to students 
on campus found that there were no 
places where students [could) pro- 
duce more sophisticated multi-media 
proi.hu lions." smd K.nhbun. As a re- 
sult, the proposal for Studio M was 
drafted and sent to the office of the 
Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs. 
Susan Hannah, who heavily support-

Funding for Studio M was provided 
through the Information Technol- 
ogy Policy Committee (ITPC). which 
asked tor student ice h lees lobe direct- 
ed into Studio M. A small siudio was 
chosen instead of a large classroom 
due to the cost of equipment and as- 
sistant salaries. (CELT required that a

White the Music Building is almost 
complete, construction is only begin- 
ning for IPFW's campus. 

The $26 million building will be 
complete and tentatively open next 
fall, thanks lo a $19 million grant 
from the slate, supplemented with 
57 million from private and alumni 
donations. The building will include 
a 1,600-seat auditorium, which will 
hold evenls sponsored not only by the 
IPFW campus but also community 

The Music Building will be open 
and ready for students in tunc for fall 
semester 2007, but the auditorium 
will c.pen slightly Liter, in September. 

There will also be a 250-seat recital 
in]] ili.ii u ill hold small concerts and

however. Curriculum classes will be 
held in the huilding, but are not lim- 
ited to music-related studies. 
"While the music department will 
have the first chance to schedule 
classes for the semester, there will be 
others held there." said Waller Bran- 
son, Vice Chancellor for Financial 

A secondary purpose for this dual 
scheduling is m amalgamate students 
from other degree fields who would 
never otherwise enter a structure such 
as the Music Building, and expose 
them to something different. 

The Music program is currently 
housed in the basement of Classroom 
Medical. 

IPFW's campus will be going 



through an explosive growth that 
will come lo fruition tentatively by 
2010. and though the Music Building 
is not yet complete, there are already 
unolhtial plans for an addition to it, 
which would house ihe Fort Wayne 
Philharmonic. 

"It's very exciting and would really 
be a benefit for our Music program 
and our students to have those link- 
ages and artists on campus," said 
Branson. The addition is expected to 
have offices for the Philharmonic as 
well as ticket sales booths and meet- 
ing rooms. 

Though only in the preliminary 
planning stages, the addition to Ihe 
Music Building will be funded solely 
by gift funds, and the planning pro- 
cess will continue when the money is

than instant messaging, is exciting.

Inconsistent lyrical style does not justify sincerity and credibility 



By Stephanie Samples 



Recently I was driving in my car 
and heard a song 1 had never heard 
before. The chorus of the song was 
sung by a familiar voice, it was Mary 
J Blige. Who, by the way, has one of 
the most amazing voices today. Af- 
ter she sang the chorus the next verse 
came in and I recognized this rapper 
immediately, Ludacns. Whom by 
the wa&gt; I do not particularly like. 

I listened to the song and was sur- 
prised by its' lyrics as it is very un- 
usual for a rap song, or really any 
music today to talk about this sub- 

Thc song is called "Runaway 
Love". It is a story ol multiple girl-. 



lives. One has a stepfather who sex- 
ual abuses her. One has a mother and 
father who beat her. Another has an 
unloving family, and she seeks com- 
fort in an older boy and ends up get- 
ting pregnant, and has no one to tum 

to. There are other stories, 

but that is the idea. All of == 
these women are sad, lone- 
ly, and hurt in the situations 
that surround them. 

After Ludacris goes 
through each of the verses 
of the girls situations Mary 
comes in and sings the cho- 
rus. The lyrics of the chorus 
are all about how each girl is going to 
runaway and never come back.

So granted at hrst muhcuiic might 
think that it is nice that a rapper is 
taking on such a serious issue, but 
I have different feelings. If another 
rapper and written this song I might

have a different reaction, but coming 
from him it seems ridiculous. 

Ludacris has built his career on 
speaks and says something about songs that are sexual explicit. Many 



heard by linn arc about what he is 
going to do to a woman, or what she 
is going to do to him. 

Others are all about some part of 
a woman's' anatomy and how she 
needs lo shake it for linn All of these 
reason, and mure are why 1 think it

If it had been a tew years between 
songs, than maybe I would think that 
he could have turned over a new leal 
I don't think this is the case when 
his last song just only a lew months 
ago was "Shake Your Mmiev Maker" 
which Joes not really seem like a 
support anthem for women. 

How can an artist in one breath 
treat women with such disrespect, 
and in the next sa\ he feels for them 
I am not just attacking Ludacns or 



rap music, because many male artist-, 
trom dillerent genres have made mu- 
sic that is just as disrespectful. 

1 understand that not all of music 
has to be taken so seriously, but why 
is hardly any ol n taken seriously. 

What message do young men and 
even adult men get about women 
when (hey see some of these videos, 
and what message are women getting 

about themselves? 

If all a man sees is a woman be- 
ing treated like a possession for en- 
tertainment, is that what he will think 
of all women?

Reality TV out of control and addictive 



How and why we stick to the tube 



By Michelle Yahne 

The agony of Iclevision ihese 
days has really gollen my wheels 
turning recently, as I seemingly have 
become more addicted to reality TV, 
and I HATE il. For some reason, late 
at night, when my brain should be 
resting and counting sheep or some- 
thing. "The Hills", or "The Duel". 
or "American Idol" come floating 
inlo my head, and therefore, I cannot 
sleep until I watch it all. 

What's going on in Lauren's life? 
Or who's getting kicked off? Even 
better, will Paula be acting drunk in 
this episode? 

Why oh why is my link- brain 
obsessed wuli oilier people's lives.' I 
love my life- great family, good job, 
ama/ing boyfriend and friends. So 
why must I watch lo see whether or 
not so-and-so wins the money? The 
only "reality" show that I t.tn defend 
watching is "Survivor", and that's 
because amid the drama and con- 
flu i/resulution aspect, is an actual 
mind and body competition (it's like 
"I emends of the Hidden Temple" lor 



grown ups- if you hadn't alreads in- 
ured that out). 

I think I have realized the two rea- 
sons most people watch reality TV. 

First: Lavish shows like the "Bach- 
elor" and "Beauty and the Geek" 
where average joes (aha - pardon the 

ously in the lap of luxury, with gigan- 
(ii mansions, butlers, and (he like. 

Second: lo witness people make 
fools of themselves is key. I 






for 



"American Idol", the dating shows 
like "Elimidalc," "Next," the new- 
est, "Exposed" (by the way, the dis- 
claimer at (he end of the show even 
says ihat the software they use is 
NOT a repulable or reliable means of 
iruihlulness), or my favorite, "I Love 
New York." all make people look 
like numb-skulls. 

Who in their right mind wants 
lo watch realiiy shows? I'll tell you 
who Me. Bui I couldn't tell you whj 
exactly. 

Perhaps it's because most of H 
makes me laugh hysterically, like 
when Adrienne Cuny refuses to par- 
ticipate in half the events in Vhl's 



Celebrity Paranormal Project What 
was the point in going on that show 
Adrienne/ Like you didn't know you 
were going to a supposedly haunted 
place? 

Maybe it's because I think the Dar- 
win Awards are accepting the year's 
candidates from reality TV. Remem- 
ber when the woman on "Married h\ 
America" was.... ALREADY mar- 
ried? And not only that, the paper- 
work specifically staled you could 
not have ever been married. What, 
did you forget? 

Sometimes what happens in Ve- 
gas doesn't always stay there. 

So regardless. I think I am more 
ama/ed by how stupid people can let 
themselves look on national, some- 
times international television. Yes, 
your mother will see it. and so will a 
hundred other people that you didn't 
want to see it either. 

Although there is one rc.ihtv 
show ihat has me coming back each 
episode with more and more fervor 
land my mother is rolling her eyes as 
I say this), but 1 love "Dog the Bounty 
Hunter". Come on, he's kicking butt 
and taking names! And on lop of that 



he has a dozen kids, and even more 
family to help htm catch cracked out 
criminals who have jumped bond! 

Dog used to have a few hour-long 
specials here and (here in the '90s but 
Ins big break was the AAiE show he 
was offered after capturing Andrew 
Luster, the heir lo the Mas hicior 
throne, who is currently serving the 
rest of his life in prison for drug- 
ging and raping dozens of women. 
The FBI couldn't even find this guy. 
But low and behold, leave it to the 
cat with a mullet, cowboy hoots, and 
pepper spray lo Imd bun in a Mexican 
bar alter spending hundreds of thou- 
sands of dollars chasing bun around 
the world. Literally. Il was a modem 
day version of "Where in the World is 
Carmen San Diego?" 

As a student, or perhaps just a 
person with a slight attention disor- 
der, one would think that all these 
reaht&gt; shows would liz/le and fade- 
away. But yet there are Ions of new 
mil.-, popping upc\er&gt;da) I could go 
on to list them, but well, this paper 
jus! isn't long enough for that. 

So what is it that makes a hit 
reality show? 



I think it's a combination of a 
few things. First, some sort of dra- 
ma-filled situations or at least some 
edge-of-uiur seal suspense must be 
strategically placed. Second, at least 
a few attractive looking individuals 
must heat up the scene. Third, some 
ridiculous challenge or huge moun- 
tainous obstacle must be overcome. 
But not to worry, all challenges and 
obstacles will be over by the season 
linale just in time for a new one for 
sweeps week! 

So, Please America, if you're 
going to be on reality television, at 
least be honest with yourself that you 
will have no control over what will 
be shown, and chances are, no matter 
how you live your life, that is NOT 
how it will be portrayed on TV. With 
that said, where do I sign up? Only 
kidding. 

Actually, where are the produc- 
ers to just approach people with con- 
tracts? I mean, they've got to be run- 
ning out of idiots, so why aren't they 
pounding the streets, or knocking on 
doors? Ah well, it's just a shame they 
don't have any quality programs on 
anymore. Or do they?

African artist highlights Visual Arts building 



By Said El-Dajani 



For the last few years I've pur- 
sued an more inienseK. appreciating 
the principles and patience, while 
attempting to create a personality 
around my work that could represent 
a style my career could be based on. 
And 1 think mosi people can agree 
thai whatever medium or work they 
choose to quest for, they hope at the 
end, ihey served a meaningful contri- 
bution lo life and its challenges. 

I've recently come across a man 



ihal stands lor these basic principles sally connect with problems around 
and watched, even listened as he the world. 

engaged in an accent not hindering, Fred Mutcbi, a Uganda based art- 

bul poetically expressive how he in- isl, currently has his woodcut prints 
terprcts ihe world ^^=^= 

around him through 
wood carving and 
print making. 

The art form alone 
is mesmerizing, but 
ihe process is ambi- 
tiously admirable. 

What makes his post-visualized displayed in the Visual Arts Building 
creations so much more beautiful is Showcase, explicitly demonstrating 
how he passionately feels about his his unique style of color harmony, 
country and ils themes that univer- composition, and cultural richness. 



"The art form alone is 

mesmerizing, but the process 

is ambitiously admirable." 



His messages, intentions, and at- 
tention to detail are thought provok- 
ing and visually stimulating. His 
work is political, nature conscious, 
and truth in a language ilia! everyone 
can speak and comprehend. 

The opportunily of checking out 
Fred and his fluently eloquent an 
vocabulary is a learning experience 
which allows you to feel and under- 
stand his d&gt; namiL compositions. 

So if you have some time by Fri- 
day, feel free lo attend his print work- 
shops open to everyone from 10:30 
a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. to 
4:00 p.m. in rooms 217-219. 



This will give you an opportu- 
nity to check out the tedious yel in- 
teresting process ol woodcarving. On 
Ihiusday. January 25, in room 204, 
Mutebi will be having an Artist Lec- 
ture thai sounds promising. 

I ensure you that there is noth- 
ing more relaying than checking out 
some art that takes you out of your 
shoes, opens your mind, and leaves 
you more grateful for ihe world we 
lake for granted. 

Fred's work comes off display on 
February 9 so make sure lo stop by 
and check out his wonderful exhibi-

Incubus wants 
you to light 
grenades 









every t 



which leaves a mark mi Ilk' recording 
industry is somewhai pigeonholed. 
They may not want to be stylistically 
tied down, but many times the tans, 
the record label, or both demand a 
certain sound from them. Sure, a cat- 
egory like "rock" is a rather large um- 
brella with many facets underneath, 
but if you find success underneath 
that umbrella, emerging from it may 
be the equivalent of stomping on 
one's own foot. 

Incubus is a California-based rive 
piece which has been making music 
for over fifteen years. Though con- 
sidered "rock," they are bound and 
determined to visit some very differ- 
ent locations underneath the umbrel- 
la, and the results thus far have been 
consistently interesting even if not 
always copacetic with each album's 
base of fans. 

Stylistically. Incubus has gradual- 
ly toned down the energy level. Even 
a passive listen to the 1997 album 
"Science" shows a band bursting at 
the seams with energy and aggres- 
sion. Not necessarily bad aggression, 
just the sort that makes music pas- 



Witli its I 

ence" became an instant classic, and 
many (myself included) are always 
hoping to hear a re-visitation of that 
sound with each new release. 

That has not happened up to this 
point, and with the release of their 
newest record "Light Grenades," it 
J"i*5ii'' &amp;n,rn - ■! " .-ill li.iprVn'.nv,- 

What has happened is another 
evolution in the band's career. Like 
them or not. they should gamer a 
certain amount of respect for experi- 
menting with their art. "Light Gre- 
nades" shows thai, even after more 
than fifteen years, they siill care about 
their music enough lo change it up. 

This new record is difficult to de- 
scribe. In many places it is more ag- 
gressive than they have been lately. 
but thai aggression seems lo he chan- 
neled towards creating something 






: of e 



What they were Irving lo create is nut 
something I have been able to pick up 
on as of yet, and that seems to be the 
way this handworks. 

"A Crow Left of the Murder" re- 
teased in 2003 look nearly two weeks 
to grow on me enough to say that I 
liked it. "Light Grenades" seems to 
take the same indirect route. I don't 
particularly di-like anything I hear 
on this album, and what I hear is in- 
teresting enough for me to attempt 
to catch the wavelength Incubus is 
sending out. 

The band is playing as well as 
ever. Bassist Ben Kenncy (who 
joined in 20')? alter ihc departure of 
Alex Katumehl is beginning to truly 
find his role within the group, and 
guilarisl Mike Ein/iger continues 
his tradition o] making yon feel like

'A Scanner Darkly': lacking in 
substance, not substance abuse 



I'm always on the lookout for 

away from the money-making mold. 
Basically, if it seems it won't do well 
at the box office and looks even re- 
motely interesting to me, I automati- 
cally assume that it must be too in- 
telligent and artistic to fit within the 
mainstream, and ultimately that 1 
(being the "ultra-intelligent" person 
that I am) will like it. This approach, 
besides being closed minded, doesn't 
work all that well overall and has lead 
me to watch many rotten eggs. 

It is rare that I discover a film that 
is incredibly worthwhile that oth- 
ers haven't told me was worthwhile 
beforehand. Most of the time I find 
myscll being made fun of as a result 
of my movie choices, yet I trudge for- 
ward searching for the needle in the 
haystack. 

It is with this approach that I 
chose to watch "A Scanner Darkly." 
Once again, 1 come away feeling as 
if the needle must be in the haystack 
somewhere, but 1 wasn't able to find 

It must be said that this movie 
looks incredible. The whole dung is 
like a living cartoon. This animated 
look was done using a process known 
as rotoscoping. Basically, animators 
traced over shots of live actors frame 
by frame. One can imagine that this 
must have been painstaking work, but 
the end result is a sight to behold.
