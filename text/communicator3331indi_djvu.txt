away one miglil think ih.it if ll'EW 
wen; lo become a Division 1 school 
it might boost Ihe Fun Wayne ccon- 
omy More people coming lo Fort 
Wayne lo cither watch games ot go 
to school could possibly result in 
more business and possibly more 
employment. 

It might bring ihe cily of Fort 
Wayne closer mgiiher and make us 
one big happy cily. Il is hard nol lo 
look at die other I earns that have 
been brougbl into Fori Wayne lo 
boost the Fan Wayne community. 



The Fori Wayne Fury, the Fori 
WauM Wizards and Ihe Fori Wayne 
Komcls are here lo bring fun and 
family cnlcnammenl and revenue lo 
ihe city. People would come from 
the northern areas of Indiana and 
Olim 10 watch these seining learns 
The problem is. though, if 
these icams arc not having a win- 
ning season wiih the possibility o( 

really comes oui io Ihe games. Il is 
not too often these days lhal one 
drives by and finds every seal filled 
al Ihe Wizards' guiles Granied. the 
Kl . ■ r j. e I - probably Nad 'el I -out games 
Ihis year, bul they aJso had a win- 
nine season. So. whal happens to 
IPFW if they are nol having a win- 
nine season' Does die trend coniin- 
ue here with a drop in attendance.' 

Second. !« us look at IPFW. 
Gomg Division I would probably 
raise enrollment and mean more ath- 
letes w; ;&gt; io come and more slu- 

denis warning to be pan of Ihe 
Division I atmosphere winch would 
dcruniels be a positive bencfil of 
IPFW going Division!. 

Il seems lhal one or the main 
reasons for IPFW going Division 1 is 
lo draw more people here and 
impr.-se IPFW as a whole. Hey. we 
are all for improvement, bul whal 
mil he expected in return? Arc the 
coaches going lo have scl standards 



:t IPFW m 



to obtain throughout the season? 
Also, going Division 1 is probably 
going to change how they handle 
things. There is probably a big dif- 
ference between Division I and 
Division II on how things are han- 
dled because there is more money 
involved and the sport* themselves 
seem io be in a dilTcreni league, 
i say lhal Division tl is going 
c easily rieht on up 
in Division I is L.ghly unlikely. 

In the end. there is a lol more 
than just this lhal comes to mind 
when discussing the issue. 
t on.idenng we lust decided lo iry 10

a lone nay logo We have heard the

Tbcy make il all seem so sim- 
ple, when in reality it is not Keep in 
mind that the Purdue president musl

There are also a lot of factors 
that need to be looked at. Il definite-

who 



Supporter of Knight brings her point of view to the court 



Mnlissa Frilz, Managing Edilo 
Bob Knighl is once again the 
center of controversy, then again 
was he ever really qui.' Probably 
not. 1 will stan out letting you know 
lhai I'm a supponer of Coach 
Knighl and the III baskeiball team 1 
don't always agree with whal he 
does and aJso don't always agree 
with how he is portrayed in the 
media. Knighl has done some out of 
the ordinary things in his lime at 
Indiana University but he has also 
done good Ihings for ihe sehool 

Some people think that I'm 
crazy for supporting him and don'i 
understand how I can possibly sup- 
port him allcr all the ihings he has 
done, especially the more receni 
events. 1 always remind them 
(hough, thai they were all allega- 
tions and none of them proven. Oh. 
don't Ici-me fmget-Uie-ever-pfomi- 
neni videotape thai has been aired 
over and over arid over again. Even 
after a decision has been made aboul 
whal lo do with Knight, we still 
have accusations coining up and 
brought lo the atleniion of the pub- 
' Whal exactly is io be gained hy 



ihis. I'm 



gelling 



With every accusation, then: 
seems loeinne someone cl-c in deny 
Ihe charges Has anyone ever 
noticed dial the people making ihe 
accusations are Ihe ones who leli the 
program or did nol make much of 
themselves as a player? It is like 
revenge comine back at full force. 

People have said lhal ihey 
can't handle his program or did not 
know ivhai il was going to be like. 
What were Ihey expecting, a walk in 
ihe park or something? This is the 
big lime, not high school Sorry io 
let you know this How can one not 
know whal the IU baskeiball pro- 
gram is aboul? I'm sure Ihey all 
have been in a practice before decid- 
ing lo sign with the learn. I would 
dunk thai would be some kind of 
indication on how the program is 

thai Knight iv gome in chine's! how 
tie runs practice tu.t because Uilil i- 
,i prospective player coming Plus. 
Knight has always been a media 
f.ivonlt and ihe subject ol Ins prac- 
tices have probably tome up ai least 
once ot twice over his many star- ol 
loaihtiii' To use the excuse dial one

nuuee how praiiii.e- .He run is a lit- 
tle odd considering Ihey are a huge 
pan ol die program I have been on 
a basketball learn and have been lo 
baskeiball practices and trying lo 
explain whal someone is doing 
wrong or idling them whal in do is 
nol the easiest thing lo do. Coaches

U ihe pl.iyei is nni getting the Con- 
cept of what is trying lo be 
explained in them I brought up the

il is fooiball and lhat ihey are 
allowed io do that Whal's Ihe dil-

more physical lhan Ihe other. 

between physically moving some- 
one and chokmg ihcm. bul pi, nine 
your hands around someone's neck

someone's neck for whal appeared 
10 be a couple of seconds as proof ol 



the supposed choking incident. You 
cannol even tell if it is Reed or not. 
The video was not of die highest 
quality either. 

Everyone is determined to 
jump on Knight's temper as if he is 
the only coach in college baskeiball 
to have one, but as some say. other 
coaches are nol as severe. Now who 
is io make lhal judgment? Jusi 
because we have nol heard aboul 
olher coaches' tempers does nol nec- 
essarily mean lhat theirs is not like 
Knight's or possibly even worse. 
Ihere have been coaches out there 
who have said Iheir temper is no dif- 
ferent from Knight's. 

Try to give Knighl some end ■ 
il, even if il is a Utile bit. His temper 
over Ihe pasi couple of seasons is 
nut as bad as il used (o be. I wd[ 
agree with a lol of people lhal his" 
temper was bad a few years ago and 
should nol have gone unpunished If 
ihey would have dcall wiih ihcsc 
accusalions three years ago like Ihey 
are Irying to deal with Ihcm now. 1 
would probably understand if they 
would have asked for his resigna-

resignation is II he did do Ihings. 
ses. he needs in he punished, hul he 
should have been punished ihrec 
years ago when Ihcse accusations 
lirst wile brought in Ihe allention ril 
Indiana University. I agree with the 
punishtneni Knighl was given. If 
ihey wanted his resignation. Ihey 
should hiit done thai a long lime 

ago. 

Knighl has been given sel slan- 
d.uds and rules which he is lo fol- 
low. If he violates ihem, he will be 
let go from Indiana University. 
Coaches should have rules. 
However, who Ls actually' going to 
enforce these rules on Knighl' lo 
say Brand will or someone else will 



noi. One way or anoiher. either 
Indiana University or Knight is 
I'oine io hi the wrong end ol die 
deal. 

I have had the opportunity in 
meet Coach Knighl and found him 
to be a very pleasant and nice guy. A 
lot ol people mighl disagree wiih me 
on thai, bul 1 can understand their 
view because he is not always lhai 
way Knight does in. ike sure that his 
players arc passing iheir classes and 
graduate Kindii seems to be one of 
those people thai you either like or 
you don't. 

Til ere arc definilcly two sides 
lo Kmehi. I don'l excuse ihings lhal

sore he has also losl some suppoilcrs 
along ihe way and possibly gained

these rules, anoiher might sav is 



point ..I view to the recent situn is 

in both the negative and positive 
light ot it all As my paslor said in 
church on Sunday, there has been so 
much aboul Knighl lately in Ihe 
new- dial he actually misses hearing 
about Mian (ion/ale/ Hopefully, 
ihis will all stui to coo) down from

Decision-making in life 



Adam Taylor, Slaff Writer 

Recently 1 was luld lhat a good 
friend of mine was getting mamed 
and then, all of a sudden, she was I 
was very happy. Ihough shocked, lo 
hear lhal she'd gone through with it 
alter having scheduled numerous 
dalu over the past year and cancel- 
ing all of them. Many of us were 
beginning lo believe lhal she would 
never aclually do il bul. lo and 
behold, she did. 

The shock lhat my friend had 
finally gotlen married wore olf 
almosi as soon as it came on and 
things Killed down in my humble 
world once again. 1 couldn't gel over 
one Uioughl in my head, ihough. 
This girl is Iwo years younger than I 
am and has been my friend since I 
was 17 and here she was married. Il 
was son of alarming in iiself. Docs 
Ihis mean I'm old enough lo be mar- 
ried now? Would I have what it 
lakes lo lake the vows? Can 1 handle 
thai responsibility and would I want 
to? 

I already know the answers to the 
first three questions, bul the last is 
ihe one lhat boggles me still. 1 real- 
ly didn't know if I warned to be mar- 
ried yet, Although I really love my 
girlfriend and have for over a year 
and a half now, marriage isn'l somc- 
ihitig I lake lightly. This doesn't 
mean I don't love my girlfriend 
enough lo marry her someday, il just 
means nol yet. 

The whole marriage question lhal 



was perplexing m 

couple ol weeks ii 

had wiih my brother and some 

friends in Tennessee on Ihe night 

prior to my sister's college gradua- 

Wc were all talking aboul our 
nliiinnship.v and my brolhcr, who. 
with lite exception of my- sister. was 
the only single person there, said he 
didn't see die point in having a rela- 
tionship This prompted everyone to 
offer their reasons for being with the 
person they're with, mine being lhai 
I have a good time wiih her He then 
had ihe tenacity, lo question ihe insti- 
tute or marriage as a whole. 
Growing somewhat angry over his 
poorly tlioughi out rjtiunale, I coun- 
tered, saving that being a part of a 
lailuly is probably ihe best dung dial 
could have ever happened to me as it 
kept me out of trouble and helped 
me to prosper as a human being over 

We quickly dropped ihe con- 

icisatton as tl was becoming some- 
what heated, bul we'd gotlen Ihe 
answers we wanted. I knew dial, 
someday. I wanted to get married 
and pass ihe love I'd received in my 
life on lo others, hoping to make 
Iheir lives a little more enjoyable 

As I reflected on lhal decision 
and on the siluaiion wiih my girl- 
friend noi graduating at ihe same 
ume I will, a new question present- 
ed itself. If I love ihis girl enough io 



someday marry her, do I love her 
enough to put my life on hold Tor her 
and wait lor her to graduale or do I 
move on and leave her where she is? 
After all. I don't want to be married 
yet; she doesn't warn to be married 
yet. yet neither of us want io be 
apart from each olher if we can 
avoid it. We've talked and talked 
about what we're going to do if one 
of us has 10 leave or even wanls lo 
leave before ihe other one's ready, 
bul we always end up rethinking our 
decisions. It gels funny sometimes 
because it seems as though every 
lime we work through Ihe details ol 
~ _ c of us leaving. ' 






B hail: I. 



other saying we can't go through it. 

This rurally brings me to my 

point. There is no doubi in my mind 

lhat she and I both really care aboul 






re aboul each other lhat 
much, mey shouldn't subject them- 
selves lo being far away from each 

Even if ii means making some- 
sort of compromises, compromising 
is better than boih sides losing. That 
doesn'l mean that die two people 
should rush inlo gelling married It 
jusi means lhat Ihey shouldn't break 
il off or even separale. even if it 
means pulling a career on hold 
Somciimes whal's bcller for you 
emolionally. outweighs whal's belter 
foi you iinancially. 



Lack of communication 



Mishanna Wood, Editor 






I have high regards lor Ibose 
people who keep in much with 
chums who live more than iwo 
hours away, 1 understand how diffi- 
cult it is to keep in touch How many 
of us really have the lime to sit down

lo spend Ihe money on a long dis- 
tance phone call?

tions on several occasions. I have

IPFW has something new 10 be proud of this spring. "Fashion" 
dolls, dressed in outfits modeled after the ones nam by IPFW's cbeerlead- 
inj squad, have been selling quite rapidly in the office of Alumni 
Associations. "We have been ama?ed at the reactions and response 10 
this." said fennifer Bosk, director of the Alumni Association. "Al first, we 
ordered len, and those sold in iwo days. We ordered ten more, which sold 
in a week. This week we had fifteen, but almost half of those are spoken 

Fashion doll, dnniiuii: n.n&gt; Hue jnd &gt;\hnc ouiliu and pom-poms 
are on sale for S3S each in Keiiler 142. Buyers can choose from white or 
African' American dolls with blonde, auburn or black hair. All profils frorn 
the sale of the dolls fo mlo the N'fW Alumni A social ion's Scholarship 
Fund The dolls arc available only through the Alumni office at IPFW 

"They will only be a limned number of dolls available." said 
N'jncy Wuniiiw. secretary to Bosk 

Each of the outfits are hand-made by an IPFW alumnu. a 1995 
gradunle who goes by the name of Valance. 

"Nothing is exactly the same on |any one of] the dolls," said 
Valance, "so each outfit I sell is one-of-a-kind. 1 guess dial's how mine dif- 
fer from [the ones you can buy in a slote]— those arc mass-produced, 
whereas mine are sewn hy hand." 

Valance designed the outfits and created his own patiem. from 
which he produced Ihe clothing Tuelve-inch dolts are being dressed with 
the oulfils and sold as a complelc unit According to Valance, the clothes 
will fil any standard imKc-indi fj'.tu.m Jill Valance also pointed out that 
ihe outfiLs he produce-, are different from ihosc sold by oiher companies 
because his are made of douhle-knil ponte, a material used lo make 

Bosk is the one who originally came up wilh the idea after see- 



ing HJ and Purdue dolls on display in ihe olfiee ol one of her colleagues. 
"I thought, wouldn't ii be cute to have an IPFW doll .then I Ihought, well 
why nol*" She said thai the office has filled orders for alumni. student], 
faculty and staff, and people as far away as California. 

"Every dilTereni faC' 
lion has bought the dolls." she 

Chancellor Wancll

Anna Sevier, sccrclary

Fairchild says one of the aspects of his 
field thai he enjoys the most is asking peren- 
nial questions such as die meaning or life 
and ihe purpose of everyday existence. It is 
a qucslion thai every person is plagued wilh, 
according lo Fairchild As an undergraduate. 
Fairchild began studying theological ques- 
tions and die claws led him lo philosophy 
classes. Fairchild found philosophy to be 
more provocative and he changed his major. 

He has published five testbooks in the 
areas of logic and critical ihinking and has 
conducled numerous workshops on Ihe top- 
ics. He has wrillcn 40 papers and presenla- 
Uons that deal wilh gender sludics and per-

ance-enhancing anabolic sentrogemc 

Fairchild has been a member of PSSS.

1975. Fairchild has held every elective 
office in the association. This monih he fin- 
ished his tenth year as the society's first 
archivisi. In 1997, he won PSSS's distin- 
guished service award, which is similar to a 
lifetime achievement award, according id 
Fairchild. In addition to his studies and 
research. Fairchild has been an aclivc mem- 
ber of the campus community.

In regards lo IPFW. Fairchild said

Slim Shady album: 

Excellent beats despite obscene lyrics 



Anyone who knows anything about the modern- 
day mulic industry must surely remember Dr. Die's 
first solo effort after leaving ihc legendary N.W.A. Not 
only did it sell millions of copies and win two 
Grammys. but it also marked the premier of then 
utdcnosvn rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg. who would go 
on to cuual lame I., hi year, die sequel 10 Dr. Die's 
1993 solo album ssas released wilh another star, Slim 
Shady of ihe gtoup Lmincm. gaining fame for assist- 
ing Drc in the sune i ore 01 Aboui lire " As everyone 
knows, though, this wasn't Shady's debut. It wasn't 
100 far off, though. 

Slim Shady, whose real name is Marshall 
Mathers, released his first album 'The Slim Shady 
LP" in early 1999 alter Dr Drc signed him under his 
Aftermath Entertainment label. It was an instanl suc- 
cess, debuting at number thtce on the Billboard Alburn 
Chan with songs such as 'Ms Name Is" and the con- 
troversial ""97 Donme and Clyde" garnering il fame 
across ihe music industry. Now, scarcely a year later, 
Shady hopes lo repeal In. -uccess fiom ihe first album 
wilh a sequel. "The Marshall Mathers LP" 

In his new album. Shady combined the musical 
style that makes Drc albums best sellers with his own 
unique style of rapping 10 produce an end result that 
just doesn't go over well with me, despite my usually 
liking alliums I )i Die helps produce Shady Mill works 
some humor into his work though none of his new 
songs come across with the same comedic value as 
"My Name Is." Shady does mix in a couple or skits 
that were somewhat humorous, bul not much to make 
the average listener laugh. 

purchasing 
album Imping 
going 10 be a st 
of songs like "My 
Name Is" should 
probably save their 
money. 

Those look- 
ing for quality in

disappointed. 
Following the lega-

lyrics in his songs 
that may offend 

Perhaps the two 



best samples ol this can be found in the songs "Kill 
You" and "Kim." These lyrics, of course, can'i be 
primed in this forum, but they can be summarized. 
"Kill You" can basically be destined as a four and a 
ball minute death threat, colored wilh obscenities and 
"Kim" is a violent rant directed towards: Mathers' ex- 
wife. 

Regardless of why he chose 10 include the Inner 
on the album, I have lo disagree wilh its inclusion, it 
really took me out of the album, which 1 didn't think 
was all that bad until hearing thai song Songs like 
"Kim" and "Kill You" make this album far from being 
suitable for children. 

Whal the album does contain, though, i

"The Way I Am," "Who Knew." "Amilyvillc" and 
"Under The Influence" are great tongs to dance 10 as 
well.

Division I commentary 



Even though die Purdue president has not given 
his approval ami the 1PI"VY faculty senate has not made 
its recommendation, by June 1, IPFW officials plan on 
informing ihe NCAA whether or not it will move from 
Division II id Division I By informing the NCAA, Ihe 
Mastodons would be able to apply for an exemption to 
the NCAA's recently imposed two-year 
accepting. Dm. urn I applications The 
June I rush is because IPFW can still wit 
cation for Division 1 within one year, 
June 1. However, if IPFW fails lo 
meel the deadline, it would have to 
wait two years before even being 
allowed lo apply. 

According to IPFW faculty 
senate member and political science 
pm lessor Mike tJouns, "The senate 
svill decide In September whether or 
not 10 Support a move 10 Division [." 
( ins- miehl wonder why tin i&gt;piiiii.ni 
of Ihe faculis an J the Purdue inci- 
dent matter if IPFW has already 
decided Out it is going Divisinn ! 
1PE-1V Chancellor Michael W.uiell 
can still proceed with the [)i visum i 
status without Ihe decision of IPFW 
faculty; however, he requests the 
support of ihc faculty and students. 
According to current Purdue President Steven C. 
Deenng, IPFW must have his support lo go Division i. 
Wan ell must forward, his decision to ihe prcsidem of 
Purdue since Purdue oversees IPFW. 

Not everyone is pleased with IPFW's debate on 
whether or not lo notify Ihe NCAA lhal ihcy wish lo 
change their cb"iikariun &lt; ine primp dial is complain- 
ing is the Great Lakes Valley Conference. IPFW's ath-

and expenses of S3. 430,000.

The trials of nitle IX 



In lap 69 of the Indianapolis 
500, (he only two female drivers to 
qualify collided in a lum. Sarah 
Fisher sent Lyn St. James into the 
wall. Many questioned if Fisher 
should have been driving in the first 
place since she is only 19 and was 
racing againsi people in their thir- 
ties One person who vchemendy 
questioned her driving skills was 
former Indy racer and current car 
owner A.l. Foyt. In all fairness, 
one should not judge Foyt harsh- 
ly because when he started rac- 
ing, women were not allowed io 
scl foot in Gasoline Alley, let 
alone drive a racecar It was not 
until Congress passed Title DC 
and outer gender equality laws 
that women were allowed lo par- 
ticipate in sports traditionally 

Title IX is the most contro- 
versial subject facing intercolle- 
giate and high school aibleiics 
today. There is a great emphasis 
on enforcing the iwenty-eight 
year old legislation due to the fact 
that, as we speak, ninety percent 
of American universities are nol in 
compliance with the federal laws 
Tweniy-five years ago. Congress 
developed Tttlc IX because of Ihc 
gross inequities in college sports.

has helped improve female partici- 
pation in athleucj at .ill levels When 
Tide IX was passed in 1972. then: 
were fewer than 32,000 women 
competing in intercollegiate athlet- 




ics, according to an Associate J Pre-- 
article. According lo ihe NCAA, 
female athletes were receiving pu»i 
two percent of all monies and none 
of ihat was in ihe form of scholar- 
ships. Today more lhan 110,000 
women participate in college spons 
The number of female athletes in 
high school has increased from 
aboul 300.000 to 2.13 million, 



However, die cost of women's par- 

ticipaiion has been the reduction ol 

male sports. 

This is one reason why NCAA 

Division 1 women's basketball teams 

have 13 scholarships available and 

ihe men's team has 13.

Government officials who 
enforce Tide IX say thai ihc rights of 
women lo participate in college 
sports outweigh Ihe rights of indi-

their hands are lied by financial con-
