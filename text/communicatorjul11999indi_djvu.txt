River City Chorus performs first in POPS line-up 



by CarrieAnne Leathers, 
News Editor 



River Ciiy Rhythm sang barbershop 
favorites and other pop classics to communii&gt; 
member'; K.ithrrcd outside Walb Union last 




Ffiole bv CamtArri! Le, 



Members of River City Rhythm formed the 
group only a few years ago because they 
wanted to sing a larger variety of music at 
a more serious level. 



Sunda&gt;. The performance svas the 
first in the iPFW Performance on 
the Plaza Series (POPS) put on b&gt; 
the School of Fine and Performing 
Arts and Universitj- Relations and 
Communications. 

"We were just thrilled with the 
idea of creating POPS because there 
reall) isn't a whole lot fioin^ on 
during the summer," said Kaicy 
Houston, marketing and public 
relations specialist for the school of 
fine and performing arts. 

Brainstorming for the creation 
of POPS began in early spring and 
it was not until recentl&gt;' that thi.' 
three planned performances were 
finalized. 

"River Citj- Rhythm performed 
out of courtesy to us and did an 
excellent job," said Houston. "And 
the crowd was more than we had 
expected for the first performanre 
in the series." 

River Cit&gt;' Rhythm was formed 
only a few &gt;e3rs ago after members 
of the Summit Cit&gt;' Chorus decided 
thej wanted to sing on a more seri- 
ous le\el and also attempt material 
besides barbershop tunes. 

"The men who formed Ri\er 
City Rhythm wanted to sing more From left 
seriously and take it to another 
level." said Dan Johnson of Ri\er 
City Rhythm. 

Besides just the music of River City 
Rhythm at Sunday's POPS, four members of 
the group sang after the conclusion of River 
City Rhythm's material in a barbershop quartet 
stj'le. The four men enjoy singing in quartet 
st&gt;'le and have performed for other events in 
the area under the group's name. Crossfire. 

"When you get four voices locked and 
going, it's like nothing you've ever heard or 
experienced," said Matt Milton, bass singer and 
temporarj' member of the group. 

Upcoming performances in POPS include 




to right, Paul Gabriel, Dan Johnson, Jeff Goshorn, and MaW l\/lilton sing 
barbershop quartet style as an addition to the River City Rhythm's regular show. 



the Fort Wayne Community Band performance 
and ice cream social on July 12 at 6:30 p.m. 
This annual Three Rivers Festival event is also 
a part of FOPS this year. 

On July 25, the New Millennium jazz 
ensemble will perform on the east side on Walb 
Union at 7 p.m. 

"We hope that the jazz ensemble will be 
verj' successful in bringing out new listeners." 
said Houston. 

Houston is also seeking to find one more 
group to perform for POPS in August. 



"This is the first season we have done this, 
but as we get better at it and get more experi- 
ence at it. we hope that it will grow and 
become something that people will look for- 
ward to ever&gt;' year," said Houston. 

River Cit)' Rhythm is also looking for men 
to join the group. Area singers interested 
should contact the group's director, Pat 
Garmier, after 5 p.m. at 625-5153. For booking 
information, contact Mark Bonahoom at 471- 
2724. 



Summer camps share I PFW's resources with community 



by OarrleAnne Leathers, 
News Editor 



Area students can once again par- 
ticipate in IPFW's summer camps in 
order to entertain and enrich them- 
selves in the areas of music, science, 
mathematics, and athletics. 

"The main purpose of holding 
summer camps at IPFW is to get kids 
into campus and let them see what 
IPFW has to offer." said Alice Alesia, 
communications specialist in 
Universit)' Relations. 

The camps include a medical 
career science program; piano instruc- 
tion, both regular and Suzuki style; 
golf instruction; drum camp; strings 
camp; math and science camp and vol- 
leyball camps, 



By providing summer camps to 
area students, IPFW helps the youth to 
stay active and intellectually chal- 
lenged while school is out for 
the summer. 

Students are able to spend learn- 
ing time on activities that interest 
them in a setting that provides in- 
depth treatment of the subject matter. 
The camps also gi\e the universitj a 
chance to share information with area 
students. 

"The departments do these to get 
out into the communitj. This is just 
communitj' outreach, not fundraising," 
Alesia said. "We want to expose kids to 
some of the things available to them at 
IPFW and then maj be later they will 
consider IPFW for their college choice." 

Opportunities for indi%'idual or 
group learning and activities are avail- 
able depending on the different 
camps.

Recent open house at Gates Sports Center 
attracts newcomers from campus and community 



by CarrieAnne Leathers, 
News Editor 



Students, facultj- and communitj' members attended 
the Gates Sports Center Open House on June 23 to tour the 
facilities, use equipment, and compete with other visitors 
and Sports Center users in fitness level tests. 

"The open house is an opportunity we offer three 
times a year at the beginning of the fall semester, the 
beginning of the winter semester and once during the sum- 
mer." said Judy Tiltapaugh, fitness and wellness coordina- 
'. tor for IPFW. "Our main hope is to attract new fitness cen- 




ter members as well as to show appreciation for our cur- 
rent members." 

A drawing for prizes was also held and free food and 
refreshments were offered throughout the day. 

"Students and facult&gt; on campus that haven't discov- 
ered us jet had a chance to come and check us out. Also, 
any community member could have come in and done a 
walk through to check out all the fitness opportunities at 
Gates," said Tillapaugh. 

Fitness challenges included the bench press 
endurance, the push-up test, and the two-mile prediction. 

Kyle Kracher won the bench press of 100 pounds for 
the men, completing 110 bench presses, Pam Joachin won 
for the women with 100 bench presses of the 45-pound 
bar. Tim Huber won the push-up test, completing 90 push- 
ups in 60 seconds and Star Warnsley completed 26 push- 
ups in 60 seconds, winning the women's push-up 
competition. 

In the t\vo-mile prediction, participants had to guess 
how long it would take to run two miles and then see how 
close they could come to running it in that time, without 
watching the clock, Shenvin Kepes. a psychology professor 
at IPFW. won the two-mile prediction in the men's competi- 
tion, being only se\'en seconds off from his prediction. 
Maggie Curtis *von for the women's two-mile prediction 
competition, only 13 seconds off from her prediction. 
Overall. Tillapaugh belie\es the open house went well, 

"We defmitelj had a steady stream of people coming 
in through the daj' enjoying the facilities," Tillapaugh said. 
"We are also going to be getting air conditioning in the 
next fe^v weeks and we are all definitelj looking forward to 
that. Ihat svill make a big difference and will help to make 
people feel more comfortable as thej' work out and also 
staj' better hydraied." 

The Gates Sports Center is open six days a week, 
Monday through Thursdaj . 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Fridajs 6 a.m. 
to 7 p.m. and Saturdajs 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. for students and 
facultj to use free of charge. Communitj members inter- 
ested in purchasing a membership should call Tillapaugh

Updated law on access to public records effectiv 

,._-......, I-L.i- ■ r I. . In Ant-il lOOO co.un lnHL-in-&lt; n^,., t ^..r,^.-r ^^i™«, J .l._I 



WHAT WE THINK: TTie law has been revised and 
those wtio worti in public offices should no kinger 
deny Hoosiers public records. 

WHAT DO YOU THINK? Send your e-mail response 
10 stupaper@tiolmes.ipfw.edu or a letter lo Walb 215. 




In April 1998 seven Indiana newspapers 
conducted an investigation that tested open 
access laws. 

Ttie journalists went to public organiza- 
tions such as stieriff departments, public 
sctiools and healtti departments to request 
records such as death certificates, school board 
meeting minutes and crime logs. 

The Indiana code does not require idendfi- 
caiion; however, a photo ID was requested from 
the journalists who, when posing as 
"regular citizens," were sometimes 
harassed and questioned. 

Thej also found the cop&gt;ing costs in some 
places to be overpriced to the point where it 
was too e,\pensi\e to obuln a record. 

Overall, they found the task of gaining 
access to records to be extremelj difficult. 

Citizens' rights are violated and the law is 
broken when public records are not released. 
According to the newspapers' investigations, 
those who denied Hoosiers public records faced 
little or no consequences. 

The Communicator admires the work of 
everyone who helped conduct this 
investigation. 

Thanks to the results of their work, the 
General Assembly decided to review the 
Indiana Code on open access laws. Today, a 
revision of the law will go into effect. 

The updated code created an open access 
counselor to deal with all the technicalities that 
in\'Olve accessing records. 

Now, those who do not allow citizens to 
have access to public records can be fined for 
their actions.. 

We don't understand why those who 
worked in public offices created obstacles for 
citizens who wanted public records. Was there 
something to hide? 

How will Hoosiers know what's going on 
around them if they are left in the dark about 



crimes or deaths? 

One of the newspapers illustrated a prime 
example of what can happen when citizens 
can't view records. 

A local newspaper in Gary- wanted to print 
a map where rapes had taken place. This infor- 
mation would have helped the citizens know if 
they were in an area where additional rapes 
might occur. 

Unfortunatelj access to addresses of vic- 
tims was denied because it was ruled that the 
information invaded the privacy of the victim. 

The paper did not want to publish victims' 
names, ages or se\ in accordance with the law, 
just the locations where the crimes occurred. 
The rapes continued and no one was caughL 

The information maj have helped the peo- 
ple In Gao ■ The criminal was helped instead. 

Hopefully, the new code will help citizens 
find what they maj have been looking for. 

Today. Hoosiers should not get harassed, 
be o\ercharged or asked for their 
identification. 

Today, the people in this state should be 
able to walk out the door with a document, not 
a headache. 

According to the investigation, Indiana has 
always had a problem with open records. 

To those of &gt;ou who work in public offices 
please let the citizens view public records. 

It is their right to know. 

We hope that this is truly a step in the 
right direction in the enforcement of this law, 
and we commend those that helped make it 

possible. 

For more detailed information about the 
investigations or to view the new code, check 
out the Muncie Starpress on-line or visit the 
web site of the Indiana General Assembly.

Managing Editor 




Young Jane is a little girl, approximatelj i- 
5 years old, wearing a white T-shirt and pink 
shorts. She has a big smile on her face as her 
pig tails bob up and down while riding atop her 
father's shoulders. 

It is quite apparent the young lady is hav- 
ing a blast. In the meantime, with Jane on his 
shoulders, dad is engaging in a phone call. After 
finishing the phone call, dad rushes through a 
main aisle towards the door. Jane is still on his 
shoulders. 

Then out of nowhere, a loud hollow "gonk," 
spreads throughout the building. 

Starded people across the room of the pub- 
lic place look up. They wonder if Jane is all 
right. 

I am acquainted with some of the individu- 
als who know dad and I proceed to inquire 
about Jane's head. 

"'Dan' is a great father and it happens all 
the time. Don't lose any sleep over it," said one 
individual. 

"She's not your kid, so don't worry about 
it," someone else chimed in. 

I have not lost any sleep over this incident I 
recently witnessed. Instead. I have discovered 
how calloused and careless people have become 
toward children. 

1 am not i parent. I'm too young, have too 
much college to finish and I'm too single. 

However, I have been a kid. I do remember 
mj' mother getting quite upset if my brother or 
I hit our heads. 

I don't know anything about dad and I am 
not to'ing to imply that he is a "bad" parenL I 
believe he should be more careful. 

Pain is not something people or any other 
animals enjoy. It is not in our nature. 

Jane probabl&gt; does not cry because it is a 
usual occurrence. If getting a konk on the head 
is oka)' with dad then ft will probably be okay 
with Jane. 

She is learning the rules of society. When 
one is called an animal, that person takes the 
comment as an insult. I believe we are becoming 
worse than animals. Animals don't repeatedly 
cause injuo' to their children, at least not widi- 
out a good reason. 

This incident is considered mild. I'm sure 
many of you have seen or heard of cases 
involved with children that are much worse 
than this one. 

What happened to jane, happens to chil- 
dren all over the world. 

I wish people could understand that kids 
have feelings too and that they are the future. 1 
believe people should give them more compas- 
sion, dignity and respecL

There was a time when one of the most Now that we've covered, 

important things parents were supposed to over-tipping and non-tip 

teach their kids was good manners. There was ping, let's turn our attention 

a time when it was considered impolite not to to the bulk of patrons 




Common sense alone 
should tell us that some 
people don't tip simply 
because they can't afford 
to.

speak when you were spoken to. 

There was a time when "thank you" went 
with "please" and "j ou're welcome" went with 
"thank )ou." 

I realize that good manners and commu- 
nication skills should start in the home and at 
an early age, but that is not the subject I wish 
to discuss, let us, for now, focus on the matter 
at hand: The ser\ice industry is overwhelmed 
with incompetent, unfriendly, poorlj -trained 
individuals who have no more business work- 
ing with the public than Clinton has teaching 
a course in ethics. 

Although there are exceptions to the rule, 
far too manj people who work with the public 
have bad manners and little or no people 
skills. I don't know what kind of training pro- 
grams businesses offer for new employees 
(though 1 know from experience that many 
places have no training program), but it seems 
to me that friendliness and common decency 
for other human beings are not requirements 
for getting or keeping a Job these days. 

Do businesses todaj e\en realize that 
their employees are their business? If business 
A and business B both sell great steak dinners 
(or cocktails or burgers...) at a comparable 
price, don't owners and managers realize 
that, for many people, it is the atmosphere 
that will be the deciding factor on where to 
eat, A or B? If employees aren't part of the 
atmosphere, then what are they? 

There was a lime when 1 over-tipped in 
bars and restaurants no matter what the ser- 
vice. I've worked in the industry for over ten 
years and I can tell you that over-tipping is 
common practice among most people who 
rely heavily on gratuity for a significant por- 
bon of their income. 

I always made excuses for the mediocre 
or bad service I received and was polite to my 
sen'er no matter what their mood. 

Were the industo not so Hooded with 
unfriendly, incompetent servers, 1 would 
probabl) still be "unfairlj generous." As it is, I 

prefer to dine and drink at home where I'm ed gratuity was fifteen 
always sure to be nice to myself and serve percent. How interest 
myselfwell. ing the government 

I say "unfairly generous" because it isn't feels it's their nght 
fair, in theory or in practice, to tip a bad or get more of the tii 
mediocre server the same amount that you 
would tip a good server: Not only does the 
better ser\'er deserve the better tip, but the 
poor server has no motivation to give better 
service if the customer over-tips no matter 
what kind of ser\ ice he recei\es. 

It maj surprise some of you to know that 
there are patrons who 
never tip, regardless of 

the quality of the ser- Unsigned editorials a 

vice they receive. This do not necesiarlly retlect 
is to be expected since dent body, a column ii »oi 
tips are defined as a 
small gift (therefore not 
a requirement) of , 
money in recognition of 
services rendered. Some , 
people feel that it is not ,

that has long been , 
known for its ridicu- 
lously low wages. '

means is that e\er&gt;

luxury of pavmg the

leave a tip or not

The next time I 
you see a server 



appears to be a 
generous tip, keep 
in mind all the fact: 




There is one other 
breed of under-tippers 
ihJi we have &gt;et to men- 
tiun and it is not in this 
I ategorj that I h3\e 
recenti) found myself. 
Some people 
actuallj use the sys- 
tem of gratuity to 
send important 
messages to their 
erver. 

lecause of the things 

that 1 ha\e covered up to this point 

and for manj other reasons that I just 

don't have the space for, over-tipping for 

inadequate serx ice seems illogical to me and 

1 Just can't get mj self to do it an&gt;more. 

The service industry . Service. The occu- 
pation of being a servant. To be good at it, 
jou have to be willing to work like a dog, bite 
&gt;our tongue more than you'd like to, work 
long and odd hours, be friendly to people j ou 
don't know, look good, be happy, and most 
importantlj be clairvoyant. 

You maj wind up in the industry tem- 
porarily, possiblj because bar and restaurant 
work can be more flexible than most other 
|obs and students tend to gravitate toward 
fiexible work schedules. If you do, don't forget 
vour manners. 

Be friendly and helpful when you can and" 
go that extra mile 

Treat everyone you meet the way you 
would like to be treated (I'm not preaching, 
I'm pleading): Not only do you stand a better 
chance of making the maximum tip, jou help 
create a warm inviting atmosphere and can 
take pride in the fact that you are truly doing 
the best job possible. 

I commend those in the industry who 
work hard at being good at what they do. This 
is no easy task, especially in today's over- 
crowded, under-satisfied, "gotta have it now 
and it better be good " world. 

Don't let an) one convince you that the 
service industrj can do its job and do it well 
with the use of unskilled labor. That's the 
problem with the industry: Business owners 
and managers don't seem lo comprehend the 
fact that it takes a great deal of skill to work 
well with the public. 

If j'ou're in the business or are planning 
to be, do those of us w ho "go the extra mile" a 
favor and be good at what j ou do. 

Each of us is a reflection on the other and 
we need all the positive image we can geL

Due to an agreement with 
Fort Wayne, Police and Safety 
can also make arrests within 
the city. 

Some of the sen ices they 
provide are the unlocking of 
car doors, escorts to automo- 
biles and engravings of identi- 
fication numbers on personal 
items. 

As well as keeping the 
campus safe, there are 
approximately twelve full- 
time groundskeepers at the 
Physical Plant who are respon- 
sible for maintaining scenerj' 
and campus vehicles. 

"We take care of flower 
beds, trees, shrubs and athlet- 
ic fields. Groundskeepers 
sweep the streets, keep the 
parking lot clean, fertilize the 
plant life and distribute pesti- 
cides and herbicides," said 
Danielson. 

Groundskeepers are also 
responsible for all outdoor 
signs. The&gt; maintain all the 
universitj fleet, and any 
machine thej' use while work- 
ing outside such as lawn mow- 
ers, trucks, tractors and snow 
blowers, said Danielson, 

During the summer, more 
help is needed outside. There 
are a few students who help 
full-time groundskeepers in 
the summer. 

"1 like working outside 
instead of inside. It's summer 
time and people should go 
outside and enjoy the weath- 
er," said Andrew Teel, one of 
the summer helpers in the 
grounds department. "I attend 
iU Bloomington. This helps 
pay for the books and 
tuition." 

While groundskeepers 
take care of the exterior of 
IPFW, maintenance persons 
care for the interior of IPFW. 

The operations crew is 
made up of 15 people who 
work from 3 to 11:30 p.m.

Recovering a piece of Fort Wayne's past 



by Adam Taylor, 
Edflor 



Growing up in Fort 
Wayne, many might recall 
memories of visiting the Old 
Tort as either pnrt of a school 
fiGld irip or as a family ouiing. 

With the closing of the 
Fori to the public in 1993, 
these memories seemed to be 
as lost in history as the histo- 
ry of the Fort Itself. Until 
recently, the Fort has seen 
verj' few signs of life. 

Working in conjunction 
with Parks and Recreations, a 
group of volunteers has been 
attempting to restore the Fort 
to its original state in order to 
have it open to the public 
once again in the near future. 

"It's undergoing renova- 
tion and stabilization," said 
Philip Bennett. Superintendent 
of Leisure Services. "In other 
words, the)-'re replacing the 
logs and treating the rest so 
that they don't rot." 

Spearheading the project 
is Sara Thena, Supervisor of 
Athletics and Special Events 
for Parks and Recreations, 
who said the log stabilization 
project is just one part of what 
they're doing to the Fort to 
get it open once again for the 
general public. 

Thena says most of the 
work is being handled by a 
group of re-enactors working 
for Parks and Recreations. 
"We have a group of re-enac- 
lors doing the work." Thena 
said. "They're the First U.S. 
Light Ariilleo'. 1812 Division, 



and they've been doing a lot 
of work there, repairing bro- 
ken glass and whatever." 

Thena said they have big 
plans under »vay. in terms of 
renovations o\'er the next 
year. 

"We're working on 
putting in herb gardens," she 
said. "Right now we're work- 
ing on getting the forge and 
wood smith shop up and run- 
ning again." 

Resurfacing the parade 
grounds and working on the 
bake oven are also on the 
agenda for Thena and her 
crew. 

They also plan on resur- 
facing the roof, among other 
things. 

"We're building real shut- 
ters on the windows so lhe&gt; 
can take off the pl&gt;ivood," she 
said. "The renovations will 
probably take most of the fall 
and winter, then in the spring 
we're going to put up the 
stockade." 

Plans to build an on-site 
museum are also being 
worked on. 

Thena said that, once 
open, the Fort will portray the 
same time period it did before 
closing in 1993. 

According to Randy 
Elliott, registrar at the Allen 
County— Fort Wayne Historical 
Museum with eight years 
experience in working at the 
Fori, this would have been the 
endof theWarof 1812. 

"k portrayed the Summer 
of 1816, basically," Elliott 
said. "It was open from mid- 
April to the end of October 




July 17 and 18 will find these buildings full ot people, both re-enactors and the public. 



with a Christmas event and 
special programming in 

November. It closed in 
October 1993 due to lack of 
monej to operate." 

From there it was trans- 
ferred to the city in 1994, 
where it was assigned to Parks 
and Recreation, 

The restoration is being

funded by the city as well as 
private donations, the largest 
coming from Chem Waste 

Management, 

According to Thena, the 
Fort should be open to the 
public on a regular basis 
sometime next year, although 
not seven days a week as it 
was before. 

In the meantime, the&gt; 
have been having re-enact- 
ments of life at the Fort once a 
month since April. 

The next planned re- 
enactment will be on Jul)' 17 
and 18 from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 

Called "Life at the Old 
Fort," the re-enactment will be 
comprised of performers in 
period dress discussing life at 
the Fort in the eariy 1800s. 

The re-enactment will 
also include a simulated battle 



In which Indians attack the 
Fort and the garrison inside 
the Northwest Blockhouse 
fights them off. 

Following "Life at the Old 
Fort," Thena and company 
plan to get back to work on 
the restoration. 

"As soon as the July event 
is over, we will be starting a 
campaign to get donations to 
re-roof the buildings," Thena 
said. "At S40 a square yard, a 
person can purchase a shingle 
and have their name put on a 
plaque that will hang in the 
museum." 

People interested in pur- 
chasing a shingle are encour- 
aged to call Thena at 427- 
6003. 

With all of the construc- 
tion going on at the Fort it 
m'ay seem as though It' will be 



a long time until things are 
finally back to normal. 

However, the public is 
encouraged to be patient as 
the symbol of the communi- 
ty's heritage is slowly being 
restored to top condition-.' 

Every step forward is a 
step toward the finish.

In ihe capitalist countr&gt;' 
in which we live, it is hard to 
imagine good food with a rea- 
sonable price. 

It Is additionally more 
difficult to find inexpensive 
Chinese food that is good as 
well. 

This certainly isn't the 
case, as ! recently found out, 
in the Pesona restaurant, 
located above the Regencj' Inn 
office on West Coliseum. 

Pesona is a family-operat- 
ed restaurant that is still a 
fledgling, having opened up 
just weeks ago. The familj 
that runs the restaurant, how- 
ever, seems to have a good 
grasp on what makes restau- 
rants run well. 

They not only serve 
Chinese food but American 
and Indonesian food as well, 
with Indonesian being their 
specialt) (the family is origi- 
nall&gt; from Indonesia). 

According to the manager 
I talked to, the variance in 
tjpes of food is used to attract 
different types of people. 

For example, the 
Indonesian food is for people 
that like really spicy food and 
want to tr&gt;' something new. 

The Chinese food is for 
people that basically enjoy 
Chinese food. 

The American food, how- 



ever. Is targeted to the restau- 
rant's most probable crowd- 
occupants of the Regencj- Inn. 

Knowing that not every- 
one staying at the Inn has a 
taste for something new, the 
owners decided lo put more 
common food, like hamburg- 
ers and hot dogs, on the 
menu. 

My trip to Pesona was a 
very pleasurable one. 

I was greeted by the man- 
ager of the establishment 
upon my arrival and was 
shown to a table where he 
joined me for lunch. 

This is not the standard 
procedure, I might add. 

He knew I was there with 
a special intent and wished to 
tell me as much as he could. 

I started off bj splitting 
an Indonesian dish comprised 
of chicken and chili sauce 
(among various vegetables) 
with my host. 

Unfortunately, this item 
is not included among the 
ones on the menu, but it was 
ver&gt;' good. 

It was served with rice, 
which the manager said tones 
down the spiciness of the dish. 

Spicy is a good word for 
it because I almost Immediate- 
ly broke into a sweat upon 
tasting it. 

While we ate, 1 took the 
opportunic&gt;' to not only talk 
to the manager about the 
restaurant, but also to observe 
the setting. 



The restaurant, being run 
by a family, has a definite 
family atmosphere that is 
reflective of not only the peo- 
ple that run it, but its hours of 
operation. 

Pesona is open from 7 
a.m. to 9 p.m. dailj-, isolating 
the night crowd and focusing 
on the times that most fami- 
lies can get out and get some- 
thing to eat. 

It basically has a diner 
feel to it to me, reminding me 
of a place I used to eat in 
Bluffton. 

A different t&gt; pe of people 
frequents this establishment, 
however, making it seem like 
a good place to take &gt;our kids. 

The next item 1 tried was 
an item from the Indonesian 
part of the menu called Mie 
rebus Kering. 

This is basically egg noo- 
dles served with liny (though 
abundant) pieces of either 
chicken or pork and some 
tj'pe of broth soup. 

I had the chicken, which 
to me was an excellent deci- 
sion because it ended up 
being ver&gt; delicious. 

It only cost S3. 50, too, 
which definitely added to m&gt; 
enjoyment of the meal. 

It probabl&gt; wouldn't have 
mattered what 1 ordered, 
though, since the meals range 
from $1.50 for three pieces of 
ham (a breakfast item) to $6 
for items with shrimp in them

Do you want some sum- 
mer fun? If so, then cram a 
few friends into a car and r^ce 
o\er to "Notting Hill," a witt&gt;' 
romance currentl&gt; pla&gt;ing at 
the movies. Richard Curtis of 
"Four Weddings and a 
Funeral" and the Mr. Bean 
television series has written 
another winner in this sum- 
mer comed&gt; . 

Julia Roberts' mega-star 
image is perfectly cast as an 
American actress. Anna Scott, 
who is in London to promote 
her latest sci-fi mo\ie. She 
makes the most of her million 
dollar smile and it's easy to 
forgive her lack of perfor- 
mance elsewhere as the part 
only allows a stretch in a 
scene or t\vo. But who cares? 
She's as perfect as she's sup- 
posed to be. 



Hugh Grant plays a char- 
acter much like his previous 
roles in the part of ordinary 
guy William Thacker. William 
is an honest ind just plain 
nice man whose unprepossess- 
ing manner attracts Anna just 
as Notting Hill draws her awaj 
from her opulent life at the 
Ritz. Brave enough to ask, 
William takes Anna as his date 
to his ditsy sister's birthda&gt; 
part). 

Unlike "You've Got Mail" 
where the stars cany the show 
on their own, director Roger 
Michell has gathered a verj 
talented ensemble to comple- 
ment the script. The&gt; make 
the most of even a few lines 
and de\'elop William's friends 
into people who would enliven 
and enrich anj neighborhood. 

Best among them is Rhj s 
Ifans who plays Spike, 
William's Welsh flat mate. 
From the mat of his hair to his 
choice of dress to the soles of 
his feet, Spike could have 



stolen the show if it weren't 
for the other big name stars. 
Of course he had a very funnj 
script and goggles to work 
with.'' . . ■ - 

The stockbroker without 
a clue, the American 
bo&gt; friend and the best- 
friends-stJll-in-!ove aspects of 
this movie also deserve men- 
tion as well. 

I would have liked to seen 
more of Notting Hill under- 
lined as a character. That is 
perhaps too much to expect of 
this genre, although, to give 
credit to Michell, those scenes 
were probably left on the cut- 
ting room floor. Luckil) a 
lovelj-iime sequence did 
su^^'ive. 

The tale is not the "if of 
Anna and William's romance 
but the "how." The laughs 
with ) our friends and those of 
)Our significant other's make 
"Netting Hill" a charming 
place to Hnd lasting love and 
summer fun.

menu. The menu is subject to 
change in the future, however, 
with a new menu coming out 
next week. The prices more 
than likel) won't change, 
though, nor will the overall 
qualit) of the food. 

The onl&gt;' thing I found 
that could use a little work 
was the general atmosphere. 

It seemed to be lacking in 
that there was a television on 
in the main dining area, which 
is something I don't normall) 
see in restaurants. 

Another thing I didn't 
reallj' like was that the place 
seemed bare. 

I understand that the 
restaurant just opened recent- 
ly, though, so I can sj mpa- 
thize with this. 

Despite these minor 
points, though, overall, I was 
very pleased with what the 
restaurant had to offer. 

The people were friendly, 



the food was good, and most 
of all. it was easj' enough on 
mj' wallet to make me want to 
go back again. 

If &gt; ou're ever out on West 
Coliseum and &gt;ou're hungrj , 
i ou ma&gt; want lo pull in lo the 
Regency Inn parking lot and 
head up to Pesona. 

I can almost guarantee 
that &gt;ou'U want to go back for 
more.

much anticipation for season to begin 



The Communicator Page 6 



by Brian Miller, 
Sports Editor 



Whik- ihore have been 
many improvements and ren- 
ovations done in almost ever&gt;' 
building here at JI'FW. some of 
the most signiTicant changes 
on campus have been the hir- 
ing and firing that has 
occurred in the Athletic 
Administration. 

Since the reign of Athletic 
Director Walter Bowman, just 
about cverj' coaching position 
has been replaced. 

The women's softball 
team has seen three coaches 
in the last three seasons with 
Dina Zahm recently named 
new head sofiball coach. 



Zahm participated in the 
Great Lakes Women's Baseball 
League as a pitcher and out- 
fielder on the Fort Wayne 
"Phantom's" in 1997. 

Prior to her appointment 
as head softball coach, Zahm 
began her coaching career at 
IPFW as an assistant in 1998. 

The softball team is not 
the only team that has a 
vacancy. Judy Tillapaugh, for- 
mer cross country coach, 
received a promotion to 
Director of Wellness and 
Fitness at the Gates Center. 

That paved the road for 
Robert Waterson to step up as 
head coach of both the men's 
and women's cross countrj' 
teams. 

Waterson has competed

ing fonvard to sharing some 
of his experiences with the 
team. 

Also recently hired was

uate of Defiance College, will

responsibilities of fine tuning

flow smoothly.

Vittorio will begin his 
dream of coaching at the

Gisslen to run offense 
on volleyball roster 
for Team USA 



by Brian Miller, 
Sports Editor 

The IndiJna Purdue men's vol- 
leyball team has already accom- 
plished more than even Coach I 
Amle Ball could expect, all in onl&gt; 
a few months of time. | 

With past accolades tha 
include an MIVA Co-Championship I 
and a 1999 Men's Volleyball Final I 
Four berth, an individual team I 
member now has the presitigious I 
honor of putting on a Team USA | 
jersey. 

Ball has already had the privi- 
lege of seeing his son wear the jersey and now will be able to see 
yet another "Volleydon" gear up in the red, white and blue uni- 
form. 

This past week, USA Voile) ball announced the 12-man col- 
legiate volleyball roster that will represent the United States in 
Palma De Mallorca, Spain, at the World Uni%ersit)' Games. 

The team will be coached by legend Al Scates, who holds 
man&gt; men's volleyball coaching records. The team will consist 
of seven American VolIe&gt;ball Coaches. Association Ail- 
Americans. 

Joining Gisslen on the Team USA roster is a pair of two-time 
First Team honorees Brandon Taliaferro and Adam Nae\e of 
UCLA. The roster also includes first-timers Reid Pridd) (Lo)Ola 
Man mount), Donnie Rafter (UCIr\ine), And) Witt (Stanford), 
Scott Wong (Pepperdine), Gabriel Gardner (Stanford). Michael 
Rupp (UC lr^■ine), Clay Stanlej (Hawaii), Thomas Stillwell 
(UCIA) and Mac Wilson (BYU), 

Gisslen's job will be to run the offense for Team USA. 
Sounds like an awful tough task but Gisslen will be well 
equipped. Gisslen understands the importance of his setter 
position and has been setting balls to Ail-American Hector Soto 
and All-MIVA hitters Scott Lane and Jeff Ptak. 

The squad will continue training at the U.S. Oljmpic 
Training Center in San Diego before departing to Spain.
