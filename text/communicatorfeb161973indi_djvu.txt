Dear Editor: 

I have found that most peo- 
ple have to have something 
to complain about In order 
to be happy. If they don't 
have a topic from their Im- 
mediate life, they stick 
their noses Into someone 
elses. I am referlng to 
those who are unhappy with 
the decision of the Supreme 
Court to legalize abortion. 
If some people want the 
right to have an abortion 
when they need it, they 
should have it. So, it is

against some people's 
moral judgements, so what. 
Your moral judgements 
aren't necessarily accept- 
ed world wide, and who are 
you to tell others whatthey 
may or may not do with 
their body or any part of 
their body. And, let's face 
it, as long as an embryo is 
connected to the mother's 
body, getting nourishment 
from the mother, it is still 
part of someone else, to 
do with as she pleases. 

Let's look at the situation 
from another point of view. 
Most people preach free- 
dom and equal rights. Yet, 
when you want to forbid the 



right to legal abortion, you 
are taking away another 
p e r s o n*s freedom. The 
freedom to lead an un- 
hampered life from a child 
that is not wanted. What is 
worse, to take away a child 
before it Js born and can 
feel pain, or to force a child 
to live a miserable life in a 
home where It is not want- 
ed. 

The court's decision was 
for the benefit of those who 
want or need the service. 
It does not force those who 
don't believe in the prac- 
tice to use it. So, let others 
lead their own life and you 
lead yours.

character &amp; opinion 



For some time now the 
issue of equality has 
plagued us until we have 
in many respects come to 
believe equality is neces- 
sary. To extend this, one 
might Indeed ask if equal- 
ity, at least the social- 
economic eqalitarlan brand 
we hear so often. Is a 
deslable ideal in the least 
and more so, an obtain- 
able goal. 

In the November 1972 Is- 
sue of Commentary mag- 
azine, Irving Krlstol in his 
article "About Equality," 
concerning 1) the deslabll- 
ity of equality 2) the re- 
cent emergence of this ob- 
session and 3) the likely 
hood of it succeeding. Mr. 
Krlstol's remarks are 
most Interesting In that 
he lays the blame of the 
recent controversy clearly 
at the feet of the Ameri- 
can intelligensla. The 
thrust of his article moves 
from the basis that the 
people, the non-intellect- 
ual, the worker, the aver- 
age American, is more 
firmly planted In a real 
perception of his condition 
than Is his would be re- 
former. Equality then Is a 
condition, a relationship 
between knowing what has 
been accomplished and 
what one views can be or 
should be accomplished. In 
real as well as In Ideal- 
istic terms. 

America's intellect- 
ual class", and I use that 



Stan Jones 



term more in what they call 
themselves and not so 
much in what they accom- 
plish, is today obsessed, or 
as It may be, possessed 
by the all pervalUng Utopian 
concept of equality, hlndg- 
Ing first and foremost on 
the concept of legitimacy 
In society. The "intellect- 
ual class' views with con- 
tempt the positive claim 
that most people make on 
the legitimacy of Ameri- 
can society. American 
society is not fit to sur- 
vive as it is, they shout. 
Just look at all the 
Iniquities which exist. 

As Mr. Krlstol states, 
and I humbly concur, "a 
just and legitimate society, 
according to Aristotle, is 
one In which Inequallties- 
of preperty, or station, or 
power- are generally per- 
cleved by the cltizenery 
as necessary for the com- 
mon good. I do not see 
that this definition has been 
Improved on...'',indeed Mr. 
Krlstol goes on to explain 
that as a general rule the 
public has accepted this 
given situation and grad- 
ually but steadily Improved 
on it while an obviously 
lletlst "class" has contin- 
ually looked on in disgust. 
Believing It would seem a 
"we know what's good for 
you better than you know 
yourself. This contempt- 
able attitude has 0ven us 
more social and personal 
turmoil since the Civil War, 
a condition more artificlal- 
(To Column 4) 



iy Induced, I might add, 
then naturally aroused. 

the desire to obtain 
equality has led us to im- 
plement such programs as 
The Great Societies 'War 
on Poverty'; the brainchild 
of the liberal establish- 
ment. The Office of 
Economic Opportunity and 
probably one of the most 
controversial and emotion 
ridden endeavors, the 
forced Integration of the 
public school system. 

To take this last example 
in point, we find that con- 
trary to the stated goals 
of the program, the level 
of scholastic achelvement 
has not negligibly risen 
and in numerous cases 
it has shown no improve- 
ment what ever. 

The "Coleman Report' of 
1966 (mandated by the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964) show- 
ed, much to the dismay 
of its advocates, that the 
scholastic achievement of 
the student Is almost 
wholly independant of 
the quality of the school. 
What the report was say- 
ing was that forced equal- 
ity of enviroment had 
little or no effect on an 
Improvement In the stu- 
dents performance and the 
genetic charactrlstics 

predominatly determined ' 
dent. In his book. Inequal- 
ity; A Reassessment of the 



effect of Family and 
Schooling in America, 
author Christopher Jencks 
comes to essentiallv the 
same conclusion. 
It would seem then from 
these studies that the in- 
roads made into American 
society by the Utopian re- 
formers has failed to live 
up to its claims. Indeed 
they have failed miserably. 
Not only do they claim to 
transform our society into 
an "equal, legitimate 
society' (defined as such, 
it would seem by them and 
them alone) but to a better, 
yes better, society than we 
have now. Fortunatly, the 
people know more than 
their reformers. One would 
gather from a view of the 
people In our society that 
they have accepted 
Aristotle's claim of leg- 
itimacy, recognized it for 
what it Is, and then pro- 
ceeded to Improve them- 
selves and their neighbors. 
The proposals to radical- 
ly transform our society 
have not met with success 
and probibly never will due 
to this prevailing belief. 
It might, I feel, do these 
'intellectuals' some good 
if they came down from 
their pious plateaus and be- 
came acquainted with the 
whys and hows of our 
society; they seem to know 
so little of It. 



A DIFFERENT 
PERSPECTIVE 



(A weekly report) 
This week's author is 
Charles Pratt 
Student Senator 

As a result of a report 
made by the Faculty-Stu- 
dent Committee on Parking 
Facilities, paid parking 
was initiated in the fall 
semester of 1970. Over the 
past 3 years the Parking 
Facilities Account has ac- 
cumulated over $300,000 in 
funds. Through a Student 
Senate investigation, fig- 
ures were made available 
by Dean Manges on the 
Parking Facilities Ac- 
count. According to the ad- 
ministration each asphalt 
car space costs $350 with 
an expected life span of 15 
years. Since the State Leg- 
islature has refused to al- 
locate money for parking it 
appears that paid parking is 
the only feasable alterna- 
tive for our campus. 

However, the question 
still remains as to what the 
Parking Facilities Account 
does with the money it has 
collected. Again, according 
to Dean Manges, the Idea 
of a parking garage is be- 
ing Investigated. With the 
$300,000 the University is 
trying to get a "favorable 
bond issue," But it is In- 
teresting to note that (1) 
the monies collected at this 
point are not sufficient (2) 
the State Legislature must 
approve the garage and (3) 
The Purdue Business man- 



ager's office has ques- 
tioned the feasabillty of 
such an investment. Mean- 
while we must continue us- 
ing the available lots at the 
same costs. 

The Student Senate has re- 
quested that the adminis- 
tration look into the parking 
facilities for the handicap- 
ped. The Parking and 
Traffic Advisory Commit- 
tee has promised to pro- 
duce recommendations 
concerning this problem. 
The problem facing these 
people is that to use hand- 
icap facilities one is forc- 
ed to buy the "A" parking 
sticker. They have no other 
choice. Dean Manges has 
commented that he can see 
both sides of the issue. He 
stated that while it does 
limit one financially it also 
must be recognized that 
the parking spaces are in 
"A" lots and therefore 
must be charged with the 
cost of an "A" sticker. In 
this writer's opinion it 
seems unfair to punish the 
handicapped because the 
university is sllghtlyin- 
convlenanced. The Student 
Senate will, however, see 
that the Parking and Traf- 
fic Advisory Committee in- 
vestigates this problem. 

It has taken slightly over 
3 weeks to complete this 
investigation. However, if 
there are any requests for 
further Information the 
Student's Government will 
accept the responsibility to 
produce it.
