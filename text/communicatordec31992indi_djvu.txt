answer formal, and is sponsored by IPSGA. 

In related news, an organizalional and infer-

swer questions con- 
cerning the new Edu- 
Care guidelines for 
IPFW users. 
Lori Martin, member of Kids Without Care, 
said, "Wc arc encouraging any parent lo go lo 
the forum meeiing. We had a poor showing 
last week. Parents need lo lell ihe uruversity 
what they'd like for child care, and Ihey have 
10 let them know there is an interest in child 
care." 

FLASHER HITS CAMPUS; 
POLICE HAVE SUSPECT 

A pair of indecent exposure incidents on 
campus, occurring minuies apart, have Ihc 
IPFW police force on ihe lookout for the 
perpetrator. 

The incidents, in parking lots two and five 
occurred around II a.m. on Nov. 19, and 
didn't surprise Lauren DenHartog. IPFW's 
chief of police. 
"We have a few in- 
cidents like this 
every year. I'm not 
surprised thai it hap- 
pened again," said 
DenHanog. 
"We haven't made an 
arrest yet." said Den- 
Hanog. "We have a 
suspect and are inves- 
tigating ii. We're 
working with the prosecutor's office on this 
case." 

"This kind of ihing usually happens in 
streaks," said the chief. "You get a lot of them 
in a short period and ihen they stop." 

Indecent exposure, under Indiana law, is a 
Qass 'A' misdemeanor punishable by up to a 
year in prison and S5000 in fines per offense. 

THEIVES SNATCH CASH, 
CREDIT CARDS FROM

A wallet and acdii cards were taken from an 
unlocked locker Nov. 19 around II a.m., and 
S2] in cash was siolen from a locked locker 
around 3 p.m. on Nov. 30. 

According to IPFW police chief Lauren Den- 
Hartog, the holiday season can be correlated 
with a marked rise in ihe theft of cash and cred- 
it cards. 
"Christmas is a big 
lime for theft. More 
people are more des- 
perate for money," 
said DenHanog. 
"There is a lot of pres- 
sure for money associ- 
ated with Ihe holiday 
season. People need to 
be extra careful."

Students beat system with grade appeal ruling 



By J. WUIlara Richardson 
Managing Editor 

Afier three years of setbacks 
and litigation, 13 IPFW students 
have iriumphed, beating the sys- 
tem in a court of law. 

IPFW graduate Sally Mahnken 
and twelve other students who 
took business Z-302 in the sum- 
mer of 1989 filed suit in Allen 
County circuit court against the 
trustees of Indiana University 
seeking a ruling on their grade 
appeal for the class. 

Eighteen of 27 students in the 
class, taught by Ahmad Karim. 
appealed their final grades, citing 
"improper condition" in the 
leaching and testing of the class. 

"Wc started talking about an 
appeal before the class was 
over." said Mahnken, "It's a re- 
quired class for graduation. I 
ended up getting an A in it when 
I look it again." 

Mahnkcn and the other appeal- 
ers took ihcir case to coun after 



having their normal university 
appeals thrown out. 

"No one would even listen to 
us," said Mahnken. "We had no 
recourse. They wouldn't even 
consider it." 

Circuit Court Judge Thomas 
Ryan ruled in 
favor of Ihe stu- 
dents on Sept. 2 
and decreed 
that a ruling be 
convened lo as- 
sess the dam- 
ages to the sru- 
dcnis involved. 

David Mc- 
Cants, vice- 
chancellor of 
academic affairs, sees the ruling 
not as an indictment of the grade 
appeal process as a whole but of 
the procedures used in one spe- 
cific case. 

"There has been no thought 
about changing our appeals 
process," said McCants. "Ac- 



cording to the ir\isiees attorney, 
we erred in not hearing the ap- 
peal, but the appeal process is 
not flawed. Given that interpreta- 
tion, the process docs not need to 
be rewritten." 
According to the students' at- 



'■(The students) arc entitled to redress in this court from the 
university... for denying them a fair hearing to determine 
their contractual rights,.. 

...ihc committee pcncxtually refused to hear the students' 
appeal and thus denied the students their due process in the 
face of sufficient allegations." 

-Judge Thomas Ryan's ruling 

on Sally M. Mahnkcn, etal. 

vs. BoardofTnjsiees 



tomey, John Feighner of Mailer 
&amp; Colvin, a local law firm, the 
case may still be months from 
being over. The date for the dam- 
ages hearing has yet to be set. 

"Considering the judge's calen- 
dar, 1 expect it will be in a month 
or two," said Feigner. "We're 



pleased that the judge has ruled 
in our favor at this stage in the 
case. We certainly expect to con- 
tinue pursuing this litigation on 
the behalf of our clients." 

The trustees' legal reprcsenia- 
tivc. Albert Velasquez of lU's le- 
gal depanmcni 
in Blooming- 
ton, was un- 
available for 
comment on the 
case. 

According to 
Mahnken, the 
13 students who 
sued have all 
since graduated. 
Mahnkcn said 
the students will probably seek 
minor Financial repayment and 
legal fees payment at ihe damage 
assessment hearing. 

"My main concern is that poli- 
cies be set up to avoid repealing 
this kind of situation." said 
Mahnken. "We're thrilled about 



the judge's decision. It is prece- 
dent setting," 

Karim, an associate professor 
in the business department, is 
sure the ruling docs not reflect 
on his teaching. 

Those were the first and last 
grades I've ever had appealed," 
said Karim. "I ihink 1 do a good 
job in ihc classroom." 

McCants said the university 
will probably take a look at the 
procedures lo decide whether an 
appeal will be heard by the Aca- 
demic Appeals Subcommittee. 

"There is a need for some clari- 
ficadon." said McCants. 

Three years later, the students 
may not be satisfied widi clarifi- 
cation, however. 

"Did they learn a lesson? I 
don't know. Maybe they'll have 
to change," said Mahnkcn, "The 
question is who is the university 
here to serve?"

Campus survey shows prevalence of racism 

Ethnic jokes bother students most 



By Sarah Jakacky 
Chief Reporter 

Racist actions and attitudes ex- 
ist on campus, according lo a 
survey conducted by William 
Ludwin, public and environ- 
mental affairs director, 

Ludwin organized and con- 
ducted a survey charting the 
campus climate for minority stu- 
denis at IPFW. The survey. 
which was requested by the 
Council on Minority Recruit- 
ment and Reten- 
tion, was to deter- 
mine Ihe degree of 
racism at IPFW. 

According to 
Ludwin. the coun- 
cil "wanted to put 
some kind of di- 
mension to the 
problem. Wc were 
looking for base- 
line data and we Frank 
warned to gain 
some kind of understanding as 
to how students feel." 

In the survey, which only 36 
percent of all IPFW minority 
students answered, the largest 
area of concern was jokes. 
Nearly 28 percent of die respon- 
dents said they felt insulted by 
jokes that singled out a certain 
ethnic group. 

Other top-ranking prejudiced 
actions involved being singled 
out and t&gt;eing insulted. 




Among all racist attitudes to- 
ward students, the most com- 
mon place incidents occurred in 
the classroom. Other places on 
campus where a high number of 
discriminating events happened 
were Kctller Hall and the 
Hclmke Library. 

The survey also noted that 
more prejudiced acts were com- 
mitted by faculty than by stu- 
dents. 
Although he was not shocked 
by the information, 
Ludwin explained. 
"It is clear African 
American students 
feel dieir is a lot of 
prejudice. They 
feel it and believe 
iu" 

Minority stu- 
dents expressed 
anger and said 
BorelU they were singled 

oui because of 
dieirrace. Some listed being ig- 
nored in class, being inaccurate- 
ly accused of wrongdoings, and 
even feeling animosity toward 
jokes. 

Jokes ranked as the most com- 
mon and most unacceptable 
form of discrimination. Overall 
embarrassment and negative 
feelings were also noted. 

Ludwin said his role was to or- 
ganize and distribute a survey 
concerning the climate on cam- 



pus for minority students. The 
survey was the first of its kind 
conducted at IPFW. and Ludwin 
said it was very scientific. 

Vice Chancellor Frank Borelli 
is also working with the Council 
on Minority Recruitment and 
Retention. 

"We have a lot of work to do. 
Right now we are working 
through Ihe survey results. 
There is a lot of material lo cov- 
er," said Borelli. 

Borelli added the council's 
first task will be to disseminate 
the results. Then Ihe council 
wdl address the issues. He said 
ihe final goal of the committee 
is to increase the retention of 
minority students on campus, 
specifically African Americans. 

The primary group the council 
will target will be African 
Americans because they have 
the lowest graduation rate at 
IPFW, according to Borelli. 

"We want minorities to feel 
more comfortable and more ac- 
cepted. But first we have to 
know what kind of climate we 
arc dealing with." Borelli ex- 
plained. 

IPSGA also expressed concern 
over the survey results. 

Mark King, chairman of inter- 
nal affairs, said, 'The figures are 
very astounding to us." 

Previously, King said he was 
not aware of the extent of racial 



bias on campus, and he added vent their own poll that will be 
ihe survey helped to put the 
problem into perspective. 

However. King did criticize 
the survey. He said he found the 
questions very leading. Also, 
the qucsdons were not represen- 
tative of the student body since 
almost 70 percent of the respon- 
denis were female African 
Americans. 

Other problems King n

Gay integration necessary 



There are cases when peo- 
ple have been sent lo war 
zones without ammunition, 
fined thousands of doUars and 
even some who were forced 
10 undergo an anal cavity 
search. 

Why? Because ihey were 
suspected to have performed 
homosexual acts on their own 
time, and in many cases, off 
of the military base. 

But Clinton's crusade to 
Slop the ban on gays in the 
military has people up in 
aims. 

Military brass feverently 
oppose Clinton's liberal 
approach and fear letting 
homosexuals into America's 
armed forces would prove 
deadly to heterosexual sol- 
diers. 

Military personnel opposed 
to allowing gay persons in the 
armed forces alongside het- 
erosexuals list several reasons 
why they feel it would be dis- 
asterous to lift the gay ban. 
Maintenance of morale 
Certain individuals in the 
military feel that allowing gay 
people to be open about their 
sexuality would promote low 
morale among the non-gay 
members. 

Do people think there aren't 
homosexuals in the military 
already? It's the attitude that 
if we pretend they're not fhere 
then they don't exist, but 
there are gays in the military. 
So what difference does it 
make to anyone's morale if 
homosexuality is being hid- 
den or if ii becomes an open 
issue? 

Adminislralive efficiency 
Along with a fear of low 
morale, military people think 
enlisted men won't have any 
respect for commanding offi- 
cers who are homosexual. 
People think no one will 
respect a person who is a non- 
heterosexual. 

The army, navy, marines 
and airforce do not train their 
officers to be figures of scorn 
and ridicule. People do not 
risk lives and invest years 
working their way through 
the ranks only to be ignored 
once they achieve officer sta- 
tus because they are gay. 
AIDS 

Fear of health risks is yet 
another argument for those in 
favor of banning gays from 
the military. 

AIDS surely ranks high on 
the worry list for those con- 
cerned with infections among 
military persons. But there 
are also such diseases as 
hepatitis A, hepatitis B, 
syphilis and gonorrhea. 

These highly infectious dis- 
eases should not be discount- 
ed, but arc heterosexuals 
excluded from contracting 
diseases? 



If the military, however, 
has not instituted precautions 
for preventing diseases 
already then that is a sad 
statement for our government. 
Thousands of dollars are 
being spent for research on 
how fast a plastic bullet can 
be shot through layers of 
steel, and not on health pre- 
vention in the military? 
Promiscuity 

There is fear among sup- 
porters of the ban that by 
allowing homosexuals to live 
with members of the same sex 
the temptation for sexual 
promiscuity is greatly height- 
ened. 

Among heterosexuals is it 
an issue if women can per- 
form as well as men ? At one 
time it was an issue, so too 
were blacks and Hispanics 
in the military. The niilitaiy 
said it would never be pos- 
sible to integrate these 
groups. Hmmm. 

Considerations for hetero- 
sexuals who engage in sex 
should be weighed with equal 
thought as homosexuals who 
do. Yet, when it is suspected 
two heterosexuals have had 
sex, they are not interrogated 
and humiliated as has been 
frequently done to homosexu- 
als. 

What people do not under- 
stand, they fear; And what 
people fear is what becomes 
discrimination. 

Why should a man or 
woman's sexual preference be 
an issue of concern if it does 
not interfere with perfor- 
mance. 
Discrimination 
There are numerous cases 
of people being harassed, 
interrogated, fired, demoted 
and humiliated for suspicion 
of homosexual conduct. 
These are not people from 
text books in the past. These 
discriminations are taking 
place as recent as the Persian- 
Gulf wars, possibly even now. 
It is not a matter merely of 
health concerns, or morale or 
even ability but it is an issue 
of humanity. 

People think if someone 
does not practice a socieially 
prescribed lifestyle, then they 
are wrong and should be pun- 
ished. It is closed minds that 
people should be worried 
about, not whether or not two 
men should be able to have 
sex or two women can sleep 
together. 

If citizens allow the military 
to continue to discriminate, 
humiliate and denigrate 
minority groups then it is as 
much the citizens' responsi- 
bility as the government's to 
elect officials who will recog- 
nize human rights. 

It is not a sex issue, it is an 
issue of persona] freedom.

To the Editor: 

ATTENTION JIM WALKER (or 

should we say "Rtiss RcklawO- 

Your disgusting piece liilcd, 
"Date mc if you dare." is the last of 
the liiiJe boy. high school journalism 
wc ever want to hear again! You are 
a rapisi of language and you will be 
stopped! 

Your "funny" LllIc column wasted 
no time in inviting immature meat- 
heads to go out and rape women. 
Every one of your "tips" was a 
threat! Holding a straight razor up to 
a woman's throat is auemptcd mur- 
der and kidnapping. 

You are telling me thai it is okiay 
to become murderously jealous over 
another man touching your date and 
that men alone decide what a 
woman can do. Your "recommended 
time table" is a clear description of 
rape - - play by play. If this is your 
ideal fanasy of how a women should 
be iR'ated, you arc sick and cruel. 

A!«), how dare you mention the 
ancient stereotype that women smell 
like fish! This is like listening in on 
a group of malicious grade school 
boys. Jim Walker-women do not 
smell like fish anymore than you do! 

If you're going to write and pub- 
lish such evil in The Communicator, 
why don't you have the GUTS to 
use your real name and an undis- 
guised photo. Come on Jim. if it's so 
funny, stand proud behind your 
wonderful journalistic abilities.

Why the fuss? 
Raw Russ 




Editor's note: The following is excerpt- 
ed from Russ Reklaw's column, "Raw 
Lust," that appeared in The Communi- 
cator on page four of the Nov. 19 issue. 

"Dating: This has nothing to do with 
love. Don't even try to tell me it docs! 
And I know, because I date chicks. I'm 
noble, so 1 thought I'd share some spccihc 
success-tips for single men." 

"If the direct approach fails you, try holding a stright razor up to 
her neck. If you are in a dark place, a switch blade comb will work 
fine. What you say here is also important. I prefer, "Move quietly 
out [he door. Make a sound and you get cut."" 

"For an exua special evening I'll take my date through the Hot 
and Now drive-through, park my Dodge in a closcd-up garage, then 
dine on burgers while breathing in unhealthy amounts of carbon 
monoitidc. Later in the evening, I like to lake a date out dancing. 
"Dance." I'll say. "But if some guy touches you, both of you are 
dead." Then I open my leather jacket and flash my pistol. This 
makes for hours of fun,"

Week

Jim Walker, resign and have a real 
journalism student take over and 
straighten out this idiotic high 
school rag!

Reklaw is brutal, insensitive 



To the Editor: 

The Communicator Policy, as 
stated on page two of the newspa- 
per, is, "Opinion expressed in The 
Communicator is thai of the 
writer..and is not to be construed 
as representing thai of the univer- 
sity administration, the faculty, or 
the students." 

We have been informed that 
Russ Reklaw is a pseudonym for 
Jim Walker — the editor in chief of 
The Communicalor. If this is so, 
then the column written by Russ 
Reklaw, "Raw Lust." is actually 
writien by the person who most 
represents our campus newspaper 

In the Nov. 19 issue of The 
Communicator, "Russ Reklaw" 
displayed total contempt and 
insensitivity to the women of this 
university by trivializing die trau- 
ma of rape and attempting to make 



a joke about a brutal crime. 
Reklaw demeans and terrorizes 
women when he says that men can 
get a date by "...holding a straight 
razor up to her neck" or using a 
"switch blade comb" for persua- 
sion. 

Can you imagine the anguish a 
rape victim might have felt read- 
ing this article? Do you suppose 
she laughed when she read. "Then 
1 open my jacket and (lash my pis- 
tol. This makes for houis of fun." 

Irresponsible, insensitive articles 
of tJiis nature do not belong in our 
campus newspaper. Jim Walker, 
alias Russ Reklaw, needs to be 
replaced with an ediior in chief 
who is capable of being discerning 
and compassionate.

P.S. Do you have the spine to pub- 
lish this letter? We'll see. 

Ed. DOte: I am not Russ Reklaw 
nor have I ever been Russ Reklaw. 
I know Russ Reklaw, and I am no 
Russ Reklaw. 

I apologize for any misunder- 
standing. The R«klaw character is 
intended as a parody and not lo 
promote hatred towards women, 
or rape. 

Russ must go 

To the Editor: 

1 was appalled by the aiticle "Raw 
Lust" by "Russ Reklaw" (Nov. 19). 
The piece obviously served no infor- 
mational purpose so it must have 
been intended as a humorous col- 
umn. The "humorist" who must 
reson to the dcgradauon and humili- 
ation of other people to get a laugh is 
not amusing, but pathetic. 

I can't imagine that you would 
print a column that jokes about 
lynching African-Americans or 
burning Jewish people in ovens. 
Those topics arc righdy not accept- 
able as subjects for humor. Why do 
you regard violence against women 
as an appropriate source of entertain- 
ment? The misogyny in that article 
was some of the most abhorrent I've 
seen ever in a new,spaper 

Exercising your First Amendment 
rights doesn't mean publishing every 
piece of garbage that meets a dead- 
line.

To the Editor: 

What wiih lodiy's poliiical climaie, 
vis a vis how our lan dollare arc being 
spent, il surprises mc ihsi ihere is so 
liiiic concern for how our dollars are 
t&gt;cing managed closer lo home 

Il has been repeatedly rcponed in this 
newspaper ihal your siudcnis' govern- 
ment controls fifty percent of your stu- 
dent service fees, or approximately 
5250,000, Thai represents a quaner of 
ft million dollars student monies tor 
which we receive only a most cursory 
accouniing. 

What in the hell arc wc gelling for 
our money? Wc arc lold that "smdcni 
groups" arc funded. Thai's nice but 
who are these "groups" and what arc 
they being funded for and in what 
amounts? Wc have been told that the 
childcarc faciliiy received some 
530,000 of student funding. Fine, but 
as there is no longer a child care facili- 
ty do wc get a refund? 

We are not being lold how much of 
this quarter of a million dollars is dedi- 
cated lo salaries for our service-mind- 
ed studeni representatives, or how 
much is being spent on travel and 
enicrtainmeni. 
I think mosi 
students 
would be sur- 
prised (if not 
outraged) to 
discover thai 
the ajnount of 
their dollars 
spent on sup- 
porting the suite of offices for stu- 
dents' government is ten times what 
most students pay for rcni. 

In fact, docs anyone even taiow who 
in the hell ihcse people arc who we arc 
supporting with our student service 
fees? I doubt it. In fact, our siudcnis" 
government does noi seem lo know 
who its members arc. 

In a recent advcrlisemcnl purchased 
in this newspaper (again, with our 
monies) by the students' government, 
Kelsey Kcycs was listed as the Chief 
Justice of ihe Student Couri- a fact 
thai I confirmed with the vice presi- 
dent of finance of our govcmmcnL 

Kelsey was a close friend of mine and 
was amused lo Icam thai she siill occu- 
pied her position, especially after she 
graduated seven months ago and is liv- 
ing in Michigan! When one of ihe high- 
-esi, if not the highesi, officials in stu- 
""dents' government is no longer a studeni ' 
and is living in another stale, il causes 
one 10 question the validity and credibil- 
ity- if not the inielligence- of the stu- 
dents who are spending our monies. 

Your sividcnt government will no 
doubt reply to this leiicr. as they 
always do, by allocking my former 
adminisiraiion and suggesting that 
more students need to become 
involved. Nctihcr reply offers a sound 
response. 

Throughout my administration this 
newspaper covered sludents" govern- 
ment constantly, as they should. If you 
look through the newspapers for the 
years that I was in students' govern- 
ment you will rarely, if bi all, find a 
front page nol dedicated to students' 
government. This was during a time 
when all of our meetings were adver- 
tised and posted and well attended by 
students. 

This was during an administration 
when my personal life was being por- 
trayed through the weekly headlines of 
this paper. This was during an admin- 
isuaiion in which there were visible 
firoofs of your money being spent on 
you inrougn ilic purctiase ol letevi: 
sions and microwaves in lounges and 
picnic tables throughout campus. This 
was at a lime when your govcnunent 
was providing you with student direc- 
tories, discount directories, yearbooks, 
typewriters and typing rooms in the 
library and on and on and an. 

Now wc have a students' govern- 
ment comprised of members we do nol 
know, meetings held in secret, no 
accouniing of its expenditures and 
memben (Uiai wc have heard oO that 
no longer exist on this campus. All of 
this and no newspaper reporting. How 
interesting. 

A former editor in chief of this news- 
paper was accused of being biased 
towards my administration (yes, the 
one thai approved ihc personal attacks 
on my characierj because he was a 
friend of the studeni body presideoL 

If. judging by the lack of invcsuga- 
tive rqjoning of siudenis' government 
bpy this newspaper, we are lo draw con- 
clusions about the current editor in 
chief wc mighl assume he is on the 
smdenis' government payroll. 

Wake up. students! If you do not 
have the time to become pcrionalJy 
involved in this issue, at Icasi demand 
thai your newspaper serve as the 
watchdog that its constitutional pro- 
scription demands. I. for one. do not 
intend to sit l&gt;ack and allow my stu- 
deni service fees to be mishandled- 

If someone docs no( do something I 
will be forced lo join students' govern- 
ment again. How js thai for a scary 
diougbt? That, in iisclf, should provide 
some on this campus wiih adequate 
motivation lo get involved.

Conspiracy? 

Rekiaw gunned down by crazed reader 



Thursday, December 3. 1992 



By Jim Walker 
Editor in ChieF 

The atiempicd murdci of Leisure 
columnisl Russ Rcklaw has local 
police barned, although one suspcci 
LI already in custody. 

The conlrovcrsial psychic Rekiaw 
has drawn hcai laieiy from women's 
activists for writing columns that 
"promote date rape and murder." 

Rekiaw, 32, was shot five limes 
early Monday morning outside of 
his sleeping room at the Highway 
View Motor Lodge in Fori Wayne. 

"I'd give my right eye to 
see you shot full of holes 
and floating face down in a 
farm pond," suspected 
shootist Patsy Gullet to 
Rekiaw. 

Rekiaw was struck by two bullets 
in the chest, one in the right leg, one 
in the lower back and one close to 
his groin. The bullet near Reklaw's 
groin glanced off his targe western- 
style belt buckle, but the other bul- 
lets ripped his flesh. 

In 3 press conference held earlier 
today, Reklaw's personal surgeon 
Dr. Charles Stenkenlikgcn said his 
patient was in critical condition but 
all bullets had been removed. 

Stenkenlikgcn took a quick drink 
from his pocket flask and told 
rcpoders, "Mr. Rcklaw is currently 
comatose but we are hopeful for a 
full recovery. He is a very strong 

Hospital officials said Rekiaw 
woke for the first time late this 
afternoon and requested a canon of 
Marlboro Reds and a liter of MiUer 
beer. 

Stenkenlikgcn said Reklaw's 
awakening was a good sign, but he 
noted new problems have arisen 
with his patient Rcklaw is also suf- 
fering from intense alcohol and 
nicotine withdrawal symptoms, the 
doctor said. He added that Reklaw's 
requests for smokes and booze have 
been denied because "that sort of 
activity Is not permitted on the 
intensive care unit" 

As Rcklaw struggles to recover 
from bullet wounds and the D.T.'s, 
suspect Patsy Gullet is coniTmcd in 
the Allen County lock-up. 

Gullet has been preliminary 
charged with attempted murder and 
leaving the scene of an attempted 
murder. 

Earlier today as she was led to her 
cell. Gullet was heard screaming "I 
didn't kill anybody. I'm a patsy." It 
is unclear if Gullet meant that she 
was set up or that no person named 
"Patsy" would ever shoot a guy. 

Police reports show evidence 
linking Gullet to the scene of the 
Clime. Her finger prints were found 
on the .22 caliber pistol recovered 
by police near Reklaw's body. And 



Gullet's drivers license was also 
found by police in a grassy area 
three feet from the spot where 
Rekiaw was gunned down. 

Gullet's lawyer, Wcase Snow, 
doesn't believe his client shot 
Rekiaw. "She was framed. There is 
much more to this crime than meets 
the naked eye. We think it was a 
drug-related shooting. Or maybe it 
was a Mafia hit." 

Rekiaw is notorious for his ties to 
organized crime, gambling and 
book-making. He is rumored to use 
his psychic powers to win bets at 
dog tracks and other sporting 
events. 

"Maybe he lost his psychic power 
and racked up a debt he couldn't 
afford to repay." Snow suggested. 

Police say other Rekiaw conspira- 
cy theories have surfaced today. 
Some experts suspect CIA or KGB 
involvement. Others link die shoot- 
ing with the suspicious death of Bob 
Marie y. 

Rekiaw may be his own best wit- 
ness when he recovers enough to 
speak coherently. At press time, 
Rekiaw could only mumble "Any- 
body got a light?" and "Nurse. I 
need anodicr sponge bath," 

When police asked him questions 
about the crime, Rcklaw could only 
say, "Rosebud. . . Rosebud." 

Police say they think Gullet did 
not work alone in the shooting. But 
police have more Uian just the evi- 
dence found at the crime scene to 
link her to the attempted murder. 
Gullet sent two threatening letters to 
Rekiaw last week and left several 
messages on the newspaper's 
answering machine. 

In one message. Gullet said, "I 
want to see you impaled on a big 
stick. Die, you evil, satanic, com- 



munist bastard, I'd give my nght 
eye to see you shot full of holes and 
floating face down in a farm pond." 

A Communicator spokesperson 
said, "We didn't call the police 
because we really saw nothing 
unusual about the message. Russ 
gets diose messages all of the time. 
Usually, it is an ex-girlfriend or per- 
son he robbed." 

According to the spokesperson, 



Reklaw's column will return next 
week. "He will do the next one from 
his hospital bed if he has to. We 
need that column to fill space and to 
help meet our deadline." 

"We are all saddened and sick- 
ened by what happened to our dear 
friend Russ," the spokesperson 
added choking back sally tears. "He 
is really a fine man. Russ has always 
been grcady misunderstood."

Computers smart gift for students 



By Mary Shrock 
Features Editor 

Compuiers have become pan of 
evoyone's life. Whether or not you 
realize it compuiers make jobs pos- 
sible, our ability to get 
fast cash out of those 
automated tellers and 
computers are respon- 
sible for keeping track 
of check books, bank 
balances and our lives. 

Having a personal 
home computer, or PC, 
can be helpful not only in organiz.- 
ing accounts or balancing the house- 
hold budget but for educating chil- 
dren. There are software packages 
available now programmed to help 
children learn their ABC's 
and mulliplicaiion tables. 

But the first step is buying 
an affordable and adaptable 
personal unit. 

Frontier Computers offers 
buyers a chance to customize 
their own compuiers. 

Jeff Christner, a purchaser 
for Frontier Computers and a 
sophomore a( IPFW said,

board, a mouse (a curious attach- 
ment which allows users to open 
windows on files, editing or format- 
ting) and a printer. Those are the 
basics; then you need to buy soft- 
ware packages. Everything's extra," 
McGroarty said. 

Prices for most basic name brand 
computers at MicroAge and Com- 
puicrland ranged from $1200 lo 
S5000. And for IBM or Compaq 
clones at MicroAge. PC's are priced 
from S800 to $2000. according to 
sales associates. 

One important detail to remember

"One of the biggest things to look 
at when you buy a computer is thai 
it's easy lo upgrade. A lot of name 
brand computers like IBM, Tandy 
and Packard can't be upgraded," 
Chrisuiersaid, 

So what options do buyers have? 
According lo Chrisincr consumers 
can buy clones. 

"IBM clones have basically the 
same function of an IBM. Ninety 
percent of our parts are like IBM, 
but we build them ourselves so if it 
needs something we can change any 
part of the computer." Christner 
said.

Schwartz suggested Christmas 
gift ideas for people who already 
own compuiers. 

"You could buy people small 
desktops for personal compuiers. or 
blank diskettes for a couple dollars a 
piece." Schwartz said, 

IPFW's computing and data pro- 
cessing depanmcni hopes lo txgin a 
course next semester for students 
thinking of buying a personal com- 
puter. 

Bobbi Barnes, help desk operator 
said she teaches the course as a 
guideline for people considering 

buying a home computer. 

According lo Barnes it's 
important for people to know 
what use their computer will 
serve, whether it's for business, 
personal or educational purpos- 
es. 

Different types of software 
are essential to different com- 
puter systems, as well, accord- 
ing to Barnes. Buyers can 
chose between word processing, 
spread sheets, data base, utilities 
or graphics, 

Barnes also pointed out through 
IPFW ii was possible for students to 
receive forty percent off IBM and 
Gateway computers.

Aftermath of abortion subject of new play 



By Mary Shrock 
Features Editor 

Abortion transcends theory; it's 
part of life. Whether you know 
someone who has 
had an abortion or 
have yourself under- 
gone one, abortion is 
no longer a taboo 
subject. 

Talk shows, news 
stories and made-for- 
iv movies have dealt with the sen- 
sitive issue. 

IPFW is one establishment to 
portray its own perspectives on 
abortion, Purdue-Indiana Theater 
plans to produce a piece about 
abortion called Sanguinarians, 

According to Neil Labule, the au- 
thor and director of this production 
the unusual name is of his own 
making. 

"1 created the title. It means 
those who revel in bloodletting. 
It's meant to be provocative," 
Labute said. 

Labule has been an assistant pro- 
fessor of theater at IPFW since Au- 
gust. This is the second original 
play he has pn^duccd at IPFW. 



'Sanguinarians' 
play by Neil Labute 

Dec 10-12 

9 p jn. in Ketller G4« 

Cost: $1 for students 

$2 for public 



Sanguinarians is a half-hour play 
of back 10 back monologues with 
narratives bookending the begin- 
ning and end. according to Labuic. 
While the play 
docs deal with abor- 
tion, ii is not a play 
about abortion, but a 
play of consequence 
on mdividuals lives. 

"One of the 
biggest things 1 write 
about is what people are capable of 
doing and still be able to sleep al 
night." Labuic said. 

Labute said it is not 
about a moral choice 
as much as a choice of 
denial for the charac- 
ters, 

"It's not the fact thai 
they did it (abortion), 
but that they are deny- 
ing it." Labule went on 
to say. "It's not cos- 
metic. People try to 
make it (abortion) oui 
to be something even 
less than having your 
appendix out," Labule said. 
Tuesday, Dec.8 through Thurs- 



day. Dec. 10 audiences can come to 
Keiilcr Hall G46, at 9 p.m. and sec 
how Labule pulls off doing an 
abortion piece that is neither pro- 
or anii-aboruon. 

"It's cool in its emotion. The text 
docsn'l scream at you. It's not 
what I did but how I live with it," 
Labuic said. 

"I've run into so many people 
who have had abortions. TTiey try 
to deny the emotion with it. U 
takes a heavy emotional toll on 
you." Labuic said. 
Twelve actors and Labule himself 
will perform mdivid- 
ual monologues about 
their characters' expe- 
rience with abortion, 

IPFW students 
performing are Jeremy 
Cassidy. Fred Dowse. 
Kira Downey and 
Shannon Fry, 

Other students 
siaiTing in ihe produc- 
tion are Amber Hous-

Old Oaken Bucket 
travels back to Purdue 



B J Joe Heersche 
Sports Editor 

Sixiy eight years ago on a sunny 
aubirnn aficmoon in November, be- 
fore a handful of well-groomed 
sweater vcsied college- types, Indi- 
ana and Purdue University's football 
teams battled in a well-worn field 
with only a few dumps of grass 
scatteicd about. 

These husky men ran the pigskin 
with aplomb, sacrificed their limbs 
with cut-blocks, and, with aban- 
doned recklessness, executed crush- 
ing tackles on their opponents. 

IPFW Sports 
Spotlight 

With no more than a leather cap 
sans faccmasks, thigh pads not wor- 
thy of serving as elbow pads today 
and a long sleeve sweater lo cover 
their upper lorso, these men banged, 
crashed, and boomed their way 
through the battle. 

Their incentive: certainly not a 
huge pro contract, or a shot at a 
bowl game in Miami over the holi- 
days, not c ven a brief appearance af- 
ter the game on television. 

TTie players of 1924 played for ihe 
honor of their school and the respect 
of being Indiana's best football 
team. 

After the game ended, amidst the 
jubilant players, and the cheering 
crowd, a symbol was found to repre- 
sent everything this hard fought bat- 
tle stood for. 

It was no more than an empty oak- 
en bucket, grabbed off the end of the 
weathered, backless bench by a lone 
guard who saw littJc action that day. 

This empty bucket, however, was 
not just any bucket to the players 
that day. It was a symbol of every- 
thing good that day, and the winners 
who took it home with them could 
look at it, touch it, and remember. 

The losers now had something not 
so abstract as price and glory to re- 
mind ihcm during the off-season 
what hard work could get back. 

Hit fast forward on the VCR built 
by History, playing the tape titled 
Time, up to a point 68 years past 
this day. 

The scene is familiar, yet differenL 
Thousands of fans fill steel concrete 
bleachers sun^ounding a plush, ge- 
netically improved grass field. 

Futuristic warriors battle with 
polyethylene covered elbow and 
arm pads, helmets with connected 
face masks and sun shields hiding 
any glimpse of a player's face, and 
radio headsets allowing communica- 
tion between coaches on the field 
and coaches suspended over the sta- 
dium in a protective glass box add to 



the new atmosphere. 

But wait a minute! What is that 
over there? Could it be? It is! The 
old oaken bucket sitiing on a trophy 
stand on the Indiana sideline. 

The empty bucket is stilt around, 
representing an intense rivalry be- 
tween two Indiana schools. Many 
of the players from that tradition 
starting game arc gone, but what 
they played for still exists today. 

Notes on the Old Oaken Bucket 
series: 

-Purdue won this year by a score of 
13-10, giving them the same record 
as Indiana in the Big Ten at 3-5/ 
-Indiana had won the two previous 
games in 1991 and 1990. 
-Overall, Purdue leads the Old Oak- 
en Bucket series 44-21-3, and leads 
the entire Indiana-Purdue matchups 
58-31-6.

Gibson leads IPFW 



By Joe Heersche 
Sports Editor 

Senior Scan Gibson picked up 
where he left off last season, leading 
the IPFW men's basketball team to a 
77-68 victory over Sl Francis. 

Gibson was the leading scorer 
with 26 points and reminiscent of 
last season's shooting accuracy, hit 
8-11 from the field and 9-9 from the 
free-throw line in IPFW's season 
opener. 

One category Gibson was unchar- 
acteristically unproductive in was 
rebounding. Last season Gibson set 
the career rebounding record, aver- 
aging over nine rebounds per game. 

Pat Murphy had six rebounds and 
Lan Bullard added five as the 
Mastodons totaled only 21 re- 
bounds. The Cougars matched 
IPFW in rebounds with six from 
Mike Shafcr. 

Besides rebounding, the Cougars 
were able to play the Mastodons 
close in most statistical categories. 
Sl Francis hit 15 of 22 free-throws 
and IPFW scored on 17 of their 23 
attempts- Both teams attempted 48 
field goals. IPFW connecting on 28 
and the Cougars 23. 

The similarities also were apparent 
in three-point shooting, assists, and 
turnovers. 

Scott Simmons hit two three-point 
field goals for the Mastodons who 



had a total of six. Shafcr also led the 
Cougars in ihrcc-point shots, hiulng 
three of three, nearly half the team's 
seven. 

IPFW had 12 assists and the 
Cougars 10, and turnovers were just 
as close with 16 for Sl. Francis and 
14 for IPFW. 

The Mastodons caught themselves 
playing catch up early after Sl Fran- 
cis jumped to a 16-4 lead on their 
home court 

However , as statistically close as 
the game appeared, the Cougars 
never led after IPFW went up by 
one. 23-22. 

By half-time the Mastodons had 
extended their lead to 14, with a 
score of 43-29. 

The Cougars eventually fell be- 
hind by 19 in the second half before 
they began a late charge. 

The Cougars charge got them as 
close as nine points before five ex- 
pired in the game. 

Both teams ended the game with 
two players in double figures. Sim- 
mons of IPFW added ten to Gib- 
son's 26. 

For the Cougare, Shafer was high- 
scorer with 18 and Land added 15. 

The Mastodon's next game is 
tonight at Purdue-Calumet and then 
the Mastodons face Tri-Statc on 
Dec. 7, in Angola.
