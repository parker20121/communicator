IPFW employee files 
civil rights complaint 
against university 

ByWAVN'ESTEFFEN 

Edltor-ln .Chief 

One present and ore former IPFW employee have filed complaints against Ihe 
university with the Indiana Civil Rights Commission. 

Charlene Edgar has charged sexual discrimination In salary and James Barry 
said he was nol promoted because of his handicap, Barry's right arm has been 
ampulatcd IkIdw the elbow 

Edgar, an academic consullanl in computing and data processing, clalma thai 
she is not being paid as much asa man doingsimilar work inherdeparlmenl. 

"I was hired part-lime last Febmary, wilh the understanding that I would be 
mode a full-time employee, tfe was hired full-llmc in March," Edgar said, "On 
September 30, 1 was offered q full-tlmeposilion with a salary of $17,&amp;oo a year. Tile 
man was already making $22,000," 

"I was told that, because he was an expert on one system, IhalhewasenliUedlD 
more money. But, I have lobe a near-expert on six systems, and I have a budget lo 
tahecareof and to be responsible for. and he doesn't." 

When asked to respond, William Bcnncll, director ot Computing and Dale 
Processing, said. "I don'l feel It would be appropriate to this case to drag Ihls out. 
These mailers arc being handled by Ihe proper administrative and legal process. I 
don't think there has been any dlscrlmlnallon. That's a fact," 

Barry has worked as a temporary, parl-lime employee in Ihe Child CareCenler, 
Physical Plant and Language Lab. He said thai he had applied for full, port-lime 
stalus several limes and had been turned down. 

Full, part-time slalus means Ihal Ihe employee Is entitled \o vacation lime, 
insurance and other benefits that Ihe temporary employee Is not, according to a 
spokesperson in personnel, 

"I have applied for many positions on campus and have been turned down. 
Once, when 1 was applying for a mail clerk Job, I was qualified according to (he 
posted job description, but was told during the interview of other duties of the Job 
which disqualified me." Barry said, 

"When Jim was hired. It was wilh Ihe undersl^nding that he was lemporary," 
said John Camaghi. vice-chancellor for financial affairs. "The chancellor gave 
him some extra hours In Ihe Language Lab, alter he was discharged from Ihe 
Physical Plant. Ihatwere not originally budgeted for, Inordcrlogivehlm a chance 
to have so me time la look at other options, "he said. 

"There is work on Ihe campus UiQl 1 am qualified lo do, I am being held back."

The proposed IPFW animal care

whether or not it docs will tie decided in 
the state legislature, 

"l( it is going Id gel funding, Car- 
naghi said, it has to be at Ihe legislative 
level." 

The proposal will go before the In- 
diana House Ways and Means Com- 
mittee, which reviews all budget 
mailers, and if passed, goes before Ihe 
General Assembly. 

Carnaghi said he eipccls Ihe Ways 
and Means Commiltce lo give Ihe 
proposal Eimilar rating as did the 
commission, but declined comment on 



what Ihe General Assembly may do, 

Bruce Abbolt. assistant professor of 
psychology ond chairman of Ihe animal 
care facility, said in an interview 
earlier Ihis year, "In this etonomic 
climate, other projects may receive a 
higher marking than an animal care 
laollity. There's a limit on Ihc amount 
of money available." 

"All those Items ranked 'critical' (by 
Ihe commission), wilt probably get 
funding," Camaghi said. "Worthwhile, 
but nol pressing issues are really Iheir 
bottom category." 

Carnaghi remained optimistic, 
because he said the Alhlelic Center 
received a similar ranking before Ihe 
slnrl of ils conslruction. With Ihe work 
of local legislators and lobbying efforts 
on behalf of the campus, howevr. slate 
legislators voted lo fund Ihe center. 

The campus is nol requesling up-

The bonds are paid back wilh money

"Out of the $37.50 fee. J1I.9S ot tl goes 
to pay off existing debts. The state

sold. 

If Ihe $990,000 facllily receives fun- 
ding, the facility will mosl likely be 
located in Ihe field northwest of Ihe 
Alhlelic Center near Ihe Chiller Plant. 

The 9,000 square fool building would

State cutback could

Laitweek.EPFWiludenlarecelveda notice 
attached to their fee itatemeni* during 
reglitrBtlon wamlnglhem they might have lo 
pay a surcharge lacked on lo their present 
student lees. 

IPFW students have seen the cost ol a 
ihree-credit'hour class rise CS In the last two 
years, and could possibly face another rise In 
claaafeesneil fall. The last thing they need Is 
to pay more money for their education after 
already paying lor It. 

There was obviously a lack of financial 
planning In Ihe slate government, and 
because of that. Ihe slate Is predicted to face a 
Uil million deficit by June 30. !»}. 

Because of Ihla predicted deficit. Governor 
Orr told the preildents of lU. Purdue. Ball 



Stale. Indiana State, Vlncennes, and IVY 
Tech funds could be cut to their loatltutlons. 

Since IPFW is pari of (he Purdue syitem, 
Purdue Preiidenl John HIcka told IPFW to 
warn llssludenlaoln possible surcharge, but 
what were IPFW and Purdue West Lafayette 
Eupposcd In ck) The state said IPFW could 
counl on gelling tn. 3 million as the result of a 
budget bill passed last March. Now the atale 
Is saying It might take some ol thai money 
away Because IPFW warned Its students of a 
possible surcharge, it looks bad In the eyes of 
lis students and in the community, but the 
stale will tic the real Indian giver If studenta 
end up paying this surcharge. 

Why should students have to refigtu'e their 
tudgets to pay for the slate's mlslake.

In San Francisco, he 
"[Doled around tor a long i 
time in poverty, lending a

concentrating on ort more 
fervently than ever. He 
studied Chinese brush 
pointing with some of the 
finest teachers in tbe ctly. 
sludied printmaking al Fort

Alter Coffey curated a 
show at Arllink in 1380, he 
was interviewed for bis 
current posllion by the 
Board of Directors and made 
the decision lo return to the 
Midwest. "Through the help 
of a good Harvard lawyer," 
be gained custody of his 
daughter who became one of 
his reasons for accepting the 
position wllh Artlink and 
iPFW, leaving behind the 
trendy new-wave Wg city 
scene for tbe slower pace of 
Fort Wayne. 

"1 wanted lo alow her 
down," he said. 

Becoming a father made 
him grow upa lilUebll more, 
become more disciplined, he 
said. "1 still know a lot of 
artisls who are afraid of 
kids," Colley is nol afraid, 
not even of tbe responsibility 
ol being a single parenL 



Colley 's Irish eyes sparkle 
as he Ulks of future showsal 
ArUink. His ■'lovTirile show" 
on Ihe upcoming agenda 
is entitled "Urban 
Shamanism" and will bring 
together artisls from Ft. 
Wayne and San Francisco 
The show will have "one eye 
to tbe primitive and one eye 

lechoology " TTie opening 
will be a real event, very 
exciting. Colfey said He Is 
curious as lo whelher or not 
tbe Ft, Wayne public will be 
receptive. Will he be able to 
arouse their curiosity? 

"I am involved, in my 
work, wilb unlveisals —life, 
death, passion, love, bale," 
Colfey said. He feels his 
artistic ideas are sometimes 
misconstruci He Is asking 
people to think, to explore as

He could travel in the

four games he thinks Ihings 
are a little bit dearer,

Russell felt that the 
Ashland game was a bigslep 
toward proving Ihat IPFW 
can compete in NCAA

that "total concentration and

The IPFW women's basketball team opened the 1982-B3 
season with a convincing B9^ win over the Lady Oilers of 
flndiay, 

" Forward Rhonda Unverferth took the opening Upoff and 
scored. Secoods later, Unverferth made another basket, 
giving IPFW a 4-0 lead, and the Tuskers never looked back. 

The Tuskers were energetic and ready despite the tipoH 
being delayed 45 minutes. The Findlay team's bus broke 
down on the way into Fort Wayne. 

Fifteen minutes into the game. IPFW led IM. Itiey ledS4-

Teamwork and offensive play keyed the victory. "Tbe 
team's offense was pretty impressive." said coach Kirk 
Kavanaugh. "Our guards played very well." 

Although Ihe Tuskers played good offense. Kavanau^ felt 
the defense could have been better. "My main concern was 

had several breakdowns. But the guard spots played well." 

Despite 27 Tusker fouls, Findlay was never in ihe game. 

Leading the way for the Tuskers were Unverferth, Deb 
Krouse and Laurc Renningcr, all with 16 points apiece. Rita 
Boyle and Renninger had sbc and five assists respectively. 
Charlotle Wilson came off the bench to pull down five 
rebounds, while four other pla}'ers had four ri^unds apiece. 

fPF^ dropped Findlay, but Kavanaugh said there is more 
work lo be done fora successfui season. "The teamand 1 fell 
we should have Ewred higher," he said. "And, lo be suc- 
cessful, we will have to Improve on defease in future games. 
It will come down lo execution offensively and defensively,

As the sports editor here 
the past semester, I've at-

lo be small, but toyal. I

IPFW has a beautiful 
athletic facility on the

longer a good excuse. 

This spring, the baseball
