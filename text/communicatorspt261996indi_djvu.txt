Would-be students keep financial aid 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
Chief Reporter 



Every year thousands of students 
apply for financial aid Many stu- 
dents are not rewarded with the 
amount of money they wished for and there- 
fore decide lo "cut back" on their classes. 
Yet there are those who are given a substan- 
tial amount and never plan on attending 
classes. 

Nearly 40 percent of the 1PFW student 
body receives federal financial aid. 
According to a memo sent to all faculty 
members last week, the federal government 



believes a number of these recipients are 
simply walking away with the money. 

On Sept. 17, the memo, from Fenwick 
English, vice chancellor of academic affairs 
and Frank Bore Li, vice chancellor of student 
affairs, asked all faculty to take attendance 
in class in order to see which students were 
actually attending. 

"The federal government knows they 
(students) took the money," said English. 
"They simply want to know if they are 
attending class. It is not an insubstantial 
number of students here." 

According to English and Borelli, IPFW 
is required, under federal audit guidelines, 
to ensure that students who receive such 
funds are, in fact, attending class. 



If the campus does not demonstrate that 
these students are actually in class then they 
are liable lo relum the funds, The amount of 
money thought lo be in the bands of absent 
students is estimated at $196,000, based on 
the number of students who received Title 
IV funds last year. 

"It (the money) could come from our 
budget," said English 

If taken from the budget, less money 
would be given to several organizations 
throughout the campus 

Since IPFW does not offer dorms on 
campus, students are allowed lo use the 
money to pay for rem and food. 
Nevertheless, the main purpose is for it to be 
used for academic fees 



English says thai professors may simply 
turn in grades. For instance, if a student sud- 
denly stopped attending class, the professor 
could turn in the last grade and date at which 
the student was present- 
According to Robert M. Zellers, director 
of financial aid, nearly 10,000 students 
applied for financial aid last year. Seventy- 
nine students who were given financial aid 
finished the academic year with no passing 
grades, therefore contributing to the money 
thai IPFW is responsible for paying back. 

"We try to bill the student to recover any 
aid thai ihey received," said Zellers. He says 
the chances of gelling the money is "slim to 
none." 

Through the process of taking atten- 



dance, administrators hope to catch students 
without involving the federal government in 
the investigation. 

"The federal government basically says 
you (students who receive financial aid) are 
guilty until proven innocent," said Zellers. 

Since a procedure needs to be in place by 
October, the Academic Affairs Committee 
and Faculty Affairs Committee agreed to 
monitor attendance (his fall with class lists 
from the end of the third and ninth week of 
the semester. 

Further discussion between faculty and 
administrative offices during the semester 
may require modification of the procedure 
for future terms 



Administrative evaluations 
inconsistent across campus 



by Paul Tupper 
Editor 

The faculty of IPFW is comparing apples 
to oranges, if anything at all. 

According to a panel discussion of the 
IPFW Chapter of the American Association 
of University Professors (AAUP) on Sept. 
23, each school has a different method for 
evaluating administrators, which includes 
the chancellor, vice chancellors, deans and 
depanment chairs. Two schools, Fine and 
Performing Arts and Business, do not have 
a process for evaluating administrators. 

Michael Downs, chair and associate pro- 
fessor of political science and a panel mem- 
ber, said that evaluations should be consis- 
tent 

"I think for an evaluation to be useful, it 
must be formal and regular," Downs said. 

But Downs met some resisiance After 
the panel discussion, Steve Hollander, assis- 
tant professor of English and linguistics, 
stated he thinks diversity among evaluation 
methods is appropriate. 

"I'm sick and tired of hearing calls for 
consistent evaluations," said Hollander. 
"We are a diverse-enough campus to use 
different evaluation methods." 

Other panelists included Richard Hess. 
associate professor of communication', Bill 
Frederick, associate professor of computer 



science; and Jim Hersberger, associate pro- 
fessor of mathematical sciences. 

The AAUP created the upward feedback 
questionnaire, which is rec^rrunertdtd by 
the association to evaluate administrators. 
Currently, Health Sciences and the school of 
Public and Environmental Affairs are the 
only schools using the upward feedback 
questionnaire. The chancellor's office also 
uses the questionnaire. 

Some attending the discussion worried 
about the confidentiality of evaluations. 
According to the AAUP Redbook. a sum- 
mary of the review, including a statement of 
actions taken as a result of the review, must 
be published, with respect to the confiden- 
tiality of the administrator being evaluated. 

Student evaluations of iheir educators are 
not made available to ihe public, because. 
according lo Downs, IPSGA docs not pay 
for the evaluations or oversee publication. 
Only the head of students government eval- 
uates administrators on administrative 
duties 

Evaluations of the administration, 
according to the AAUP Redbook, must also 
reflect the views of those who work close to 
that administrator, be periodic, and have a 
goal of improving the performance of the 
administrator.

NASA experts speak

Editor 



Right from the start, Mark Brown, 
Purdue and retired NASA astronaut, answered the 
question that was on everyone's mind. 
"How do you go lo the bathroom in

"1 remember watching Neil walk on the moon, as I 

had jusi graduated high school, jusi in awe of what I

Hansen talked about the future of space exploration 
by using the diaries of past rocke-

ration. He argued that not only

Personal hygiene wasn't the whole of Brown's 
speech. He gave a presentation of the history of NASA 
and the role he played as an astronaut. He talked about 
the rise in interest with the Apollo mission and Neil 
Armstrong's famous moonwalk in 1969. a moment

Political drug war 
just posturing 



Bill Clinton is responsible for 
the drug use in America. At 
least that is what Bob Dole 
and (be Republicans say. 

They (ibe GOP) say Clintons 
remorse about not inhaling causes 
more young people lo use and abuse 
drugs. We cannot speak for anyone 
else, but we doubt whether the pres- 
ident inhaled has any bearing on 
whether Johnny rolls a "fatly" 

tonight. 

We agree 
that drugs are a 
problem in 

America. Our 
cities are war 
zones and the 
police are under- 
staffed and out- 
gunned

culture, but is Clinton really at 
fault? 

We disagree with Dole using a 
30-year-old mistake by Clinton to 
give an adrenaline shot for his cam- 
paign. With this move Dole looks 
desperate — like someone willing to 
do anything snort of calling tbe 
president a child molester to gel 
elected. 

Clinton is no better than Dole 
_^^__^^_ when it comes to 
the drug issue. He 
talks about how 
tough he is on drug 
dealers. He advo- 
cates the death 
penalty for capital 
crimes concerning 
drugs, but very lit-

possibility of legalizing drugs. 
Could anyone imagine a battle 
between Belmont Beverage and 
Cap'n Cork over booze turf rights? 

The last time anyone saw a bat- 
tle over booze was during prohibi- 
tion And when they legalized 
liquor the battles stopped. We do 
have a legacy from our brief prohi- 
bitionist legacy — it's called the

We are not advocating legaliza-

Letters to the editor 



Support troops, realize obligation 



■by Paul Tupper, Editor 



To the editor, 

This letter is in response to the 
staff editorial about the U.S. 
involvement in Iraq ("U.S. needs 
to define mission in Iraq," The 
Communicator, Sept. 12 1996). 
While I agree with some valid 
points in the editorial, I cannot 
help but wonder why it is we are 
still questioning our interests in tbe 
Middle East, (i.e. oil, exports and 
political). Not only this, but we 
have "Hitler Jr." attempting lo flex 
his military prowess. 

As a nation of world super-

humanity to ensure that what hap-

Understandably, we must not

Bork, Oprah rock world, campus 




even 



Censobshif ruled the U.S. FOR 

175'TEA1tS7.'L- ' ■■ ■ 

Last night in a fit of homework 
rage and apathetic fury, I turned my 
Magnavox to CNBC. Occasionally, 
I catch Geraldo bitching about O.J. 
beating the rap or some other dead 
horse. But last night, I saw the 
scariest thing I've ever seen on tele- 
vision — Tbe Cal Thomas Show 
with special guest. . . Robert Bork. 
(Scarier than when I saw "The 
Exorcist" for the first time) 

Just to clarify. . . Thomas is a 
syndicated columnist who makes G. 
Gordon Liddy look like a pansy — 
Bork is a former Supreme Court 
nominee who was rejected because 
of his strict interpretations of The 
Constitution, 

"We had censorship for 175 
years in this country and we got 
along very well with it." Bork 
mused. 

One of the biggest evils facing 
tbe nation is the Supreme Court, 
Bork stressed. He constantly called 
the justices serving on the Court lib- 



erals 

though a 

majority of 
those justices 
were appointed 
by either 

Reagan or 
Bush. 

Even more 
disturbing 
than bork 

EK._BjORK? 

While 
choking down another cigarette last 
week outside, I heard two men talk- 
ing about life, liberty and Oprah. . . 
they go together 

Both were just amazed that 
Oprah made so much money for 
what she does. She talks to people. 
Just for a talk show she makes $171 
million over the last two years, they 
said. 

There is a point here and here it 
comes. One of the men said: 

"I can't believe she has a talk 
show and her only qualification was 
she was raped once." 

Just bow many times should 
she have been raped before she gels 
a talk show??????!!!! Mill 

Just one rape ... in a perfect 
world this guy would be lucky 
enough to be raped by some scary 
man with a history of sodomizing 
men in prison. 

Maybe he'd get a show . . . 
He'd be qualified. Maybe someone 
else could rape him again and he'd 
get twice as mucb money than 
Oprah. 



Who really plays God? 




ers "private" 
affairs to "play 
God," despite 
Feint popular opin- 



elley 



Every time I get into a heated 
debate with someone, I begin to 
anticipate a catchy, prepared phrase 
such as "Judge not, lest ye be 
judged!" often when the other has 
exhausted either all other recourse 
or all other patience. 

SOVEREIGNTY: Another 
favorite is akin to "Who made you 
God?" or "You can't play God 
here." 

Once and for all, Christians are 
not out to rule the world, kill Jews 
or enslave Negroes and we don't 
benignly or cold-heartedly rule oth- 



PRIVA- 
CY. Any 

action should 
- remain private 

r *&lt;Wl* ChC only so long as 

*3fofj no one else is 
^ eec * affected. Very 
few people 
will disagree 
in principle, 
but when tbe rubber meets the road, 
a different mode of thought pre- 
vails. Abortion is not a private 
issue; this is not based upon its pub- 
lic divisiveness or the deep places 
people hold it in their hearts. 
Abortion is murder, and it is public; 
I have had surprisingly few pro- 
choicers argue the first point. 
Tensions flare about the second one. 
LOGIC; If indeed the fetus is 
not alive, but only an extension of 
its mother, then it is not murder, 
because no killing is involved. But 
if it is alive by itself (viability not 



withstanding), then abortion is mur- 
der. While few (some will) maintain 
a certainty about the fetus' lack of 
substance, ever and anon people tell 
me to "Not play God" with them. 

Who's playing God here? 

SCENARIO: The classic case 
served for abortion's reasonable- 
ness is tbe dubious but plausible 
case wbere the mother's life is in 
jeopardy due lo the pregnancy. 
While the abortion industry is more 
widespread today, encompassing a 
raie of 80 percent, for convenience 
reasons by the polls, this is a suffi- 
cient place to start 

IF ... : The mother may or may 
not survive the pregnancy. Suppose 
the mother decides not to terminaie 
the pregnancy. She dies; it was in 
the hands of God, whose role we 
didn't play. We simply let the preg- 
nancy continue. This isn't to say 
that we include her in our statistics 
and coolly go on, but the mass mur- 
der of the unborn, under any nicer 
name, even for supposedly compas- 
sionate reasons, is still monstrous. 

She lives; it was in the hands of 
God, whose role we didn't play, and 



He displayed some grace to the rest 
of us. And yes, we should still use 
all proper means to keep both moth- 
er an child alive. 

ELSE ... : Suppose the mother 
terminates the pregnancy and 
increases her survival rate. Well and 
good, 1 suppose, but humans, sig- 
nificantly less than all-knowing and 
all-powerful, made an arbitrary 
decision to kill someone for sure to 
save someone not-so-for sure. Is it 
me, or is this a bit convoluted? With 
the well-intentioned effort to insure 
somebody, we annulled another 
being who may have bad now- 
unknown affects on his/her world. 
We played God. 

SO THEN ... : Natural laws 
exist as boundaries beyond which 
bidden and indeterminate dangers 
lurk. If we attempt to transcend 
them, we only do so to our misfor- 
tune. They are not bludgeons used 
by a cosmic killjoy to keep man 
cowed. They were designed, and 
are placed, for our ullimate protec- 
tion, including those who cannot 
protect themselves.

Condom placement sexist 




The best thing about being a 
gay couple, according lo Jerry 
Seinfeld, is ihe doubling of one's 
wardrobe upon sharing living quar- 
ters. This is true, but the subject 
goes beyond clothing The same 
holds true for health and beauty 
supplies 

Of course, by sharing such 
items as toothpaste, cologne and 
razor blades (but not deodorant, 
that's just too personal to share 
with anyone), this means the sup- 
plies run out faster than if you were 
single Such an occurrence hap- 
pened this weekend 

I was instructed (and all of you 
husbands know what I mean by 
"instructed") to pick up a package 
of razor blades when I ran a short 
errand for a light bulb, also a bath- 
room necessity I went to the 
Parkwest Scott's in an attempt to 
save time. 

Before entering the store to 
fulfill my husbandly duty, I had 
already bad some issues with this 



particular 
Scott's gro- 
cery store. In 
the past, when 
I was sent to 
do virtually 
the same task, 
but this time 
the object of 
need was cake 
flour. I was in 
disgust to 
leam this 
store did not 
carry cake 
flour What grocery store in the 
world doesn't carry cake flour?! 
Isn't flour an item grocery stores 
must carry in order to quality for 
grocery storehood? 

For this reason, and because 
the clerks at the Coventry Scott's 
arc cuter, 1 began traveling much 
farther to shop. But this was an 
emergency, so I gave Parkwest 
another shot, trying to put my dis- 
dain for this particular store aside. 
I went directly for the easy-to- 
find razor blades. 
So far, so good. 
Upon finding the razor blades 
(Track II, for any of you who might 
care), I noticed yet another thing 
that offended me 

The managers of this particular 
Scott's, in their infinite sexist wis- 
dom, decided to display the con- 
doms near the men's shaving gear. 
In the past, I noticed other 
Scott's stores would display their 
condoms near other forms of birth 



Walking in the pasture, 
learning the rules 




I've been attending IPFW for 
about a month, and I'd be lying if I 
said it was a breeze. It was quite an 
adjustment to return to that 
"rushed" schedule that bad been so 
laid back for the last three months. 

All students out there who 
started core classes, all parents who 
added the title of "students" to their 
resume and all professors who 
came to meet those "bright, shiny 
faces" in late August know exactly 
what I mean. 

For the majority of people who 
don't know me — this is my first 
semester at IPFW I transferred 
from Taylor University in Upland 
and am majoring in English. 

I went to that tiny speck of a 
town (which includes cornfields, a 
Shell station and Taylor) last year 
intending to spend four years on a 
conservative Christian campus, 
eventually heading into the min- 
istry as the senior pastor of a 
church. 

You sec . I'm a believer No. 
not a member of an exclusive reli- 
gion, but a man who holds faith in 
the fact that a dirty Middle Eastern 
carpenter was killed on an instru- 
ment of torture for claiming to be 
the Son of God — then, beating 
death and proving the claim true 

But Taylor seemed like an 
exclusive club. I decided to make a 
change IPFW is a slight departure 
from the path 1 bad picked, but the 
confidence I felt walking on cam- 
pus was the kind of bean-warming 
assurance one can only feel while 
choosing to walk in God's path 

Going from class to class is 
exciting to say the least. While 
being enveloped by the chatter and 
cigarette smoke, 1 see people of all 
ages and races and from all walks 
of life. 1 see rich kids with Tommy 
Hilfiger shirts and middle class 
conservatives. 

I see girls with pink hair, nose 



mothers who r 



rings, baggy jeans 
and long chains 
connecting their 
belt buckles with 
their wallets. I see 
guys who look 
scared to death 
and are content to 
exist in their thick 
novels carried 
with them every- 
where. 

I see coura- 
geous 40- year-old 
um to school only 
to confront the embarrassing task 
of setting up their e-mail accounts 
in the computer labs — on machines 
they've never touched. 

I see guys with long, straggly 
hair and black T-shirts with the 
names of heavy metal bands I've 
never heard of. I see students who 
wear sunglasses ail day and take 
their discman headphones off only 
long enough to respond to the pro- 
fessor's roll call. I see guys who are 
in the same place everyday — con- 
versing not in English, but in their 
native tongue. 

I see myself strolling in an out 
of these crowds, not saying a word. 
In this new environment and 
campus, the Holy Spirit has 
become my adviser. The textbook 
be recommends most often is John 
and the quotes come from Chapter 
10. 

My Jesus says, "I am the good 
shepherd; I know my sheep and my 
sheep know me . . , and I lay down 
my life for my sheep." 

In this new pasture of life, God 
is teaching me to look past the bro- 
ken down wood of the fence, to 
keep walking through the crap, to 
ignore the stench of animals and to 
see the sheep. 

Yes, now I see we are all 
sheep — all known and created by 
God. As this new year starts to roll. 
I am excited to see what God has in 
store for His flock. 

John also says, ". . . if we love 
one another, God lives in us and his 
love is made complete ." (1 John 
4:12) Because that's true, each per- 
son that I've come in contact with 
who has let me take a peek into 
their hean has brought me a little 
closer to Him than I was before. 

Thank you God. for creating 
this masterpiece called the human 
race. Thank you, fellow students — 
see you in the pasture. 



control, lubricant or feminine 
hygiene products. That, to me. 
seems like a more appropriate place 
to put condoms. Have the managers 
of Scott's not been listening? 
Condom clientele is not just male. 

The latter eighties and early 
nineties taught us that women need 
to be just as careful. That it should 
not be a taboo for women to carry 
condoms in their purse. Parkwest 
Scott's is sending out a clear mes- 
sage: Condoms are for the men to 
buy and women who do are sluts. 

Truth is. if we left the condom 
buying to heterosexual men, not 
many would be bought. Just saying 
to a man "Have one or get none" 
hasn't worked and the women have 
done a good job picking up the 
slack. The women know what 
could happen if they have sex with- 
out the proper protection. And they 
know, thanks to Ricki, Oprah and 
Sally, what can happen if you turn 
down a homy man. So they've col- 
lectively (but not entirely, for het- 
erosexual women are the fastest 
group getting HTV) decided to be 
protected. Why on Earth would 
Parkwest Scott's want to discour- 
age such a wise practice? 

So here I have yet another rea- 
son not to shop Parkwest Scott's. 
But with my blood boiling from the 
condom display, I forgot to get the 
light bulb. 

Hopefully the spouse won't 
notice (yeah, right). 




How extensive is it? 

How does it affect children? 

Can abusers change? 

What can be done to stop it?

Journey to Diversity 



by Paul Tupper 
Editor 




Commonplace, a nonprofit center 
to connect citizens, community and 
ideas, speak on the issue. 

The keynote address by Guinier 
took place Sept. 12, at the 
"Enhancing Minority Attainment 
VI" conference at Indiana 
University Kokomo. 

When arguing on the side of 
Affirmative Action, Guinier 



by Paul Tupper 
Editor 



How does Affirmative Action 
affect gays and lesbians? It's sim- 
ple Work can be bard for many 
gays and lesbians (ask anyone who 
has tried to work for the Cracker 
Barrel, where they have fired indi- 
viduals on the sole basis or sexual 



explained that judging by merit 
alone would be fine if the elements 
everyone brought lo the table of a 
men l (est were the same. 

According to the research done 
by Guinier, college students whose 
parents made over $70,000 a year 
fared better the first and second 
year of college than students whose 
parents made $20,000. 

To me, this makes sense because 
my parents are much closer to the 
latter figure than the former. Not 
only are my parents unable to help 
me with the finances of college, 
meaning I have to work to support 
my education and myself, but (hey 
were not able lo send me to the 
"better" schools and give me the 
"better" tools lo help me with my 
education. I didn't have a comput- 
er I didn't have tutors helping me 
in limes of need. So this concept of 
socioeconomics in determining 
class performance, to me, is valid. 

She also pointed out (hat the test 
by which college students are 



picked is not completely fair. For 
instance, the SAT test, she argued, 
is designed for the male white stu- 
dent. 

To support this argument, 

Guinier gave 

statistics on 



the scores of 
males versus 
females. She 
was able to 
show data

test-lakers do 
not perform

is certainly needed 
to give all those 

who are not white 
men a better 
opportunity to 

compete fairly for 
those desired 

places in society " 



timed tests 

The SAT is a 

timed test. 

So females, right off ihe bat, start 

off with a disadvantage over males 

who take the test. 

To pull these two ideas together, 
students whose parents made more 
money had access to the software 
programs, the SAT classes and the 
test itself. We all know that by tak- 



A Gay Perspective 



orientation). Jobs should be divided 
fairly, and until there is a fair 
method. Affirmative Action is still 
needed. 

With the recent vole from the 
Senate that shot down a bill thai 
would noi let gays be discriminated 
against on ihe job, our support for 
Affirmative Action is very crucial. 

This is a hard concept to accept 
by some gay men because of the 



recent finding that suggested gay 
male households grossed more 
income than any other lifestyle But 
lei's flip the coin. 

Gay men may make more, but 
that is because they are men. What 
about our lesbian sisters? Since 
women still make $.75 to a white 
man's dollar, it is clear thai job and 
pay equably affects the gay com- 
munity. A gay man doing well 



ing the SAT on several occasions, 
we will do better on the test. But 
thai test costs money, and those 
parents who made less money 
could not provide the opportunities 

for their child to lake the 

test as often. 

Now, when you look at 
the data that says African- 
American men make less 
than white men, 

Hispanic/Latino men make 
less than white men. and all 
women make less than 
white men. it is easy to see 
why Guinier wins her argu- 
ment. 

This system of merit, or 
"meritocracy." is set up to 
better aid die white male. So it is 
evident Affirmative Action is cer- 
tainly needed (o give all those who 
are not while men a better opportu- 
nity to compete fairly for those 
desired places in society. 



financially does not make up for 
the lesbian who makes only 51.50 
to the gay man's $2. 

The same goes for our gay 
Hispanic friends. And our gay 
black friends and our gay Jewish 
friends. When gays and lesbians 
think about the universal impact of 
no Affirmative Action, it is clear we 
need to help keep this program 
alive.

Staff Writer 

Fever, migraine headaches and 
vomiting axe all reasons people 
schedule appointments with a physi- 
cian. Irritability, sleeping problems, 
weight loss or gain, lack of energy, 
difficulty in con- 
centrating, low 
self-esteem, 
social withdraw- 
al I . morbid 
thoughts during H flft s 
daily activities, 
waves of anxiety, 
and feelings of 
hopelessness are n 
all reasons 10 Don Smith 
seek professional 

treatment according to Don Smith, a 
personal counselor here on campus. 

Mental health, like physical 
health, is something which everyone 
should lake an active interest in. 




Tbe occasional menial check-up is 
necessary 10 make sure everything is 
in good working order. The above 
list describes common symptoms of 
severe problems which tend lo 
develop this lime of year. Just like 
tending to physical illnesses, people 
need to [real menial illnesses 
According to Smith, there are "a loi 
of wounded walking people" on ibis 
campus. 

Anyone experiencing similar 
symptoms, or jusl curious aboul bis 
or ber menial health, is encouraged 
lo schedule an appointment with 
Smith. Treatment is available and 
only a phone call away; IPFW stu- 
dents are entitled to seven free ses- 
sions each semester. 

Another way lo receive assistance 
is to take pan in tbe National 
Depression Screening, lo be held in 
Walb Memorial Union, Room 222, 
on Oct. 24 at noon. 

According lo Smith, many people 



wbo are suffering from a mental ill- 
ness do not even realize it "'I'm 
just a weak person,' they say." 
explained Smith. Kelp is available 
for anyone experiencing these feel- 
ings. Clinical depression is a very 
definable and treatable problem. 
The first step to treatment is seeking 
it early. Treating a small problem is 
easier than treating a larger problem 
down ihe line. 

Smith calls himself "your user- 
friendly therapist." He spends the 
first few sessions just getting to 
know a patient. He is concerned 
with details about a person's life, 
medical history, and relationships 
with family members. Treatment 
can begin with a simple conversa- 
tion. 

Aside from depression. Smitb 
finds various other mental illnesses 
on campus. Very common during 
the winter is Seasonal Affective 
Disorder, which causes some to fall 



into depression due to shorter day- 
light hours. He also finds many stu- 
dents dealing with stress-related 
anxiety. 

Occasionally, what appears to be 
a mental illness is actually a physi- 
cal illness. For example, depression 
and diabetes can be linked. By 
investigating one's mental feelings, 
a person may actually uncover a 
physical problem which can be easi- 
ly treated. 

The on -campus depression 
screening is sponsored by the 
department of human resources 
Smith will be the main speaker 
Before the screening, be plans to 
discuss different kinds of depres- 
sion, including symptoms and treat- 
ments. 

While depression is still some- 
what of a mystery, ihe picture is 
becoming more clear. "We know a 
lot more loan we did," Smith said 
Many factors come lo play in the 



cause of depression A predisposi- 
tion to depression is likely to run in 
families. If a relative suffers from 
depression, other family members 
may have a predisposition to the 
disorder. All ii takes is an encounter 
with the right set of circumstances to 
ingger such a stale. 

These circumslances include 
stress, juggling school and work, 
poor diet, weather, alcohol and drug 
use. Smith emphasized the effect of 
alcohol and drugs in depression 
Many people do not believe they 
have a problem with drugs or alco- 
hol, when in reality they do. Smith 



practices confidentiality and will not 
report drug use lo ihe police, but be 
does recommend treatment. While 
Smith encourages people to get help 
for their problems, he admits thera- 
py is not for everyone "I'm not out 
promoting people who gel into psy- 
chotherapy," says Smith. Affordable 
help can be found on campus In 
addition to that. Smith recommends 
talking lo a friend, peer, minister, 
rabbi, priest or anyone else they can 
turn to for help 




War, what is it good for... Movies 



by Nol Beckky 
Managing Editor 

During the last year, I periodical- 
ly wrote a piece called "Editor's 
Picks . " Bui I am no longer editor 
of this paper, and "Managing 
Editor's Picks?" . . . sounds too 
wordy. I covered things like base- 
ball movies, ultimate CD collec- 
tions, date movies, dead people I 
would like to dine with, and ulti- 
mate book collections 

One of those features actually 
ended the lives of the usual gang of 
contributors (i.e. idiots) I called 
upon to assist this fea- 
ture. Now I have 
recruited several other 
contributors/idiots to 
assist this next incarna- 
tion of "TEditor's Picks 




We were sitting 
around swilling Jolt and 
Yahoo soda, when 
"Kelly's Heroes" came 
on cable. Everyone had a momenl of 
epiphany — our 10 Favorite War 
Movies We had no basis for decid- 
ing which one we preferred, bul 
through lasie, or lack thereof, we 
mulled over several films until we 
decided which ones were our 
favorites. 

And now Ihe list remember 
no wagering, these are just for shits 
and grins: 

• The Green Berets: One of sev- 
eral films on this list that features 
lohn Wayne. The Green Berets 
became the first Vietnam War 
movie, but it was made in ihe style 
of ihe WWII movies. That is. . . 
fighting the evil "yellow" hordes. 
This movie fails to delve into tbe 
horrors of war and the Vietnam War 
in particular. But it was the first lo 
show Vietnam was a war, not a con- 
flict. 

• All Quiet on the Western Front 
(either version): About 20 years ago, 
Richard "John-Boy Wallon" 
Thomas and Ernest Borgnine 
starred in a remake of ihe 1930's 
WWI classic. Taken from Erich 
Fromme's novel of the same name, 
the original was the first war movie 
which didn't glorify killing for the 



sake of God and country. 

* Full Metal Jacket: Matthew 
Modine starred in this film which 
had ihe besi "boot camp" scenes in 
the history of movie making. The 
acior who played the Senior Drill 
Instructor actually spent 1 2 years on 
Paris Island as a Marine Corps Drill 
Instructor. Directed by Stanley 
Kubrick, "Jacket's" battle scenes 
have a surrealistic quality about 
(hem. Kubrick captures the chaos of 
war and destruction like no other 
director before or since 

• Apocalypse Now: Francis Ford 
Coppola spent bis own cash to fin- 
ish filming this master- 
piece of warped and 
twisted facets of war. Not 
enough can be said about 
this movie because this 
movie cannot be put into 
a few words. Coppola 
obviously drew heavily 
from ihe book, "Heart Of 
Darkness." 

• Henry V (either 
version): Both Sir Lawrence 
Olivier's and Kenneth Brannagh's 
adaptation of the Shakespeare clas- 
sic show the gritty side of ancient 
hand-to-hand, face-to-face combai 
Even if you dislike Shakespeare 
(gasp), the St. Crispin's Day speech 
is the besi inspirational talk given 
before a battle this side of Bobby 
Knight's half-time tirades. 

* Glory: Imagine ... an American 
war movie featuring tbe contribu- 
tion of African-Americans. Hey — it 
happened! Morgan Freeman, 
Denzel Washington and Matthew 
Broderick star in this Civil War era 
film about a segregated company of 
freed slaves or descendants of freed 
slaves wbo fought for their freedom 
and gave their lives for their broth- 
ers in chains. 

• A Midnighl Clear This film, 
which never reached ihe masses, 
showed the compassion of ihe peo- 
ple in war. War is a natural abhor- 
rent lo our nature and people within 



a war search for their own humanity 
as well as benevolence in others. 
Ethan Hawke stars 

• MASH: The movie, not the TV 
series. Director Robert Altman 
filmed this under (he guise of it 
being a Korean war epic. In reality, 
MASH was Airman's anti- Vietnam 
teslamenL This movie shows how 
desperate people are, in ihe midst of 
brutality, to save themselves with 
humor. 

• Every John Wayne WWII 
movie: They're all pretty much the 
same. John Wayne — tough leader 
John Wayne — lightens up a little. 
John Wayne — giving his life for his 
buddies in the platoon 

• Kelly's Heroes: Clint 
Eastwood. Don Rickles, Carol 
O' Conner and Donald Sutherland 
star in this humorous cable classic. 
Rickles, Eastwood and Sutherland 
race to steal $10 million of German 
gold. In the process they bust 
through Nazi lines and wind up 10 
miles behind enemy lines. 
0' Conner plays a general who 
wants to get in on the glory of kick- 
ing some Nazi butt 

Unfortunately, some movies 
failed to make the list. They are still 
fine war films bul were missing tbe 
one thing which would make them a 
true classic in our minds. 

Some of those are "Hamburger 
Hill," "Platoon." "Failsafe," 
"1941," "The Fighting 69th." "The 
Dirty Dozen," "The Walking Dead" 
"Gettysburg" and "Sergeant York." 
"Courage Under Fire" has not made 



ilself into a classic yet. bul it has the 
potential lo blow you away.

Domestic violence 
panel set for Oct. 3 



by Jeremy Ex * n barge r 
Cbkf Reporter 

One woman is battered every fif- 
teen seconds One out of six mar- 
riages has a paitem of abuse. Most 
men who baiter abuse more than 
once, IVenty -eight percent of high 
school students have experienced 
violence in a dating relationship On 
college campuses, one out of every 
five students will have direct per- 
sonal relationship with personal 
violence. 

Tbese statistics are just a few of 
tbe implications of bow domestic 
violence aflecis the students on 
campus. 

On Thursday, Oct. 3, IPFW 
Center for Women and Returning 
Adults will be offering a panel dis- 
cussion called Domestic Violence: 
A Panel of Experts 

Tbe event will take place from 
12-1:30 p.m in Walb Memorial 
Union. Room 224. 

The conference will include a 
panel discussion that will involve 
the nature, causes and prevention of 
domestic violence Professionals 
will speak of the experiences they 
have dealt with in their line of work 
and relay defensive techniques 

"Through the discussion, women 
wdl leam it (domestic violence) is a 
ius problem, all tbe people it 
affects, and what things are being 
done and can be done." said 
Christine Zielinski, coordinator of 
the center. 



The panel will include Linda 
Kusse-Wolf, of the YWCA; Lt. 
Dottie Walker, of the Fort Wayne 
Police Department; Zoe Zefo, of the 
Fort Wayne Women's Bureau; and 
Beth Murphy-Beams, from the 
Center for Non-violence. 

"Women should not be afraid to 
gel help from a bad relationship," 
said Kuss-Wolf. She hopes to ted 
women about the "red flags" and 
warning signs (hat show a relation- 
ship is going bad 

According to Kusse-Wolfe, tbe 
YWCA works with 1.200-1.300 
women a year. This number does 
not even include many of the rural 
areas of Fori Wayne. She also 
admits that summer and after 
Christmas are times when the num 
bers are the highest. 

The Center for Women and 
Reluming Adults is a center that 
offers support and assistance in 
dealing with academic difficulties, 
women's issues and information for 
activities concerning women and 
returning adults. The center is open 
daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.. or by 
appointment. The center is located 
in Walb. Room G25. 

From the discussion, the center 
hopes to teach students how to 
"break the cycle of violence " 

"Hopefully, students will realize 
that there is a resource on campus to 
be safe." said Zielinski

American soccer teams need to beat the world 




Despite placing numerous play- 
ers in the English Premier League, 
Germany's Division I and other 



European and South 
American top profes- 
sional leagues, the 
United Stales' soccer 
team seems to be for- 
ever forbidden to beat 
the world's top teams 
when playing a nation- 
al game. 

Lack of talent is 
not the problem when 
the Americans face the 
rest of soccer elite's 
bad boys in between 
world cups. They bave definitely 
risen a level in the past six years, 
gaining their first Cup birth in 40 



years in 1990. 

Four years later, the U.S. hosted 
the Cup and even made it a financial 
success, a considerable feat in this 
basketball, football and baseball- 
dominated land. Our team even 
avoided becoming the first World 
Cup host ever to be eliminated in the 
first round. Hosts receive automatic 
bids to the tournament, so our bid 
was not in jeopardy in 1994 

Still, how is it we never manage 
to drop the really big guys, if we 
should be able to play with them? In 
the past two-and-a-half years, there 
have been a few bright spots. To 
whit: 



• Just before the Cup. we finally 
gathered our best side and beat 
Mexico. 1-0, in Mexico City 

• During the first round of the Cup, 
we beat Colombia, a darkhorse for 
the World Cup title, 2-1 and played 
a significant role in eliminating 
them prematurely from the tourna- 
ment. 

• Last summer, we beat Argentina. 
3-0, during the first round of Copa 
Americana, winning our group, and 
made it to the tournament semifi- 
nals. 

But any champion's key is con- 
sistency. After the big upset of 
Colombia, we lost to a slight-of- 



band Romanian team which tended 
to cry a lot. If we could have just 
tied them, we would have won our 
holly -con tested group and not 
played Brazil in the second round. 

And after dousing Argentina a 
couple games earlier, the Americans 
fell to Uruguay, two-time World 
Cup champions, but with little to 
show after 1950. 

Until our side can pick up their 
mental play a notch to compliment 
staying with the world's best physi- 
cally, we will still be soccer's final 
frontier and we will not fare any bet- 
ter in Paris (1998) than we did on 
our own turf. 



Cross country teams go through 
mid-season evaluation 



by S. Brant Kelley 
Sports Editor 

IPFW Cross Country coacb Judy 
Tillapaugn began the running sea- 
son with the anticipation that her 
teams would improve. And improve 
they nave, but she is salt looking 
for an across-the-board lift to the 
next level; she is getting it in limit- 
ed measure from the women's 
team, but the men's team still needs 
to tighten up. 

"ll was a race of ups and 
downs." Tillapaugn said of the 
men's race "Some runners did per- 



sonal bests for the season, while 
others ..." While others are still try- 
ing to reach the next step. 

The men finished seventh out of 
eight teams at the Manchester 
Invitational, which turned out to be 
a light race. 

Steve Teuscb, steadily proving 
himself as IPFW's best male repre- 
sentative, finished twelfth, but only 
a minute behind the winner, with a 
time of 28 minutes and 4 seconds. 
Chad Clevinger and Adam Barton 
finished 23rd and 26th, respective- 
ly, both under 29 minutes 

The women's team finished sixth 



out of ten teams by working togeth- 
er and turning in a more balanced 
effort. 

'The gals ... they worked togeth- 
er almost the entire race,'' 
Tillapaugn said, emphasizing that 
"the best is yet to come." 

Kay Pulver finished fourth as Ibe 
top Mastodon runner with a time of 
20 minutes and 8 seconds Melanie 
Vamer followed in sixth place with 
a 20:16 lime. 

This Saturday, the runners take 
part in the Earlham College 
Invitational at 11 a.m.

Still, coach J Webb Horton 
remains optimistic As an under- 
occupied squad which forfeits at 
least two matches a meet, the 
Mastodons have the cards routinely 
stacked against them from the start. 

Travelling to the University of 
Southern Indiana, the 'Dons started 
a weekend full of inclement weath- 
er. With the 'Dons down five match- 
es to none, the remainder of the 



meet at US1 was canceled due to 
rain. The closest match in 
Evansvillc was ihe number two 
doubles' 9-8 loss. "That was a beart- 
breaker," Horton said. 

The nexi day. IPFW travelled to 
Bellarmine College and lost six 
matches before the meet was once- 
again called because of rain. And 
once again, the number two doubles 
dropped a close one, 8-6. 

The 'Dons had a third meet at 
Kentucky Wesleyan University 
scheduled but canceled because of 
the weather. It will be rescheduled 
at a later dale

Volleydons 
continue 
success 
streak 

by S. Brant KcDcy 
Sports Editor 

The IPFW women's volley- 
ball team continued its streak of 
dominance last week as the 
Volleydons won four matches 
to extend (heir iwo-week-long 
winning streak to seven and 
dive into the Great Lakes Valley 
Conference with a 4-0 mark. 

IPFW won twelve games in 
those last week's four matches 
and lost only two as the team 
improved to 10-4. The upper- 
classman-laden 'Dons have 
used their national-caliber mid- 
dle hitting, superior athleticism 
and tougb beg inning -season 
experience to vanquish One 
hapless foe after another in their 
meteoric rise to one of the best 
in the Midwest. 

Wayne State University was 
first in line on Wednesday The 
Tartars won the first game, 15- 
12. over a younger team coach 
Tim Heffron used before suc- 
cumbing to the Volleydons* 
experience in three straight, 15- 
9. 15-12. 15-5. 

"As the match went on," 
Heffron said, "we played more 
consistently and they made 
more mistakes ... Nol only did 
we outpower them, we out- 
played them psychologically." 

Friday afternoon would pre- 
sent GLVC rival Quincy 
University on IPFW's table. 
The Hawks barely scored 
enough points to win one game, 
let alone three as the 'Dons 
rolled lo a 15-10. 15-2, 15-5 
victory. Still, Heffron was look- 
ing for better team performance 
against an optimistically mid- 
dle-of-the-pack (2-8) volleyball 
squad 

"I think we are still strug- 
gling ... We still haven't reached 
the level of Grand Valley." he 
said, referring to the 'Dons' 
upset of llth-ranked Grand 
Valley State two weeks ago. 

On Saturday, the second day 
of IPFW's Women's Volleyball 
Weekend, ihe 'Dons cut two 
more notches in their belt. 

Conference mystery 

University of Missouri-St. 
Louis fell to the fast-starting 
'Dons 15-8. 15-12, 15-5. as the 
Riverwomen never recovered 
from the early one-two punch 
the 'Dons delivered. "They 
came out strong at the begin- 
ning," UMSL coach Denise 
Sylvester said. "We came out a 
little tentative, they got the 
momentum and ran with it." 

Heffron said his team dis- 
played more focus and less 
emotion as his team took a busi- 
ness-like approach to the 
match. "We took that match 
very seriously ... We came out 
very focused," he said. "We 
came out and really played very 
steadily" 

Oakland University closed 
out the weekend for the 
Volleydons, with the same 
result. The Pioneers were the 
seventh Great Lakes 
Intercollegiate Athletic 

Conference foe to face IPFW 
this season. The 'Dons won the 
first game, 15-2, with their ath- 
leticism. 

Then the Pioneers banded 
IPFW their first game loss in 
eleven games, 10-15. "At that 
point," Heffron said, 'They 
issued a challenge. From that 
point on, they were not a 
pushover. They really pushed 
us." 

If fire produces a diamond, 
then the pressure makes tne real 
winners shine. According to 
Heffron, senior Julie Parrot was 
the catalyst that helped ihe 
'Dons push over the lop to win 
the match. 15-13. 15-5. "Julie 
really stepped up as a senior, 
and really came through at the 
pressure point in the match," be 
said.

Soccer team builds on last week's tournament high 



hy S. Brant Kclky 
Sports Editor 

Last week, the IPFW men's soc- 
cer learn goi to see just bow much 
they matured during the Three 
Rivers Classic tournament almost 
two weeks ago. 

On Wednesday, the Mastodons 
played an opponcnl far from the 
Division I class they hosted just Tour 
days earlier and made short work of 
the Grace College Lancers ai 



Huntington, 5-1 

The 'Dons walked into the lock- 
ers with a 2-1 halfttme lead, then 
increased the pressure a notch and 
put home three more goals in the 
second half for the walkaway Justin 
Labrum and Mike Harper scored in 
the first half, and David Smith. Josh 
Sgro and Harper again scored in the 
second half to round out a balanced 
Mastodon attack. 

IPFW coach Terry Siefankicwicz 
said be thought bis 'Dons displayed 



more precision than the Lancers 
"They were physical and they were 
aggressive, but they weren't very 
technical," he said. 

Grace College's coach disagreed 
somewhat "IPFW was more 
aggressive lhan we." he said, but 
added. "We have an awful lot to 
leam about doing basic things 
right." 

On Saturday night, the 'Dons 
continued their consistent play, but 
fell to Quincy University of Illinois.

2-1 (OT), on a missed call near the 
end of the match. Striker Danny 
Perez moved into the penalty area 
and was taken down by a Hawk 
defender as time expired. According 
to Siefankiewicz. even the QU play- 
ers expected to suffer a penalty kick 
which could have ended the game in 
regulation in IPFW's favor. 

"It [the game] was a very physi- 
cal game." Siefankiewicz said. "We 
were kind of disappointed, because 
we thought we played well enough

Sunday, the Mastodons redeemed 
themselves by downing GLVC 
member University of Missouri-Si. 
Louis, 1-0, in a defensive contest 

While playing on mostly their 
own side of the field against the for- 
mer Division 1 school, the 
Mastodons did get a few prime scor- 
ing opportunities, and with 1:50 left 
in the match. Justin Labrum chipped 
the ball over UMSL's defense and 
Mike Harper beat two defenders and 



dribbled the ball past the goalkeeper 
for the match's only score. 

"They had a real strong mid- 
field." Siefankiewicz said, "and 
were able lo attack us, but our 
defenders did a good job." 

The weekend put the Mastodons' 
record at 3-4 and their GLVC mark 
at 1-1; ihis weekend they hosl the 
University of Indianapolis and Si. 
Joe University on Saturday and 
Sunday, respectively.
