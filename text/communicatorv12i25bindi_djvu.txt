S.G. candidates 
run unchallenged 



By JIM CHAPMAN 

Chief Reporter 

The Student Body Elections will be 

held next Tuesday and Wednesday, 

April 14 and 15. This year, for a while 

. anyway, it seemed as if (ho students of 

■ TPFW would have a choice of who to 

vote for. 

Current senators Ken Schenk and 

Ellen Engleman along with SUBOG 

J member Clair Venus have decided to 

run on one ticket. For a while, it ap- 

; peared that Don Guffey, with no 

running mates decided yet, would run 



against Schenk, Engleman, and Venus 
on another ticket. However, due to 
certain circumstances, he has decided 
not lo run. 

1PFW students will again have one 
choice to choose from — Ken Schenk 
for Student Body President, Ellen 
Engleman for President of the Senate, 
and Clair Venus for SUBOG Chair- 
person. 

Student Body President nominee 
Ken Schenk, when elected, will try to 
work more with student-related issues.

When elected, Schenk hopes to have 
a publicity committee formed which 
would consist of members of both 
SUBOG and the Student Senate. The 
members of both of the branches 
would work together to spread in- 
formation around IPFW about what 
issues are being discussed in Students' 
Government. Schenk wants more 
students to know what is going on in 
Students' Government. And he would 
like more petition and letter-writing 
campaigns to be formed to aid 
legislation in the Senate. 

Schenk would also like more 
students to participate in Students' 
Government. 

"I would like to see the people who 
spend time cutting down Students' 
Government to come on out and help 
us instead of complaining. I am of- 
fering a challenge to all students who 
have the time lo participate in 
Students' Government," said Schenk. 

Engleman, who will be President of 
the Senate when elected, feels that 
Schenk, Venus, and she have the ex- 
perience to lead the Students' Gov- 
ernment. 




Tornado plan untried 



Hypnosis gives help 



By ELLIE WOLLMAN 
Staff Writer 
Editor's note: This is the first article in 
a three-part series which looks at 
hypnosis, misconceptions that surround 
it, and its role as a possible aid in 
overcoming some personal difficulties. 

Dealing with smoking or weight 
problems and stress or anxiety can be 
.difficult. 

Some people may be able to find help 
to break old habits and exert their 
willpower over mental conditions 
through hypnosis. 

For many people, hypnosis allows 
them "an incredible range of ways 
that they can take control of their 
lives, or reclaim control of their lives, " 
said Marcia Benjamin-Leiter, 
Instructor of Speech Communications 
at Manchester College, North Man- 
chester. 

Besides teaching interpersonal 



stion and counseling 

students in mental health at the 
college, Benjamin-Leiter is very in- 
volved with the use of hypnosis in 
helping others. 

She believes that if someone is 
having common, everyday problems, 
or even uncommon problems, hypnosis 
is worth trying. "No one can predict 
whether or not hypnosis will be suc- 
cessful, but the more a person believes 
that it will be effective, the better the 
chances are for a more positive out- 
come, "she said. 

Many people have misconceptions 
about hypnosis, Benjamin-Leiter said, 
often leading them to be afraid of it, 
instead of realizing its true potential 
value. 

"Hypnosis is a relaxed state of mind 
that allows a person to accept 
suggestions for positive changes in 
their behavior." she said. She ex- 



plained that when a person is in this 
relaxed state, the mind is uncluttered 
— without the numerous thoughts and 
ideas that usually run through it all 
day., 

"At this point the subconscious mind 
becomes more receptive to 
suggestions than it is in the conscious 
waking state," she said. Psychological 
research has shown that when people 
are given suggestions while in this 
relaxed state of mind, the suggestions 
will often have an impact on then- 
regular behavior. 

"Hypnosis triggers change, rather 
than solving a specific problem," 
Benjamin-Leiter said. "It allows the 
person to begin the process of being 
able to control their lives, thus 
enabling a person to break the cycle of 
bad habits."

A tornado has been spotted near Industrial 
Park. The twister Is spinning a path down 
U.S. 30. In its path is IPFW. 

The National Weather Service has already 
notified I PFW's Police Chief Maurice Shady, 
informing him to take emergency action. 

" 1 approaching tornado, 
n students and 
in Timer 

The answer to that hypothetical 
question is debatable. IPFW does 
have a tornado safely procedure plan, 
but the plan has never been tested. 

"It's the best plan we have at this 
time,"said Shady 

Shady said he does not plan to 
conduct drills. "We have not tried nor 
will we try a dry run, because students 
and faculty do not want to be in- 
terrupted," he said. 

In the event of a tornado emergency, 
the plan calls for the IPFW police to 
notify "key personnel" in each 
building and inform them to im- 
plement emergency procedures In 
viieir building. 

After being notified, these key 
personnel would then run through the 
halls — like Paul Revere — sounding 



the alarm to takeshelter. 

Instructors would then lead their 
classes according to instructions 
posted on the bulletin board In each 
classroom to the building's basement. 
If all went well, they would remain 
there until notified through word-of- 
mouth by IPFW police that all was 
clear. 

Shady foresees trouble in notifying 
those in Kettler Hall and those that 
might be outside. "Kettler would be 
difficult to notify because of the way 
the building is laid out," he said. 
"Kettler is also the most heavily 
populated building." 

Shady could not guess how much 
time the current plan would take to 
implement. "We are looking into other 
methods of sounding an alarm," he 
said. Shady does believe, however, 
that the current plan would work. ' 

One alternative might be the Friends 
Carillon donated lo IPFW by the 
Friends of the University, said Lorane 
Hamblinof University Relations, 

The carilloni -a J»ll toweiv-will-bfl-- 
mounted on the northeast corner of the 
newly construcled building "D." It will 
have the capability of reproducing the 
Westminster Chimes and it will ' 



have an organ which can be played by 
the Music faculty. Hamblin said the 
carillon could be used as a tornado alert 
if the need arises. 

The Allen County Civil Defense is also 
trying lo raise money to build an early 
warning system. Currently, neither 
Fort Wayne nor Allen County has any 
type of warning system. 

The system planned to be constructed 
by Civil Defense would be comprised of 
sirens thai would be strategically 
placed ihroughout the county and city. 
The sirens would be sounded in the 
event of an emergency. 

"We need about a half a million 
dollars to build the system," said 
Jeanne Pearson, administrative 
assistant of Allen County Civil 
Defense." We have already received 
overS3,000 in donations." 

Pearson said the Civil Defense has 
been planning lo build this system for 
more than three years. 

Pearson said that people of Fort 
Wayne have been reluctant In donating 
' tb'lhe construction of this system. 

"People have too much apathy and 
don't believe a tornado will hit here. 
Xenia, Ohio thought that too, " she said. 



Fort Wayne area citizens disagree about gun control; 
£o«ps claim constitutionality of differing points of view 



By WAYNE STEFFEN 
Chief Reporter 
"Support your right to arm 
bears." 

Those who support this bit of 
tongue-in-cheek, bumper slicker 
philosophy are not always easy to 
find in Fort Wayne. 

Certainly they would only rarely 
be seen at Conroy's gun store on 
Spring Street. Entering Conroy's is 
akin to stepping in to a private club 
or favorite bar. Ralph Conroy 
presides over his carpeted, paneled 
domain in a friendly manner, nol at 
all self-conscience of the ,45 caliber 
pistol strapped lo his ample waist. 
By his own admission, business is 
good. Looking around the store, one 
can see everything from tiny 
Derringers capable of only two shots 
at very close range lo fully 
automatic commando rifles on 
display, 

Also of interest is the bulletin 
board near the door. In addition to 
the announcements of gun club 
meetings and the like, is a cartoon, 
copied from somewhere, of "King" 
Teddy Kennedy. Kennedy is an 
outspoken supporter of hand gun 
control who, Conroy said, "would 
like to take guns away from 
everyone except people like himself, 
who can afford to hire bodyguards." 
Conroy firmly believes the 
registration and licensing of hand- 
guns is the first step to the con- 
fiscation of all firearms. So does one 
of his customers, Gerald Johnson, a 
National Rifle Association in- 
structor and a gunsmith. 

"People have a right to protect 
themselves and their homps," said 
Johnson, "And 'there is really no 
difference between so-called 
sporting arms and defense arms. 
You can defend yourself with 
anylh!ng,"he added, 

Conroy nodded, "If you seek to 
control one type of gun or outlaw il, 
then people will simply buy another 
kind." 

Johnson asked, ' 'What good would 
it do? The times they have tried 
Strict gun controls il hasn't .worked. 
Look al New York, they have one of 
the highest murder rates in the 
country and some of the toughest 
gun control laws." 
"People in favor of handgun 




control always talk about 'Japan and 
England to show control can work. 
But these places are so different 
from us culturally that there is 
really no comparison," said 
Johnson. 

"We already have all the gun laws 
we need. The answer is swift and 
speedy justice in the courts," 
Conroy said, This brought 
agreement from several customers 
in the store as he continued, "If 
there are high penalties for com- 
mitting a crime with a gun, and the 
criminal knew that he would receive 
these sentences no matter whal kind 
of pica bargaining deal his lawyer 
got him, then we would see a 
a reduction of gun use in crimes. " 

"If suinuunc wanls to commit a 



crime then he will get a gun whether 
It's against the law or not. Then the 
private citizen must be able to 
protect himself, " said Johnson. 

"Many policemen admit that ihey 
cannot protect people. And that 
means it's up to us to look out for 
ourselves, "said Conroy. 

"And what about target shooters? 
Some people just like to go out and 
shoot for a sport. Many of these 
people would never think of carrying 
a gun for protection but still wish lo 
own one," Johnson said. 

As for the laws on the books, 
Conroy and Johnson have little faith 
in those whose job il is to protect 
citizens. The Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms is Ihe 
Federal office in charge »l 



regulating the sale and trans- 
portation of all guns in the United 
States. 

"The bureau is the closest thing 
that this country has to a Gestapo," 
Conroy said. "They seem to be much 
more interested in harassing dealers 
than in catching criminals. " 

Johnson, who is a dealer as well, 
explained. "The ATF does not 
receive cases from other agencies 
the way the FBI does. It must go out 
and make its own," 

"Many times this consists of 
setting honest citizens up. Say 1 
wanted to sell several guns from my 
collection, to pay a bill or something. 
I would check with ATF to see if I 



could do il legally, they might tell 
me it was all right and I would go 
ahead and do it. Then tbey would 
come down on me and arrest me for 
violating the law," he said. 

To support this cfaim, Conroy has 
several clippings on hand describing 
occurences of this nature. 

But the majority of killings in this 
country are not committed by 
someone trying to defend himself. 
Accidents and crimes of passion still 
account for more than half the 
victims of gunplay. 

"The answer lo this is education. 
There are many defense and 
proficiency courses sponsored by- 
many gun clubs and organizations," 
Johnson said. 

"If people were to learn how to use 
guns properly then accidental 
deaths would fall off lo nothing. Gun 
owners would learn how to slore 
(heir guns as well so that kids would 
not gel into Ihem and injure 
themselves." he said. 

The difference between a 
proficiency course and a defense 
course is thai in the former, basic 
handling and gun safety are taught, 
while the latter specializes in pe;- 
combal and defense 
techniques. Both types of course 
include both range and classroom 
instruction. 

"You can't learn too much about 
guns. The more you know about 
something Ihe less it frightens you," 
Johnson said. 

"As for crimes of passion, well, 
you're always going lo have those 
People say that without guns they 
would be lessened, but t don't think 
that we have all the statistics on 
murders with knives or clubs that 
we do on handguns The numbers 
might not change that much," he 
said. 

As Ihis reporter lefl Conroy's gun 
store he noticed thai in ihe middleof 
a Monday afternoon, a slow time for 
many businesses, that (here were 
slill about a dozen or so people in the 
store who seemed lo be buying and 
not just window shopping Indiana is 
one of Ihe easiest places in the nation 
to buy a handgun because of its few 
restrictions and easy licensing of 
handguns. More and more people, 



all kinds of people, are apparently 
taking advantage of this. 

Fourth District congressman Dan 
Coats ran on an anti-gun control 
platform in the last local election, 
though handguns were not a leading 
issue in that campaign. 

"It is very important to me that 
the individual states retain control 
over their gun laws," Coats said. 
"But I do not believe that those who 
favor gun control are necessarily 
trying to confiscate anyone's gun, 
They are simply trying to solve a 
serious problem in a way that I 
happen to disagree with, " 

Coats lives in Washington, D.C., 
where "we have one of the toughest 
gun control laws in the nation. I 
can't walk the two blocks from my 
office, past the Justice Department, 
back to my room afler dark. When I 
first got to Washington and tried it, I 
was mugged. In all I have been 
mugged three times since taking 
office," 

The first-time U.S. representative 
"believes, that the citizen has a right 
to defend his life. My landlord was 
once robbed in his home on a spring 
Sunday afternoon because 
somebody forgot to lock the back 
door. He remarked lo me that "l 
didn't even have lo leave Ihe com- 
fort and privacy of my own home. 

"If a criminal can have a gun, 
then a private, law abiding citizen 
should have the right lo own one as 
well. Why should we penalize the 
good people and, in effect, give an 
advantage to the law breakers?" he 
said. 

For many who are against gun 
control, gun possession is a right, 
and for others, a pleasure. 

Kathleen Squadrilo. a philosophy 
professor at IPFW, disagrees with 
this viewpoint. "So many people are 
trying to make Ihis an emotional 
issue. But it's really just common 
sense, "she said. 

"If you lower the total number ol 
guns in a population, then the 
number of deaths by guns will 
decrease.

RAISING THE ACWITV ^ 

fKS AGAIN! SS q 




Sludents' Government elections at 
1PFW reminds one of the elections held 
in Eastern European countries: 
Everyone can vole bul there's only one 
slate of candidates on the ballot. 

Again in 1981 — as in '80. '79 and '78 — 
no competition is vying for Ihe positions 
nf Siudenl Body PresidenI, Senate 
President, or SUBOG Chairperson. 

And again, there are not enough 
candidates running in the election to fill 
the 18 Senate seats nor the 14 SUBOG 
positions. 

Thai's nol to say that those running for 
those positions are not qualified — they 
are Ken Schenk and Ellen Engleman 
have served well in Students' Govern- 
menI this past year; Clair Venus has a 
college degree in business. 

Schenk seems lo have a lot of good 
ideas to put into action once elected, as 
well as the leadership quali ties- needed to 
accomplish much with Students' 
Government. 

These glowing qualifications of the 
candidates, however, do not diminish the 
importance attached to the fact that the 
student body has no choice of candidates 
in Ihe election. 

One must ask, "Why?" 

One reason might be the lack of in- 
terest among members of the student 
body in Students' Government's activi- 
ties and affairs. Many fail to realize the 



important roles played by members of 
the Student Senate and SUBOG. 

Senate members decide lo what 
groups and projects collected activity 
fees are allocated. (Of course, their 
decisions are then approved by John 
Ulmer, dean of student services and 
others.) Ihe amount of money expected 
to be allocated for next year should 
exceed $110,000. 

SUBOG members decide what ac- 
tivities will be provided for students 
each year — such as dances and the 
weekly movies. 

Another reason there are not more 
candidates is thai some facts were 
omitted from the ads aimed at potential 
candidates — such as the deadline for 
filing one's candidacy. 

While we hesitate to criticize the 
Students' Government elections lest we 
be criticized for portraying a negative 
image of Students' Government, we feel 
justified in doing so. 

While the elections in Eastern Europe 
are controlled by the governments of 
those countries, the elections here are 
open and democratic. 
Or at least they should be. 
The IPFW Students' Government 
election isn't an election. It's an ap- 
proval of the candidates running for 
office.

AN EDITORIAL 

By JOHN GLASSCOCK 

Staff Writer 

"A well-reflUl»1«J Militia, Ming 



v State. ttM right o&lt; the people 
la keep and bear Arms, shall not 
be infringed." Amendment II. 
U.S. Conaltiftton. 

One must bear in mind the 
historical perspective when 
reading this amendment. It 
barkens to a time when the 
general citizenry provided 
nity security through 



their volunteer Militia. Note 
also the punctuation and 
capitalization. The emphasis 
Is on the right of the Militia 
(now the National Guard) to 
bear arms It would be a 
misreading of history' and 
the Constitution to construe 
this right to all people, sane 
or insane. 

So much for the con- 
stitutional question. 

Now we must address and 
rectify a very devastating 
practical problem. Too 



many people are being 
killed. In all US. cities of 
over one million inhabitants, 

more than 5O0 homicides are 
committed with the use of a 
gun. In all U.S. cities, more 
than 50 percent of the 
homicides are inflicted with 
guns. This in itself is 
alarming. 

There are some very good 
examples set by our neigh- 
bor to the north, Canada, and 
by Great Britain and the

possession of handgur 
Toronto, for instance, which 
has a population of 2.5 
million people, there were 
only 4B murders in 1979. 
Twelve of those murders 
were committed with guns. 
These statistics are 
proportionate throughout 
those countries which have 
enacled similar legislation. 

Some like lo advance the 
argument that the frontier 
history of the U.S. gives us 
the right to possess guns. Sad 
to say, there is no more 
frontier in the U.S. It is time 
that we, as a nation, quit 
playing cowboy and quit 
idealising that romantic and 
inaccurate notion. It has 
always been a myth. 

There are those, columnist 
George Will for example, 
who would balance the '"gun 
righls" against civil rights 
by more closely monitoring 
the activities of the people If 
we allow the possession of 
guns to continue, this will 
inevitable. It is also the most 
striking threat to individual 
civil liberties since the 
Burger Court or the 
McCarthy era.

The gun, in theory, 
challenges all other rights 
held by the people, 
especially Life. Liberty, and 
Ihe Pursuit of Happiness. 
The gun in action is a real 
and irreversible threat. It is 
designed to threaten and lo 
kill. These concepts 
abominate the Constitutional 
process and subject the 
people to a perilous 
existence. 

1 would think that we are 
all tired of losing some of our 
greatest leaders and friends 
to Ihe terrorism inflicted by 
madmen. I would think that 
the sickening subversion of 
the Constitutional process 
would unite us with a sense 
of purpose. I would think that 
our compassion for our 



fellow human beings would 
compel us to seek the most 
effective remedy to Ihe 
terrible malady of wholesale 
murder. I would think that 
we as a nabon would grow 
up and protect the rights of 
the people, to enjoy the 
virtues of modern 

civilization. A corpse knows 
no joy. 

Whether or not this 
country goes the full 
measure to ban all guns, Ihe 
least that should be done is a 
ban on (he possession of 
handguns. We should look to 
our Canadian and British 
cousins because they have 
programs that work. We 
must remember that we do 
not have equality under the 
shroud of fear. 



The following is an ex- 
pansion of my remarks at a 
seminar on Burnout which 
was sponsored by the 
Women's Studies Program 
last fall. It is printed here by- 
popular demand. (Well, a 
couple of people asked.) 

Burnout is familiar to all of 
us. Everyone experiences it 
from time lo lime. We all 
ponder how to cope with it. 
"There is a commonality in 
Burnout; but there are also 
differences in the way we 
experience it and especially, 
in the images we have of our 
experience. Here are some 
of my Burnout images: 

To experience Burnout 
symbolically, hold a lit 
match until it completely 
burns out. It is almost im- 
possible to keep from 
dropping it as the heat 
approaches your fingers. It 
is a very apt illustration ol 
Burnout, for as Burnout 
approaches, we must drop 
things or get hurt. 

Or consider a burnt-out 
rocket which spends so much 
energy that it destroys itself 
till not even a spark is left. 

How about Burnout caused 
by The Little Red Hen 
Syndrome? You will recall 
that The Little Red Hen is 
the main character in a 
children's story who always 
said "I Will" when others 
refused a job. And so, of 
course, others refused the 
job. Always saying "I Will" 
while others sit by and say 



"Not I" leads inevitably to 
Burnout. 

You could even be left like 
Chicken Little believing the 
sky is falling. And if you feel 
that the sky is falling, it is! ! ! 
The whole blasted sky just 
dumps and dumps onyoul 

Ironically, Burnout comes 
from putting out fires. 
dealing with crises, whether 
real or imagined. And it 
comes from starting 
fires— beginning more 
projects than one can tend. It 
comes, too, from leaving 
fires untended: that; clut- 
tered desk, unanswered 
mail, unreturned phone 
calls, unpaid bills— things 
put away till later and 
somehow never done. Think 
of each of these as a tiny live 
spark. When left neglected 
and unavoidably kindled by 
the twigs of toil faced each 
day, ZAP! a towering in- 
ferno follows. And yes, you 
have Burnout. How many hot 
sparks do you have untended 
in your life? 

Consider your images of 
Burnout; they may reveal a 
great deal about its sources 
in your life. These images 
should stress (and I use the 
word advisedly) the. im- 
portance of knowing what 
Tires to put out and which to 
leave burning because they 
add a warm glow to your 
heart and life without 
threatening to destroy you.

Two speak out on elections 



To the Editor: 

5110,000. For either of us at 
a minimum wage of $3.35 an 
hour we'd have to look 
forward to 17 years of work 
lo earn this much, not ac- 
counting for inflation or 
taxes Yet this Spring 18 of 
our fellow students will 
decide how this amount of 
money will be spent next 
year to improve the quality 
or campus life. This is one of 
the reasons why it is im- 
portant to carefully choose 
which of our classmates 
becomes a Students' 
Government member. 

On its face, Students' 
Government's complexion is 
seen as "not doing 
anything," "Unproductive," 
and "a useless em- 
barassment." The Com- 
municator has decried in 
past months Students' 
Government as "playing 
games," "wasting time on 
the constitution," and 
"letting Ann Momper, Steve 
Westrick, and Kathy Ertel 
do alt the work." Any 
senator will tell you that 
these comments are mostly 
inaccurate but occur every 
year as cub reporters beat a 
path from the Com- 
municator office to the 
Students' Government's 



door in search of a story 
about waste and abuse. 
Hopefully Jim Chapman has 
helped reverse this image 
somewhat as he has 
presented a more equitable 
picture of Students' 
Government's real actions. 

The Communicator's 
image of infighting may be 
true although overstated. As 
noted in our experience in 
the Senate, the same per- 
sonality types reappear in 
each new senate. Admit- 
tedly, there always are one 
or two who oppose 
everything from approval of 
the minutes to passage of 
resolutions against fee in- 
creases. No matter how 
clearly needed a measure is, 
these few always contest it 
There is fighting by these 
few, but not nearly as much 
as is implied. 

Under this negative image 
Students' Government 
members work. In addition, 
however, many people fail to 
realize that SUBOG 
governors and senators are 
still people with only 24 hours 
in a day Pitting EZOi. a Bio 
Lab, four hours of work at 
Myers and McCarthy, and 
two hours at the petition 
booth all into that day Isn't 
easy, but is done by 



Students' Government 
members regularly. For- 
tunately, some of our 
classmates realize what 
Students' Government can 
achieve and, despite these 
limitations, try to realize it. 

Unfortunately, many 
students don't recognize this 
and think Students' 
Government can conduct 
surveys, such as the one 
which lead to shuttle 
to Concordia last Fall. The 
Students' Government can 
organize petition drives, 
such as the one opposing a 
fee increase this March. The 
Students' Government can 
lobby for students' interests, 
such as was done in joining 
the Statewide lobbying 
Steering Committee this 
February. 

Students' Government is 
not by design an un- 
productive farce, despite its 
image as such. For those 
who don't know, a farce is a 
light-hearted comedy. 
Whether it is a farce, 
however, depends on the 
quality of the players. On 
April 14 and 15, we have the 
opportunity to decide what 
our Students' Government 
will be. Bob Griebel, 

Jeff Sandy, and 

Present and Past Senators

Slaff Writer

at was aboul the 
manner in which "The 
sus Savage," which 
opened March 27 at the Are- 
Dinner Theatre, was 
received. Received it was, 
and should have been, by the 
delighted audience who 
attended the opening per- 
formance. 

The play, written by John 
Patrick, concerns Ethel P. 
Savage, who is deemed 

ientally deficient by her 
three siep-children. The 
for her being so 
deemed is that she decides lo 
put her money to what she 
considers a good use — she 
established the Ethel P. 

! Savage Memorial Fund to 
help | the needy Her children, 
Tinding themselves "needy," 



lock her away at The 
Cloislers in an effort to 
secure their mother's ten 
million dollar fund. 

This curious Savage en- 
counters, in The Cloisters, 
five patients with whom she 
comes to find a richer side of 
life From here, the question 
does noi become "will she 
lose her money," but rather 
"in a society that values 
money and will go to any 
lengths to acquire it, who is 
sane?" 

In The Goislers, where 
money holds no value, where 
happiness is sought at all 
costs — if it means stealing 
radio tubes and hiding 
newspapers, where dreams 
are dreamt near to the point 
of reality, where rugs are 
trod al their perimeters in 
order to wear them out 
evenly and make them last 
longer, who is insane? 
Certainly not Mrs. Savage. 



This nice societal com- 
ment is highlighted by the 
offbeat characters and their 
comical ways of dealing with 
their world, from the 
scurrying, fragile Fairy May 
lo the determined, angry 
Mrs Paddy to the arrogant, 
gullible step-children, Titus, 
Samuel and Lily Belle. 

Notable performers of the 
night were Nancy Settel- 
meyer as Mrs. Savage, 
Larry Wardlaw as her son. 
Titus. Elaine Nickell as Mrs. 
Paddy, and Pal Anderson as 
Fairy May. Each was 
charming, delightful and 
very funny and at the same 
time very believable. 

The production was well- 
paced and nicely directed by 
Dave Barngrover. who ef- 
fectively utilized the stage to 
create a fluidity of 
movement. "The Curious 
Savage" was a thoroughly 
enjoyable show, and it runs 
through April II.

HOLODICK 

Staff Writer 
McGuffy Lane, a band who 
will be appearing on the 
Walb Memorial Union patio 
April 15, has recently 
released a debut album 
entitled "McGuffy Lane." 
The album offers a sound 
from a band that is a mixture 
of country, bluegrass, rock, 
and folk music. 

The album itself is in- 
novative and unique in 
nature. It has a lot of good 
moments and a lot of bad, 
but this being their first 
album it is. impressively 
done. Most of the songs 
consist of down south 
country, tinged with some 
steel guitar work, and rock 
and roll coating that makes 
it super 

The album starts off with a 
tune called "People Like 



You," a rather mediocre 
song. The next cut, "Long 
Time Lovin' You," might be 
the best song on this side. It's 
a slow moving counlry 
ballad. 

The last two songs on side 
one are rather special. The 
first of these, "Let Me Take 
You To The Rodeo." has a 
flavor of blues throughout 
the whole song. This, mixed 
with the country sound, 
makes it a great song The 
harmonica is worked with 
masterfully. The next cut is 
called "Green Country 
Mountains," and it has 
received a lot of air-play on 
the radio. This particular 
track probably has the more 
southern rock sound — It 
sounds a lot like what The 
Ozark Mountain Daredevils 
might do. 

Side two has a couple great 
moments to it also. One of 



these is the song "Stage 
Coach." "Stage Coach," has 
a great beginning and an 
exceptionally nice melody. 
The harmonics, all around, 
fit in quite well. It was a very 
good choice to start the side 
out with. 

The other great moment is 
"Lady Autumn" — another 
ballad. This song is sweet 
and tender; a quiet unusual 
country love ballad/ The 
vocals (as with all of the 
songs on the album) are 
enticing and blend in well 
with the instrumental. 

McGuffy Lane should be a 
treat for the students when 
they appear at IPFW during 
Harbor Arbor. Their album 
is definitely worth pur- 
chasing for anyone who is 
into country or southern rock 
music The album is tasteful 
and offers a lot of variety. 



Harbor Arbor Days to enliven campus next week 



McGuffy Lane will be featured 
in annual spring fest at IPFW 



Bv TIM SMITH 

Staff Writer 

It's that time of year 

. again. Harbor Arbor days 

begins on April 13, shorlly 

- after spring break. The 
festival seems lo be IPFW's 

' answer to the Little 500, and 
it's a worthy substitution at 
, that. 

Since no one seems lo 

- remember exactly how the 
'■ festival got it's name, here's 

a little insight on the origin of 
the Harbor Arbor title. "It's 
just been around.'' said 
Kathy Ertel. one of the 
coordinators of the week- 
long affair "It has 
something to do wilh the fact 
lhal it's held dround Arbor 
. day and was originally done 

down by the river " 
; Nobody could., remember 
| what Arbor day Is al) about 
}■ either. The World Book 



encyclopedia says this about 
Arbor day; "Arbor day is a 
day sel apart for the planting 
of trees. It is observed 
especially by school 
children. The first Arbor day 
was celebrated in Nebraska 
on April 10, 1872. By that 
time, settlers had cut down 
most of the trees in 
Nabraska The idea (or 
Arbor day was the brainchild 
of J. Sterling Morton, a 
newspaper publisher of 
Nebraska City People soon 
began celebrating it all over 
the country." 

Technically, the Harbor 
part of the name is obvious. 
The poinl at which the St Joe 
river passes by fPFW is just 
north of the dam. In this area 
the river bkeks up and 
widens forming a harbor of 
sorts. So there it is. Harbor 
Arbor 



The highlight of the week, 
as it has been in past years, 
will be the outdoor concert 
held on the patio of the 
Walb Memorial Union on 
Wednesday, April 15. This 
year's band is McGuffey 
Lane, a regional country 
rock band who is about to go 
national. 

The concerts have gotten 
smaller in the past five 
years The reason for this 
reduclion in size, said 
student senator Mark Wells, 
is because of the problems 
encountered with large 
crowds, particularly with the 
"heads" "You could have 
made a fortune recycling the 
beer cans that were left 
laying around," he said. 



Monday, April 13, enter- 
tainment will be supplied by 
Sieve Gibson, a Georgia 
comedian and cartoonist 



Tuesday, SUBOG will host 
a picnic on the Union patio, 
with food provided free lo 
activity card holders. 

Wednesday will feature 
the McGuffey Lane concert, 
the Purdue Aero Club Sky 
Jump (they hope lo land in 
the area around the Union) 
and the Sigma Phi Epsilon' 
Tug 0' War. Anyone may get 
a learn together and enter 
the pull. 

Thursday offers the 
University Friends of 
Animals Pet Show. Theshow 
will feature unique animals 



performing equally unique 
stunts. 

On Friday, SUBOG will 
sponsor the Harbor Arbor 
dance at Shilo Reception 
Hall. The local band Sunrise 
will play and there will be a 
cash bar. 

For the wrap up. a Penny 
Carnival will be held 
Saturday for the children of 
studenls and faculty 
members, featuring such 
kiddie activities as a duck 
pond, Easter egg hunt and 
pin the (ail on the donkey 
That njghl there will be a 
jazz concert and workshop 
given by Rythmic Union. 

Be ready for Harbor Arbor 
days. They will be here soon.

Broadway shows. (Photo by Martha Swope.) 



'Dancin 



ByMIKECEFFEN 
' ( Chief Reporter 

Bob Fosse's genius was 

apparent on Mar 26 when his 

revue, "Dancin'," came to 

lown at the Embassy to thrill 

. a sell-out crowd. 

Fosse is the only man to 

win an Oscar, Emmy and 

Tony in the same year, and 

"Dancin"' provides us with 

■ ample reason why. 

One of the reasons Fosse's 
choreography is so exciting 
is the sheer audacity of it. 
"Dancin"' is filled with so 
many exhilarating and 
opulent numbers that you 
can't conceive how Fosse is 
able to top himself, yet, 
amazingly, he does. It's this 
shock of constant surprise 
that thrills you when you see 
a dance of Fosse's, and it's 
also the same reaction that is 
common when you see one of 
his films. 

Two good examples of 
Fosse's audacity are the 
numbers "Percussion" and 
"Fourteen Feet." These 
numbers show Fosse's 
unique ability to make 
something work that seems 
impossible, and succeed 
Only Fosse could have 
conceived "Fourteen Feet," 
a dance number with no foot 
movement at all — the 
dancer's shoes are nailed to 
the floor. What results is a 
kinetic display of body 



99 • •-• 9 

is excitin 



movement that includes 
bumps and grinds, twistings 
and turnings with a dazzling 
swirling of lights. 

"Percussion" shows off 
Fosse's ability to build a 
dance number out of any 
type of musical score. 
"Percussion" is just what 
the title suggests, a series of 
dances with percussion 
instruments as ac- 
companiment. This number 
also shows off the hip- 
gyrating, shoulder-twisting 
movements that Fosse has 
made famous, and which 
typify his style of 
choreography. 

"Dancin"' is not only a 
tribute to Fosse's in- 
comparable genius, but also 
a tribute to dance in 
America, and to those people 
who came before him and 
helped make choreography 
an art. 

The affection Fosse feels 
for his predecessors is 
prevalent in two numbers, 
"Mr. Bojangles" and 
"Dancin' Man." "Mr. 
Bojangles" was the show's 
most poignant number and 
proved Fosse's ability for 
coming up with unique ideas. 
Rather than doing 
"Bojangles" the way you've 
seen it a hundred times 
before — an old man in 
tattered tails who can still 
dance — Fosse has two men

come out, one is dressed like 
an old bum and the other 
represents his alter ego who 
dances around him. 

"Dancin' Man" is Fosse's 
tribute to the vaudeville song 
and dance men. It is a 
stunning number, with the 
entire ensemble dressed in 
white. This number 
showcases every style of 
dance the vaudevillian would 
use. 

Fosse revolutionized 
choreography by breaking 
the standard big Broadway 
musical school of dance. 
This school is characterized 
by big production numbers 
with dozens of people m 
them. Fosse disregarded this 
standard form and look 
elements of jazz, ballet and 
athletics, stylized poses and 
combined them for his 
distinctly different brand of 

These elements create a 
fluidity of movement that is 
part of the energy charac- 
teristic of Fosse's 
choreography. This fluid 
motion is best represented in 
the show in a salute to Benny 
Goodman. In this number, 
the stage crackles with life, 
dancers go from one style of 
dance to another in the blink 
of an eye, and the number is 
filled with striking 
originality.

'Star' on TV 



BvMAYS.EllRESMAN 

Stiff Writer 
IPFW students will have fl 
chance to appear in a TV 
series this fall. Personalities 
I wishing to star in (his series 
should possess certain skills 
An ability to articulate 
: concise views, to ask 
penetrating questions and to 
be able to discuss issues 
,.. in I ell i gently in front of a TV 
camera could make one star 
, material in this series Also, 
the student must be present 
:. for each shooting and be 
i willing to complete 
prepalorv work in advance- 
All students are eligible 
i and encouraged to apply for 
one of the 20 positions. 
Judgements on ability to 
perform will be eased on an 
i interview with Clark Butler, 
Chairmen of the Philosophy 
Department. 

In an effort to reach a new 
market, Butler will teach 
this new show— an 
Introduction to Philosophy 
class being aired this fall on 
cable's channel 10, the public 
access channel 

Butler conceived the Idea 
of TV education a fpw years 
ago but was unable to im- 
plement it until channel 10 
was made available to 
higher education. 
The TV class will be one of 



the two Introduction to 
Philosophy courses Butler 
teaches Since all the 
broadcasting equipment Is in 
the basement of Helmke 
Library, the studio class will 
be held there. Tim Singleton, 
who is in charge of the TV 
department, will produce 
and provide technical in- 
formation He along with 
Butler will be responsible for 
implementation of the 
program. 

The course may by be 
taken by the home TV- 
viewing audience for college 
credit. The format ol the 
classes will be lecture and 
discussion. All assignments 
will be made on the air to 
both home and studio class 
students. The assignments 
would "largely be home 
written essay." Butlersaid. 

TV viewing students would 
be welcome to come on 
campus, Butler said, "but it 
is possible for a student to 
jlftver come jn campus and 
complete Hie course using 
themailandlhetelephone " 

After taping each class 
session, he plans to air the 
tapes at different times for 
TV viewing convenience. 

The majority of the TV 
audience will probably not 
be students, but people who 
tune in accidently and get 




Winning by losing 



interested or others who just 
want to see what it's like, 
Butler said He feels a 
pressing responsibility to 
portray each class as in- 
terestingly as possible and 
yet still maintain the 
academic content in an ef- 
fort to lure these viewers to 
school "I hope not to serve 
old students in a new way but 
to reach a new 
market— students who have 
ncyer been to school," he 
said. 

Butler said the fall 
showing would be ex- 
perimental and "if suc- 
cessful other courses would 
be offered." There are, 
however, limits to the TV 
class showing since some 
subjects would not be 



suitable for this type of 
program Courses in math, 

chemistry and physics could 
not be adapted to this format 
as easily as courses in 
psychology and sociology, he 
said. 

To register for the studio 
portion of the course 
students must get Butler's 
permission during this fall's 
registration period. Anyone 
may enroll in the TV section. 
Enrollment would be limited 
to what Butler feels he could 
handle as teacher. He has 
implied a limit of sorts by 
ordering only 50 textbooks 
(20 for studio students and 30 
for TV viewers!, but, "if 
there are more students we 
could make adjustments," 
he said.

Professor studies fiber's role in diet

Jon A Story, a professor of 
Nutritional Physiology with 
the Purdue School of Con- 
sumer and Family Sciences 
in West Lafayette, has been 
researching dietary fiber 
and its relation to heart 
disease and. cancer of the 
colon. Story was at IPFW on 
March 24 to discuss research 
done primarily in the 
laboratory with rats and 
rabbits to determine the 
, interaction of Tiber and bile 
fj* acids 

' . Fiber, commonly defined 
as indigestible bulk in the 
diet, has been found to lower 
the serum cholesterol level,

every human heart, he said. 
Tflt-serum cholesterol level 
is widely used to study heart 
disease "because it is an 
easy thing to measure," he 
said. 

In contrast lo the 
correlation between higher 
cholesterol levels and hear I 
disease, people with low 
cholesterol levels have been 
found to have a higher in- 
cidence of cancer of the 
colon. 

Wheat bran or miller's 
bran, sold in many health 
(ood stores, may help 
prevent colon cancer. Story 
said, by regulating and 
improving the bio-acid 
metabolism, but it has no 
effect on cholesterol levels. 

"There is a wide dif- 
ference in types of fiber and 
their benefits," Story said. 



Hypnosis 



I Continued from Page I ) 

Many people are unaware 
of the powers they possess to 
help themselves, par- 
ticularly the powers of their 
minds, she said. "Hypnosis 
puts the power of your mind 
to work for you and not 
against you. It directs your 
energy in a positive direc- 
tion, "she said. 

A common myth about 
hypnosis is that one's 
behavior can be controlled 
by the hypnotist- "I'm not in 
control of them ... they are in 
control of themselves," said 
the instructor "Only they 
&lt; those being hypnotized) 
have the power to change 
themselves, but I help them 
to gain that power." Ben- 
jam in- Letter did point out 
that if someone is interested 
in gaining help through 
hypnosis, it should only be 
done with a qualified, 
reputable hypnotist with 
reliable references 

A person's imagination 
can play an important role In 
the effectiveness of hyp- 
nosis. Benjamin- Letter said. 
A sense of creativity, the 
ability to visualize, or even 
just being able to vividly 
daydream can help with the 
success of hypnosis 

"Hypnosis allows you to 
imagine," she said "The 
more you imagine or 
- visualize that something is 
actually happening to you, 
the more you will be pulled 
* towards your goal of the 
desired behavior " 



With the college in- 
structor's clients, the 
desired change is usually to 
lose weight, stop smoking, 
relieve stress and anxiety 
through relaxation, and 
other common problems that 
everyone faces In life. 

The next article In this 
series will focus on how a 
Person Is hypnotized and the 
feelings he or she may ex- 
perience. Examples ol 
specific problems. Including 
what suggestions are given 
to the person while under 
hypnosis, will be featured. 



''There does seem to be a 
relationship between heart 
disease and cancer of the 
colon in relation to bile acids, 
but there are variables." 

Story noted "that fiber is a 
controversial issue in 
nutrition." Referring to 
books published by doctors 
on the subject of fiber, he 
said, "It's an over- 
simplification of the concept 
that dietary fiber is good for 
us and that all dietary fiber 
behave in the same way." 

"This is not a popular 
answer with the general 
public, who mostly get their 
education from the £1.25 
'novels' sold in drugstores 
purporting to be scientific 
' fact," he said. '», '. , 
" "■ Story said Dr.- Reuben, ' 
author of the "'SavtWour 
Life Diet" and enthusiastic 
advocate of Miller's bran, 
"didn't really know what he 
was talkingabout." 

Research and results, 
Story admits, have been 
inconclusive in the area of 
fiber in the diet and disease. 
Correlations between diet 
and heart disease seem to be 
easier to draw, hesaid. 

"Heart disease is really a 
lifestyle," he said. "Obesity, 
hypertension and cigarette 
smoking all help produce 
higher rates of heart 
disease," 

"Stress," he said, "is 
over all of them." The high 
rate ol heart disease in the 
United States can be directly 
compared to rates in 
countries like Japan and 
India. Once a country starts 
adopting a more westernized 
lifestyle, the rate goes up, he 
said. 

Exercise has not been 
proven to affect the 
cholesterol level in humans. 



but anyone who exercises 
generally aims to improve 
the cardio-pulmonary 
function, he said. Losing 
weight, sometimes a benefit 
of exercise, almost always 
lowers the serum cholesterol 
level. 

Pressed to make dietary 
recommendations, Story 
said soluble carbohydrates 
found especially in fruits like 
apples and apple peels, and 
vegetables like potatoes with 
the skins — high source- of 
protein, and beans 
(legumes) — do help lower 
the serum cholesterol level. 
Legumes are cheap, and are 
a good replacement for meat 
for vegetarians. Fat, in meat 
and fowl, is an unimportant 
factor, according lo Story, 
because it only accounts for 
three percent of the total fat 
intake in a normal diet. 

"Eggs," Story.said, "have 
gotten a bad name without a 
good cause. For most of us, 
our serum cholesterol levels 
are normals so eating 
cholesterol (high in eggs) is 
not the same thing " The 
average amount of 
cholesterol in a daily diet is 
600-700 milligrams. One egg 
is around 250 milligrams, he 
said. 

"The egg is high in 
lecithin, known to lower 
serum cholesterol," Story 
said, "so eating eggs 
probably won't affect most 
people." 

Carrots are a good source 
of fiber, and in addition, help 
lower the cholesterol levels 
and increase bile excretions, 
he said. 

"There is nothing that 
doesn't count in your diet," 
he said. "And everyone 
should throw away the sail 
shaker."

Obese people are happier 
and more self-confident after 
they lose weight, said Joanne 
l'ii'.- doctor of psychology 
at IPFW. Lantz is currently 
studying the causes of 
obesity and the 

psychological consequences 
of massive weight loss. 
Through her studies she has 
discovered three major 
reasons (or obesity. 

One of the reasons is 
simply heredity. 

"Throughout history people 
survived because they were 
good fat storers," Lantz 
explained. "The people who 
were able to store fat sur- 
vived the famines and the 
survivers then passed their 
storing ability on to their 
descendants." 

Another reason for 
obesity, Lantz believes is 
that food is used as a reward 
with children. "Children are 
told if they clean up their 
rooms they can have ice 
cream or cookies," she said, 
"and this carries over into 
adulthood. Some adults still 
think of food as a reward for 
good behavior." 

The third reason for 
weight problems in America 
is that food is plentiful and 
relatively cheap. "Obesity is 
a problem in developed 
countries," Lantz said, 
"simply because the food is 
available. In un- 

derdeveloped countries the 
food is hard to get and the 
inhabitants are much less 
likely to be overweight. " 

Although obese people are 
happier after they lose 
weight, they are also more 
likely to gel a divorce, said 
Lantz. She explained this is 
because they have gained 
self-confidence and have 
found the courage to face the 
world alone. They are no 
longer willing to put up with 
abuse from their spouses. 

"We have found that 
people who lose massive 
amounts of weight have

psychological tests," Lantz 
said, "but they still have a 
bad physical concepl. They 
are not satisfied with their 
appearance and strive to 
lose more weight." 

The subjects of Lantz's 
study were ail 100 to soo 
pounds overweight. They 
were divided into two 
groups. One group dieted for 
a year and the other had 
small-bowel bypass surgery. 
The smalt-bowel bypass is a 
surgical procedure short- 
circuiting the small intestine 
so thai the food passes 
through the body quicker 
and less calories are ab- 
sorbed. 

Lantz found that Ihe people 
in both groups lost weight 
bul those who dieted tended 
to gain weight after they 
went off the diet. Those who 
had the bypass lost weight up 
to a point, and then they 
tended to stabilize, neither 
gaining nor losing any more 
weight. However, she also 
found that people who 
resorted to the bypass 
method of weight loss often 
suffered physical side ef- 
fects. 

"All Ihe people we studied 
were women," Lantz said, 
citing the statistic that five 
times more women are obese 
than men. She attributed this 
to the fact that women tend 
to put on weight easier and 
faster than men. 

Lantz also thought that 
American women do not get 
enough exercise. "In the 
past women worked as hard 
as men," she said, "but with 
all the advanced technology 
loday most women aren't 
physically active. I certainly 
don't want to go back to 
working in (he fields, but I do 
think that women should 
exercise more than they do. " 

Lantz stressed repealedly 
(hat the research she was 
engaged in was not to find a 
better or easier way to lose 
weight, it was only to study 
the effects of weight loss. 
"There is no easy way to lose 
weight," she said. "It'shard 
and it lakes a long time." 

J-school 
OK'd by 
Trustees 

In an effort to expand and 
coordinate journalism 
education, the Trustees of 
Indiana University approved 
the development of a system- 
wide School of Journalism at 
IU. IU Bloomington Vice 
President Kenneth Gros 
Louis will be given 
responsibility for the school. 
Details of the expansion are 
yet to be worked out 

Currently, degrees in 
journalism are offered only 
at IU Bloomington and IU 
Southeast at New Albany. A 
third degreeprogram is to be 
offered al IU Indianapolis 
under the expansion, but 
only two-year transfer 
programs will be made 
available at other regional 
campuses. 

For schools like IPFW, the 
transfer programs would 
emphasize liberal arts 
education and feed into 
Bloomington.

Tilt' problem of sexual 
harassment on college 
campuses is now racing 
many universities, including 
IPFW. 

A few larger universities 
have set down an official 
policy, but most are in the 
process of enacting a written 
code and guidelines for 
students, professors, ad- 
ministrators and employees 
to follow, Jeanette Clausen, 
coordinator of Women's 
Studies, (old the SOC- 
ANTHRO Forum March 3. 

Described as a "hidden 
issue," she told the forum 
that "some people tend not to 
believe sexual harassment 
on college campuses exists, 
because it's not reported." 

Clausen, Donna Middleton, 
an assistant director and 
affirmative action officer, 

- and Linda Fox, an instructor 

- of women's studies, voiced 
opinions that students at 
IPFW would be more in- 
clined to speak up on sexual 

.'harassment once they knew 
something could be done 

aboutil. 

According to John P. 



t Sexual harassment problems exist at IPFW 



Ulmer, dean of Student 
Services, there have been 
two complaints of sexual 
harassment at IPFW in the 
past two years. , 

A female student com- 
plained about a male 
professor, and last semester, 
a male student found 
problems with a female 
professor. Each case, Ulmer 
said, was handled through 
informal discussions. 

"While I wouldn't say it 
doesn't exist," he said, 
"from my experience with 
students, I wouldn't say it is 
terribly widespread." 

What Clausen, Fox and 
Middleton presented were 
not actual cases of sexual 
harassment at IPFW but 
guidelines set up by other 
universities to deal with the 
problem. These guidelines 
are important to everyone on 
this regional campus 
because they will help shape 
and influence the policies of 
IPFW. 

The biggest problem 
facing universities, Clausen 
said, is defining sexual 
^harassment and setting up 
systems of appropriate 
government. Some of the 



unresolved questions are: 
Should there be a committee 
or an individual hearing? 
What kinds of people should 
be appointed to such com- 
mittees? if there are formal 
proceedings, can con- 
fidentiality bo kept for both 
the victim and the accused? 
What place does "consent" 
have in mutual sexual ac- 
tivity? 

Schools which have 
adopted an official policy 
seek to solve most cases of 
sexual harassment through 
informal proceedings. 
Clausen, Fox and Middleton 
stressed education as the 
most effective method of 
preventing and slopping 
harassment from occurring 
or recurring. 

In April, 1980, sexual 
harassment became a 
violation of Title VII of the 
Civil Rights Act o[ 1964. 
Although long recognized by 
the EEOC (Equal 

Employment Opportunity 
Council) as "being 
widespread," Middleton 
said, the lawmakers wailed 
16 years to make it part of 
the Constitution. Title IX of 
the same act addresses "sex 



discrimination, but not 
necessarily harassment, in 
education programs," she 
added. 

In the field of education, 
people with power 
professors, administrators, 
teaching assistants and 
employers, have the same 
power as employers in the 
workplace, Clausen said. A 
threat issued by someone 
who has this power can mean 
the withholding of a grade, 
an evaluation and even 
advancement. 

The National Advisory 
Council on Women's 
Educational Programs in 
Washington, D.C. has gone 
several steps further, Fox 
said, and defined sexual 
harassment in two 
categories: gender 
harassment which is 
basically public remarks 
made in regard to supposed 
deficiencies In a certain sex, 
and sexual. 

Sexual harassment is 
divided into four classes: 
inappropriate and offensive 
but essentially sanction-free 
sexual advances; 

solicitation of sexual ac- 
tivity; coercion of sexual 



activity; and, sexual crimes 
and misdemeanors. 

Fox cited an example of 
each kind of harassment and 
emphasized that the effects 
"go beyond a grade and a 
course." 

Alan Sandstrom, assistant 
professor of anthropology at 
IPFW, expressed concern 
for professors who might be 
victims of a "phony rap." 

"What do professors do 
when framed?" he asked. "A 
professor Is not only admired 
but can be an object of 
vindication - say if he is a 
hard grader. A public charge 
can sometimes be as good as 
being guilty." 

That, Clausen pointed out, 
is why the guidelines are 
important. Confidentiality is 
necessary, she said, to both 
students and professors. 
Guidelines concerning ac- 
cess to records, hearing 
boards, formal reprisals and 
sanctions must be made 
clear. 

Indiana University and 
Purdue University are both 
expected to finalize their 
policies on sexual 
harassment by this spring, 
she said.

know how to use it. People at 
least have lo license their 
cars, "she added. 

But the people at Conroy's 
point to the Second Amend- 
ment U&gt; Ihe Constitution 
and say it guarantees them a 
right to own a gun. Johnson's 
reasoning is that the foun- 
ding fathers didn't trust 
having a large standing 
Army that might someday 
be used in a government 
lake-over by a dictator. And 
so a small civilian voluntary 
force was needed that could 
be "ready at a moment's 
notice" to protect the 
country. 

"We are no longer living in 
Ihe same limes as were 
those who wrote the Con- 
stitution," Squadrito replied. 

"And Constitutional 
amendments are purposely 



vague. Besides, Ihe Con- 
stitution is not God, we wrote 
it and we can change it just 
as wehavedone before," she 
said. 

"Of course it is belter lo 
know how to use a gun if you 
are going lo own one." 
Squadrito said about hand 
gun education courses. "Bui 
I believe that even owning a 
gun can lead lo violence," 
she added. 

"Jusl knowing that there 
is a gun in the drawer may 
make someone do something 
they wouldn't do other- 
wise—commit a crime or an 
act of violence that the 
person wouldn't think of 
doing if Ihe gun wasn't 
there, "she said.

Men split doubleheader 



ByMIKEFRANKE 
Chief Reporter 

After an opening season 
doubleheader loss to Bethel 
the IPFW baseball learn got 
into the win column with a 5- 
4 victory over Tri-State on 
March 26. The game was the 
first of two against Tri-State, 
and in the nightcap the 
Tuskers went down to defeat, 
3-t. 

Over spring break coach 
Larry Windmiller's squad 



traveled to Manchester for a 
March 31 doubleheader 

In the first game IPFW 
struck for (our runs in the 
third inning, and led 4-0 
going into the fourth. The 
Tuskers scored two more in 
the fourth to increase their 
lead to 6-0. That's when the 
roof fell in on IPFW. 

Manchester pounded out 
eight runs in their fourth, 
and went on to beat IPFW, 
12-9. Rick Stevens look the 



loss for the Tuskers. Don 
Hiden and Jim Butz smashed 
homeruns for EPFW 

In the second game, it was 
poor pitching and shoddy 
defense that opened the 
floodgates for a 9-6 Man- 
chester victory. - IPFW 
committed five errors in the 
field, and the pitching staff 
yielded 3 Manchester 
homeruns. Mike Hendricks 
was charged with the loss. 

In the doubleheader, the

Tuskers committed nine 
errors, and could manage 
only twelve basehits. 

On Saturday the Tuskers 
traveled to Ann Arbor, to 
play Spring Arbor Univer- 
sity, The result was two 
losses bythcsamescoreofB- 
3. 

Despite the losses and the 
team's 1-7 record, Coach 
Larry Windmiller sees 
brighter days ahead. "I see 
improvement in each game 
we play. The hitting is 
coming around. We just have 
to learn to gel the big hit al 
Ihe right time," he said. 

This has been a glaring 
problem with the team all 
year. Failing to get the 
"clutch" hit with men in 
scoring position has cost the 
team a few victories in the 
early going. 

The team did cut down on 
its errors in the Spring Arbor 
doubleheader. In the 
nightcap, the Tuskers played 
errorless baseball. 

Another problem with the 
team has been their in- 
consistent pitching staff . The 
pitchers seem to fool op- 
posing batters in the early 
innings, but it isn't long 
before the opposition hitters 
catch on to them. Coach 
Windmiller feels the reason 
for that is quite simple. "Our

The wind was blowing and 

temperatures struggled over

didn't discourage the 1,031

together most of the raceand 
paced one another If Cindy

gotten out ahead of me,

For those people jusl

program. Tony Ventrella has 
a few basic tips on how to 



become physically fit and 
enjoy it at the same time. 

He recommends a 
separate program for men 
and women, although one 
aspect is true for everyone. 
Ventrella said, "You have to 
develop a running style that 
feels comfortable to you. 
There is a right way and a 
wrong way of running long 
distances and your body will 
tell you when you're doing it 
incorrectly." 

Is running all that It takes 
to be physically fit? Ven- 
trella says, "No, you have to 
develop a program that 
includes other daily exer- 
cises like sit-ups, light 
weight dumb bells, and for 
the guys, a bench press 
workout." 

Those starting a program 
should remember that 
overdoing at the outset can 
be dangerous. Ventrella 
feels that a half mile a day 
for a beginner is a long 
enough run for the first 
week. 

The second week's running 
can be increased lo three 
quarters of a mile per day, 
and from that point on you'll 
know what your body can 
take.

IPFW was a homerun by 
Doug Grover in the second 
game. 

The team was to play 
Aquinas on Sunday, but 
travel problems forced the 
Michigan school to cancel 
Ihe game. IPFW played 
Saint Francis on Tuesday, 
and Will host IUPU at 
Indianapolis on Saturday.
