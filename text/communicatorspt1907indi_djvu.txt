With so much piled

can also eliminate the

It is also impor-

The results of this

ANNUAL AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY WALK 
SERVES AS PLATFORM FOR EARLY DETECTION 



Theatre buffs and 
researchers alike will 
now have an online re- 
source to IPBJ's rich 
theatre history with 
the launching of On- 
stage at IPEW. 

The new digital 
collection. facili- 
tated by the IPFW 
Walter E. Helmke Li- 
brary staff, will be 
available Sept. 2B at 
http://onEtage.mdon. 
■' lib.ipfw.edu. 

OnStage at IPFW is a 
collection of theatre 
maiKirabilla beginning 
with the first Pur- 
due - Indiana Theatre 
(PIT) production in 
1964. 

It will Include a 
representative se- 
lection of programs , 
photographs, and oth- 
er material as avail- 
able, fcom all pcoduc- 
tions in each season. 



If you're a female 
over the age of 40, you 
need to get a yearly 
maimogtam. 

It's a guideline 
touted by the American 
Cancer Society year af- 
ter year, yet accord- 
ing to recent research, 
manmography rates have 
declined significantly 
in the United States. 

According to the June 
15, 2007 issue of Can- 
cer, a peer- reviewed 
journal of the Aioeri- 
can Cancer Society, 
screening mammgraphy 
rates to detect breast 
cancer fell by as much 
as four percent nation- 
wide between 2000 and 
2005. 

TMs is the first 
study to show that the 
trend is nationwide 
among women for whcm 

liie test is intended to 
reduce mortality risk. 



Regular manwography 
is the most effective 
screening test 'for the 
early detection of 
breast cancer avail- 
able to woinen today. 

Hot only does it de- 
tect early tumors In 
breast tissue, but also 
its widespread use by 
wranen over 40 years old 
since the 1980s has 
lead to a reduction in 
breast cancer mortality 
in the United States. 

In addition, the 
American Cancer Soci- 
ety Eecwnnends the use 
of a magnetic resonance , 
imaging {MRI) test for 
those women with in- 
creased risk factors. 

Since maranography is 



the I 






accessible way to de- 
tect breast cancer, it 
is a disturbing de- 
cline-especially since 
breast cancer is 98 
percent survivable if 
detected early. 

The American Cancer 

SocleEy is doing Irs 
part to make sure wom- 



en over age 40 receive 
a yearly manmogcam, 
most notably through 
the 10th annual Making 
Strides Against Breast 
Cancer, a noncompeti- 
tive walk that will 
take place on Satur- 
day. Oct. 6 at Headwa- 
ters Park East in Foct 
Wayne. 

This year, partici- 
pants will be helping 
to raise awareness of 
the disproportionate 
incidence and mortality 
rates that affect our 
nation's undecserved, 
underinsured and ml - 
norlty populations. 

The American Cancer 
Society will be edu- 
cating Making Strides 
Against Breast Cancer 
participants about the 
limited accesslbll - 
ity to early detection 
methods that afflict 
certain connunities . 

"It's no secret that 
early detection saves 
lives and increases 

said Kathie Reigle it m 



Fleck, area executive 
director of the Amer- 
ican Cancer Society, 
Great Lakes Division. 
"That's v^y the Ameri- 
can Cancer Society is 
fighting for llfesav- 
ing access to mamnogra- 
phy among our nation's 
underserved , under- 
insured and minority 
populations . " 

The American Cancer 
Society plays a criti- 
cal role In not only 
referring wcsien to this 
program but . also by 
lobbying state and fed- 
eral governments for 
increased funding for 
the National Breast and 
Cervical Cancer Early 
Detection Program (tffiC- 
CEDP). 

The NBCCEDP helps 
low- income, uninsured 
and underserved women 
gain access to screen- 
ing exams, such as mam- 
mography .

A G.I. JOE Foreign Policy 



By BRANDON HARNISH 



If you've ever had the 
privilege of watching 
the 1980s cartoon G-I, 
JOE, you know all about 
COBRA, a cold-blooded 
terrorist organization 
bent on world domina- 
tion. Why world domi- 
nation? 

Well, the series nev- 
er did go into much de- 
tail - but it was clear 
that they were enemies 
of freedom and under 

we have COBRA running 
around uncontested. 

Enter G.I. JOE, these 
guys were Real Ameri- 
can Heroes and they 
always saved the day. 
Every scheme that CO- 
BRA hatched was foiled 
by our American good 
guys, such as a sa- 
distic attempt to rain 
down alien spores onto 
Earth. G.I. JOE was al- 
ways ready to defend 



world freedom and did 
so every Saturday morn- 
ing, with little to no 

Regrettably, the

Enough with grease-give me some vegetables/ 



By KELLV HCLENDOH 
mclek01Sipfw.edu 



With the meager selec- 
tion of Pizza Hut. Taco 
Bell and Subway, it's 
not too difficult to 
choose v^t to eat for 
lunch on campus. The 
choice of only three 
on-campus restaurants 
seems bleak. The lunch 
situation didn't always 
used to be this way, 
however. Not many peo- 
ple know that IPfW used 
to have a full cafete- 
ria, offering much more 
food than the three 
franchises currently in 



place offer. Maybe this 
is an option to solve 
the undiverslfied eat- 
ery options on campus. 
So , what would happen 
if IPFW brought their 
old cafeteria back? 
"It would depend on 
what they would sell 
for lunch, because if 
it's like back in high 
school with pizza pock- 
ets, than 'no thanks. '" 
said freshman Chelsea 

Agreeably, the lack of 
food problan wouldn't 
be solved if a cafe- 
teria served the same 
garbage high schools 
do. Regardless , there 



are nany advantages to 
reinstating the caf- 
eteria. Reduced lunch 
cost, healthier meals, 
larger and diversified 
selection, are includ- 
ed in this list. Plus, 
adding a cafeteria 
would up the selection 
of menu choices. 
"There isn't a big se- 
lection now and if you 
want to eat on campus 
it kind of forces you 
to eat junk- Subway is 
the only kind of healthy 
food if you don't add 
all the mayo." Campos 
added 

While Subway seems to 
be the healthiest op- 



tion, most tables in 
the vicinity of the 
sandwich counter are 
filled, leaving stu- 
dents to look for seat- 
ing on the chairs around 
the ground and first 
floors of Kettler. An 
expanded cafeteria or 
new seating area would 
solve this problem. An 
example of a success - 
ful cafeteria or 'food 
court ' includes the 
many dining options at 
lU Blooraington. Several 
little restaurants and 
cafes on their campus 
offer different foods, 
such as turkey burg- 
ers , soups , and fresh 



fruit, among others, have to disappear, ei- 
Although they have many ther. They could co-ex- 
more students, it would ist inside a "cafeteria 
still be nice to have food court" setting,

they do. Why not create and vegetarian options

New Branch of Homeland Security 
to point Spy Satellites at U.S. 



By DOUG SCHMIDT 
schradnOI^ipfw-Gdu 



Beginning October 1. 
the recently -created 
National Applications 
Office vdll begin con- 
ducting aucveillance 
inside the United 
States. 

Until now, nonmili- 
tary use of spy satel- 
lites has been largely 
restricted to scientif- 
ic uses like niapnaMng. 
monitoring storms and 
geological research. 

But the li^.O, a branch 
of the Department of 
Homeland Security, 

will give the FBI, bor- 
der security, local 
police and other do- 
mestic agencies access 
to military spy satel- 
lites , allowing than to 
watch any location in 
the country. 

Public databases like 
Google Earth allow us- 
ees to see satellite 
photos, but the in^ges 
do not ccroe close to 
the detail provided by 
a military satellite. 

According to an arti- 
cle in The Wall Street 
Journal, the military 
satellites to be used 
by the NAG are capable 
of taking real-time . 
high-resolution iina g - 
es, using radar or in- 
frared to watch an area 
at night and even de-

tecting people inside 
of buildings. 

What has the DHS done 
to insure that the 
KAO's domestic spying 
does not violate Ameri- 
cans' privacy rights? 

So far. very little. 

In a letter to St 
tary of Homeland Secu- 
rity Michael Chert off 
Congressman Bennie G 
Thompson (D-i'Iiss) said 
"There is effective 



ly no legal framework 
governing the domestic 
use of satellite imag- 
ery. . .Without this le- 
gal framework, the De- 
partment runs the risk 
of creating a program 
that . . . could be mis- 
used and violate Amer- 
icans' Constitutional 

One reason for the 
lack of a legal frame- 
work is that the ex- 



ecutive branch created 
the MAO without the in- 
volvement of Congress. 
In fact, at a meet- 
ing earlier this month, 
monbers of the House 
Comnittee on Homeland 
Security complained 
that they did not even 
learn that the new of- 
fice existed until it 
was mentioned in The 
Wall Street Journal. 
The MAO will be over- 



seen by DHS officials 
and the Office of the 
Director of National 
Intelligence. 

The DHS will approve 
requests for satellite 
surveillance inter- 
nally, without seeking 
warrants from judges. 

The DHS has not re- 
leased any details to 
Congress about the ex- 
act guidelines it will 
use to approve requests 
or how information 
gathered by surveil- 
lance will be used. 

In written testimony 
to the House Conmittee 
on Homeland Security, 
Dan Sutherland, DHS Of- 
ficer for Civil Rights 
and Civil Liberties , 
responded to conmittee 
members' concerns about 
NAO surveillance. 

According to Suther- 
land, the DHS will be 
"keeping a watchful 
eye on several key civ- 
il liberties Issues." 
In other words , "just

an foray could have un- 
intended consequences. 
After all. in car- 
toon-world the mission 
is always accomplished 
and done so with minl- 
iihI losses . However , 
there exists a very 
real difference between 
the cartoon-world G.I. 
JOE/COBRA scenario and 
the reality of interna- 
tional relations. 

The G.I. JOE foreign 
policy is epitomized by 
the Iraq War and the 
notion that U.S. mili- 
tary force can somehow 
bring peace and stabil- 
ity to the world and 
do so without repercus- 
sions. 

The current mess in 
Iraq is proof -posi- 
tive that a serious 
and overarching change 
in foreign policy is 
needed 

After several seasons 
of warfare, the G. I, 
JOES finally destroyed 
COBRA'S headquarters 
by use of a nuclear 
wsrhsad. I'm afraid to 
say that if our G.I. 
JOE foreign policy con- 
tinues we can expect an 
identical outcome. 

With nearly every 
presidential candidate 
(the exception being 
Ron Paul) refusing to 
take pre-emptive nu- 
clear war off the ta- 
ble, what other conclu- 
sion could I possibly 
come to 7

students buy points

IPEW should have a meal 
plan program. 

It would nake pur- 
chasing food so much 
easier. 

Another food related 
cause to bring up is 
vending. 

What about vending 
machines with fruit or 



yogurt? 

There are certainly 
enough with chips and 
candy. But, vhy can't 
there be both: chips 
and candy, fruit and 
yogurt? Don't abolish 
all unhealthy food , 
because occasional- 
ly vrfien the work gets 
tough, it's good to 
havp a TVix bar, add 
healthy to the selec- 
tion choice. 

"It nakes it hard if 
you're trying to eat 
good and all there is 
are chips and cook- 
ies in the vending ma- 
chines," Campios said. 

Sadly, until new 
restaurants are es- 
tablished , those who 
don't enjoy having the 
same food every day 
will have to pack their 
lunches , or drive off 
campus.

411 Under the Sun 



By STEPHEN HORNER 



More Than One 411 Under 
the Sun 

Local directory as- 
sistance has changed- 
Up until the 1980s 411 
calls were free in the 
US. 

Now most 411 calls are 
made via cell phones , 
with callers being 
billed on average Si. 25 
per use. Well, several 
companies have stepped 
forward with an answer 
for custcmers weary of 
such charges. 

These alternatives 
are: Free411 



( 1 -BOO-FREE-411) 
TellHe (1-800-555- 

TELL) Goog411 (1- 

800-GOOG-411) 
Each offer directo* 
ry assistance free of 
charge with varying 
levels of extra func- 
tionality. 

Both Free411 and 
TellHe Include some 
level of voiced ads 
which slow down the 
process, vMle GO0G411 
seemed most accessible 
and responsive at the 
time of this review. 

As a Microsoft sub- 
sidiary, TellHe offers 
more than just direc- 
tory assistance. 

It can return informa- 
tion on news, weather, 



sports, stock quotes, 
in addition to business 
searching. It appears 
TellMe intends for its 
service to go beyond 
expected 411 features. 
Likewise, each service 
makes use of text roes- 
sages to varying de- 
grees of functional- 
ity. 

Ultimately, services 
such as these will al- 
low users of land lines 
and cell phones a voice 
recognition portal to 
many services once only 
assessable via direct 
internet access , all 
without requiring hu- 
man intervention on 
the part of the service 
provider. 



Exploring the options 
that each of these 
unique services pro- 
vides gives an indica- 
tion of what the future 
in telephony techno! - 
ogy will bring. 

I expect these -^11 
alternatives to improve 
continually , offering 
expanded services in 
the future.

Baggy sweatshirts .

Marin is a paradox in the world of entertainment. As an actor, director,

Mean Girls and Bar Brawls 



By Jessie Ruckuian 



flecently, while 
out with the boys 
at a local dance 
bar . I was lucky 
enough to witness 
one of the great- 
est catfight in the 
history of my adult 
life. Two grown 
women were fighting 
one another like 
rabid wolves over 
a guy. This is a 
phenomenon that is 
best left to the 
tcashy experts who 
grace the Maury Po- 
vich show daily. 

Before you grab 
that girl's cheap 
weave, stop and re- 
think. Let 's pause 
that fist and fly- 
ing glass in mid- 
air and talk this 



Seriously? 



You 



are going to 'slap- 
aho ' over that jerk 
next to you who is 
smirking into his 
drink, thinking 
that he's the man? 
(It's obvious to me 
as a bystander that 
you are being played 
in a big. bad way . 
and fighting some 
other scorned woman 
for him is not the 
way to go. Fight- 
ing someone else 
for that trash is 
just plain stupid. 



For people like me, 
I hate to see two 
dumb animals go at 

And once you toss 
your self-respect 
out the window 
for that guy , your 
rep goes down in 
flames like Britney 
Spears ' career . 

Zing! 



I have been in 
this position be- 
fore with a guy. . . 
we' 11 call him 
Dirtbag. Dirtbag 
and I dated for al- 
most a year before 
I caught him mak- 
ing out in a park- 

skank. Once the 
two were busted . 
"Skank" came run- 
ning at me , look* 
ing for a figbt. 
She still dislikes 
me, years later. 
Again , go back to 
the 'dumb animal' 
example if you are 
just as confused as 
I am. 

For all I knew, 
"Skank" didn ' t even 
know I existed . . . 
Dirtbag probably 
told her I was his 
roommate. or God 
forbid , his sister . 



drama is likely not 
of her doing, but 
his. And while 
there are women out 
there who make it a 
point to steal men 
from their signifi- 
cant others, it's 
not as widespread 
as one may think. 
Typically that is

Problems in South Bend VVho'sTo Blame at Notre Dame? 

Offense vs. Defense 



Notre Dame's Football Program heading south in South Bend 



By SHAWN ROBINSON 



So, have you ever won- 
dered why teams play 
the way they do? Many 
college teams have the 
advantage of having 
experience that could 
potentially guide them 
to a winning season 
or better. This is 
true because of the 
red shirt affect that 
can happen with cer- 
tain players. When a 
player is red shirted, 
they sit out the up 
coming season and are 
eligible the following 
season. Usually this 
concept is used with 
quarterbacks . What 
does this have to do 
with anything, well, 
Notre Dame has always 
been knawn for their 
prestigious quartet- 
backs. Some of them 
have gone on to the 
NFL to accomplish many 
feats; others have 
just gone to the NFL 
to prolong a career. 

Recently Norte Dame 
has suffered a loss in 
the quarterback po- 
sition, losing Brady 
Quliui. Now. there are 
always the "haters" 



that say that he was/ 
is a joke. For those 
people that say that , 
I can come up with a 
couple of things that 
could back my statement 
up that he was one of 
the best quarterbacks 
that has passed through 
Notre Dame. I could 
go on about how he has 
broken many records , 
both school and NCAA, 
but I am not going to 
do that. 

The subject on hand 
is the fact that Notre 
Dame does not have a 
dominant quarterback to 
lead then to victory. 
Their O-line is noth- 
ing to brag about, but 
without a leader taking 
snaps on the field , you 
might as well kiss that 
team good-bye. Charley 
Weis is at the helm of 
the Fighting Irish, but 
coaching can only go as 
far as the sidelines, 
it ' s the players that 
make the game in the 
end. Notre Dame, this 
year, has not yet scored 
a touchdown on offense. 
How is a team supposed 
to win when they have 
no offense and no 0- 
line to protect their 
quarterback? For one, 
they do not even have a 
designated QB to lead 



their team. They have 
Danetrius Jones and 
Jirany Clausen at quar- 
terback at the moment, 
and Clausen was chosen 
for the last game to 
start. These two ate 
basically the only wor- 
thy ones to step up to 
the plate and try to 
lead this team. 



mind every time some 
one says anything about 
Notre Dame . and that 
statement is, "This is 
Notre Dame ' s rebuild - 
ing year." I want 
to think that this is 
not true, because when 
these words creep into 
my mind, I think los- 
ing. I do not want 
to think of them los- 
ing, I want to think 
about them winning like 
they consistently have 
done in the past. For 
Weis, this year will 
be tough, and he will 
have to defend himself 
everyday until they 
achieve a win. For 
the team in general, it 
seems to me that they 
just need to find a way 
to come together the 
best way they can and 
win a game. 



By KEN FOWLER 
U-WIRE 



Where was John Sulli- 
van? The fifth-year se- 
nior captain cost ^k)tre 
Dame any early momentum 
by beginning the game 
with a snap over fresh- 
man Acnnndo Allen's 
head, a snap that led 
to a 17 -yard loss and 
the Irish having a sec- 
ond-and-Z7 from their 
own 1-yard line seconds 
into the game. 

Where was any offen- 
sive veteran stepping 
up to help the young 
kids? Nowhere. 

When talent graduates, 
you need guys who can 
corral the young play- 
ers and find the best 
in them. On offense, 
Notre Dame has forced 
the worst to come out 
of its inexperienced 
but talented freshmen 
and sophomores. 

At this point, Char- 
lie Weis has to stop 
thinking about what 
he owes his fifth- 
year guys. Irish fans 
shouldn ' t complain if 
he benches John Carl- 
son in favor of Will 



Yeatman. who has been 
a better blocker - and 
a bigger asset to the 
team - in three games 
this season . No one 
should complain if John 
Sullivan takes a seat 
in favor of Thomas Be- 
menderfer. the junior 
transfer from North- 



about experience? Noth- 
ing. 

That doesn't mean 
that Weis ' job should 
be safe and the coaches 
aren't to blame. Of- 
fensive line coach John 
Latina has as nany four 
and five-star players 
as any coach in the 



"Veterans deserve l"l ^ fl 

nothing. The defense 1^^ ^tn

who grew up in 
Mishawaka. 

And no one should 
complain if Travis 
Thomas takes a game or 
two off because of his 
poor play and stupid 
penalties. 

In fact, people \^o 
care about the program 
should complain if Weis 
isn ' t willing to make 
a change from the vet- 
erans to younger guys. 
Some of the veterans 
have had their shot 
this year and failed . 
If they can't get the 
job done or help the 
younger guys develop, 
then what's so great 



w a r - 
rant a firing, nothing 

But more than any 
thing else right now, 
Notre Dame needs a lead - 
er on offense. It needs 
a wholesale change 
and not just swapping 
a few offensive line- 
men frcsn play to play. 
If the offense sputters 
next week, Weis needs 
to send in the entire 
second string for a se- 
ries or two to shake 
things up. 

Veterans deserve 
nothing. The defense 
deserves better.
