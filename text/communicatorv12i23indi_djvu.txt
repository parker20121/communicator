Sallay refines test to detect cancer

ByJ.C.GRISWOLD 
Staff Writer 
Under the supervision of JoAnne 
Patterson, a registered nurse, about 
SO fPFW student-nurses recently 
donated their blood to Dr. Stephen 
Sallay 's research for the detection of 
cancer. 

Sallay, an IPFW chemist- 
professor, believes he has refined a 
test he calls the "Modified Hershey 
Method" which is useful for 
monitoring cancer patients. 

The original Hershey Method was 
developed by Dr. Davidson of the 
Hershey Medical Center in Hershey, 
Pa,, who published his first paper in 
1979 describing the method of 
detecting cancer from blood serum. 
IPFW researchers, led by Sallay, 
improved and modified Davidson's 
methodology. 

Sallay also is working on a new- 
approach that could ultimately 
detect cancer before it has reached 
the metastatic stage — a state in 
which the cancer is no longer 
localized but has spread throughout 
the body. "Sixty to 80 percent of 
those that have died from cancer 
could have been rescued if the 
cancer had been detected early," 
Sallay said. 

Cancer kills more than 400,000 
Americans per year. 

This new method of delecting 
cancer can also be used to help 
doctors determine whether a cancer 
patient is responding to treatment. 

The blood given by students was 
used to establish a baseline, a norm, 
for the amount of sialic acid, a 
molecule which is used as a 
biological marker, found in the 
membranes of normal and cancer 
cells. The cancer cell membranes 
exhibit at least twice as high level of 
sialic acid than the normal cell 
membranes. 

By using the baseline established 
from the students' normal blood, 
Sallay can compare this baseline to 



the amount of sialic acid found in the 
blood serum of cancer patients. 
Finding a high level of sialic acid 
means that there is a strong 
possibility of cancer or that the 
cancer is recurring. 

The Modified Hershey Method was 
found at the Parkview Onology 
Center to be more sensitive then 
present existing biological tests. 
Sallay said, however, that this 
method of detecting cancer is still in 
its early stages of development. 

By using actual cancer patients' 
blood given to them by Parkview 
and Lutheran hospital doctors, 
Sallay and his associate Winnie 
Prosise are checking the statistical 
reliability of the new method. 

They have already tested about 
150 cases, and hope to test up to 1,000 
this year. By testing a large number 
of cases, Prosise said the statistical 
significance of the Modified Hershey 
Method will be enhanced^ 
establishing it in the medical 
community. 

The local team has been working 
on the "Modified Hershey Method" 
for more than three years. 

Sallay believes this project is 
unique because, unlike some 
research projects he worked on 
before, this project has become a 
"community effort." 

The research is funded by local 
firms, mostly by Thermion Products 
and Central Soya. The researchers 
have already received over $100,000 
for research support. 

The local business community, 
Sallay said, and both the Parkview 
and the Lutheran hospitals have 
been very helpful in his research. He 
said he owes special thanks to Dr. 
Steven C. Meyer, Dr Thomas G 
Garbrys and Dr. Richard F. Fox, his 
main collaborators in supplying him 
with blood samples of cancer 
patients, and to both Mary Beth 
Bloom and Jeanene Eifrid, oncology 
lab technician at Parkview.

Students want jobs, get education 



By JAMIE WISE 
Staff Writer 

Jobs are what people need to get 
through school. Better jobs are what 
they hope for once they graduate. 
Because of the economy, jobs, lost or 
hoped-for, are bringing people back to 
school in numbers. 

The enrollment at IPFW has in- 
creased by 10-12 percent in the past 
year, said Philip Kennel, director of 
Admissions. 

While it is true that some students 
have been forced to quit school due to 
lack of funds, the majority are con- 
tinuing their education under less-than- 
wonderful circumstances, Mike Franke 
of the Financial Aid office told the 
Communicator. 

"Take me," said junior Ellen 
Engleman, "I'm poor as a beach bum. 
But I finally got a job and I was real 
lucky." 

Ellen is now working two nights a 
week from 11 p.m. - 7 a.m on the 
Student Patrol. She found her job 
through the campus personnel office. 
She tried the Job Locator service, too, 
before she "got lucky" and got the 
patrolling job. 

Students are moving back into their 



hometown to stay in school, said 
Franklin Kenworthy, Assistant Vice 
Chancellor and Dean of Academic 
Services. 

"They "'caVt "afford"" the "front" 
load— room, board, tuition. I've seen 
them come from everywhere. Here we 
have no penalty for the part-time 
student. They pay by the credit hour. 
And it's cheaper living at home," 
Kenworthy said. 

He used the term "stopping out" 
rather than "dropping out" for students 
who quit when funds run out More than 
likely they'll return to school, he said. 

Joan Eaton, director of Financial 
Aid, also reported a large increase in 
students seeking and receiving 
financial aid, largely due to the 
economy. Applications for the National 
Direct Student Loan, currently at four 
percent interest, and bank-financed 
loans, at nine percent, should be filed in 
her office as soon as possible, she said. 
The IPFW enrollment has gone up as 
people have signed up for classes after 
they were laid-off or terminated 
from Fort Wayne firms and factories. 
Kennel said, "when people get laid off 
or terminated, they say to themselves, 
'I've had no control over my life so 



maybe I should take a two-year or four- 
year degree.' They realize they are at 
the mercy of society without a 
degree." 

Eaton mentioned one woman in her 
early twenties who had recently been 
laid-off at International Harvester and 
sought financial aid. 

She told Eaton she knew she was 
going to get laid-off and needed 
financial help. Education, to this 
woman, was the "only way to get 
ahead." She said she was glad her 
mother had been so strict with her and 
wished she hadn't talked back so much 
and "been so sassy." . 

Denny Boester, Veterans Benefits 
counselor, attributes the recession and 
lack of jobs to the continually stable 
enrollment of veterans here, even 
though the number qualifying has 
consistently decreased over the past 
few years 

There has also been an increase in 
career-oriented programs. Nursing and 
engineering are up 300 majors from last 
year alone, Kenworthy noted. 
Enrollment in education, computer and 
supervision and business courses, has 
risen. Conversely Arts and Letters 




degree programs are suffering a 
downturn, he said. 

Carl Bickley, dean of transitional 
studies, can foresee enrollment 
dropping only "if the recession con- 
tinues and people run out of cash 
resources or borrowing power." Even 
then, he said, they might drop from a 
12-hour load to six. 

That hasn't happened yet. In fact, the 
total course load has gone up, said 
Kenworthy, 

People seem to be seeking 
education in spite of economic hard- 
ship The underlying optimism is that 
while higher education does not ensure 
a better future, chances are it can help 
a great deal. 



Gray Panthers organize 



■y WAYNE STEFFEN 
Staff Writer 

Yesterday you were 64 and could 
handle all the responsibilities of your 
job. Today you turned 65. 

At lunchtime everybody gathers 
around your desk. They take you by the 
arm and out to a restaurant. You get 
some champagne, a gold watch is 
thrust under your nose, and you are told 
to take your nameplate off the door on 
your way out. 

The Gray Panthers are trying to 
eliminate such scenes by abolishing 
mandatory retirement rules. This is the 
primary reason why Maggie Kuhn 
founded the organization in 1975 and 
one reason Benjamin Becker has begun 
a chapter inFort Wayne. "Many people 
want to work past 65," said Becker, a 
biology professor at IPFW. "And for 
those who don't, we can educate them 
to their possibilities," he said. 

Education is the Panthers' tool. 
Books, pamphlets, and magazines by 
the organization and appearances by 
Maggie Kuhn are designed to teach 
everyone of the contributions the 
elderly can make to their community. 

In an interview with Ihe Com- 
municator, Becker said that the 
Panthers "want people of all ages who 
are willing to give of themselves to all 
humans." And the group especially 
wants "people to work." 

There are several projects in the 
making. The first is a series of free 
summer classes called "Gateway to 
Learning." The classes will be two hour 
seminars on subjects ranging from 
sciences to languages and art. The 
classes will be given at IPFW and 
taught by volunteers from many city 




Local Gray Panther leader, Benji 
colleges. Becker said that the program 
will be designed to "whet the appetite" 
for education among theelderly. 

A second program for local Panthers 
is a vegetable co-op. With produce 
either contributed by local gardeners 
or laken on consignment, vegetable 
stands would be set up to sell their 
products. 

"We would like to establish four 
stands in different parlsof the city. The 
stands would be run by volunteers and 
provide fresh food at reduced prices to 
people who may never have tasted a 
tomato picked the same day," Becker 
said. 

This project reflects the Panthers' 
concern about health and nutrition. It is 
believed that many older people, for 
reasons of either economics or con- 



min Becker. (Photo by Keith Hall: 

Becker is also enlisting the aid of 
some of .IPFW's denial hygiene 
students to give free oral examinations 
to the elderly. "The students could not 
actually do much work on the teeth 
because they aren't dentists. But they 
could educate people in proper dental 
care and tell them where to go for 
help," he said 

A health problem for the elderly that 
is only now being studied is stress. Too 
much stress may be causing organic 
breakdown in individuals. The rise of 
heart disease may be correlative to the 
increase of stress in modern society. 
"Much stress comes from our first-is- 
best altitude in America. You read 
magazines and watch television and see 
thai first is right and the other 99 
percent of the people are wrong," 
Becker said, 

"The mosl stressful single event in a 



person's life is the loss of a spouse," 
said Becker. Living alone also can be 
harmful for older people but moving 
them into a nursing home is oflen 
worse. "Indiana has some of the lowest 
standards for nursing homes in the 
country," said Becker, "and even 
many of those are not met." 

To combat the loneliness of older 
people, the Gray Panthers hope to set 
up a call-in service. Callers would get a 
friendly ear lo listen to their problems 
and perhaps receive help. 

Volunteer and port-time jobs get 
older people back in the work force, and 
they are fine as far as they go, Becker 
said, but asks, "Why must the volun- 
teers always be older? What about Ihe 
top-level paying jobs?" A common 
attitude is that younger people will stay 
in a job longer. "But as mobile as our 
society is and as fast as people change 
jobs, that just isn't true," Becker said. 

Another situation where common 
attitudes are untrue is with older 
people's sexuality, Becker said. "Older 
people can enjoy sex, too," he said. 
"We are taught that only younger 
people have needs." 

The local Gray Panther group may 
not get very big because Becker "needs 
people lo work, not just sit around." But 
Ihey will be "leaders and coordinators" 
with other organizations, such as the 
Women's Institute and the Area HI 
Council on Aging. 

"People shouldn't underestimate the 
Gray Panthers," Becker said. The 
organization will become involved in 
area politics. "We won't be running 
candidates, but we will support 
legislation and be Involved with city 
politics as well," he said,

PIT costume workshop 
fits 'Tartuffs' players 



by GLORIA HJZER 
Staff Writer 

A quick glance into Kettler G35 will 
reveal a small cluttered room, strewn 
with fabric bolts and swatches, sewing 
machines, dress form mannequins and 
numerous thread scraps and pins. 

What would appear to be Cinderella's 
house on the night of the ball is actually 
the PIT costume workshop in a frenzied 
effort to design and construct the 
eleborate costumes for the coming 
production of Moliere's "Tartuffe." 

Capturing the flavor and atmosphere 
of the period is one of the greatest 
challenges, according to Patricia 
Sweet, costume designer for the 
theater. The elaborate costumes, 
designed for the wealthy class in 17th 
century France, are made of such 
luscious materials as brocade and are 
trimmed with yards and yards of lace 
and braid. And these are just the men's 
costumes. 

"This is one of the few times in the 
history of costuming that the men 
really out do the women. The men wear 
more make-up and have shoulder 
length wigs. They wear beauty marks, 
lipstick and tons of jewelry while the 
women are kind of subdued," Sweet 
said. 

But since this was a very flirtatious 
period, the women's clothes tend to be 
very low cut and somewhat exposing. 
"The look is a very flat chest — they 
don't have any bust but they have a lot 
of cleavage," said Sweet. And the only 
way to achieve this look is to use cor- 
sets. "The corsets we are using are 
ones we have built here in the workshop 
and they all have iron and steel stays in 
them," which, according to Sweet 
make sitting and moving painfully 
difficult. 

In addition lo getting accustomed to 
the corsets, the women had to do a lot of 
work with fans. According to Sweet. 
"They used fans at that time to give 
messages," and these meaningful 
signals and revealing dresses as well as 
the elegant and pompous look for the 
man "indicates the sexuality of the 
period." 



Building a production of this nature 
requires many procedures before the 
finished costume appears on stage. The 
costume designer begins by reading the 
script, taking careful notes of character 
personalities and visual requirements 
for the production. These initial ideas 
are transferred into sketches and 
discussed with the director and the 
scene designer. Then the research 
process begins. "We find out about the 
painters and the art work of the period 
and try to determine the flavor of 
whatever country is represented until 
we come up with a general at- 
mosphere," Sweetsaid, 

Next she takes the character ren- 
derings and buys the fabrics, many of 
which are drapery materials 

Then they start the building process 
which involves drafting their own 
patterns according to the 
measurements of each person. "None 
of the costumes come from store bought 
patterns," said Sweet. 

The entire show is first built out of 
muslin. After it has been fitted and the 
alterations made the muslin costumes 
are then carefully taken apart and used 
as the pattern for the finished product. 
Most of these muslin patterns are 
eventually built right into the actual 
costume for added body and durability. 
The final step is dress parade, at 
which the costumes are modeled on 
stage under the appropriate lighting 
where they must pass final inspection. 
Any necessary corrections must be 
made in those few remaining days 
before opening night. 

Sweet is assisted by an advanced 
costume design class. They spend a full 
month on a production and work on 
other designs and class projects for the 
remainder of the semester. 

"This show has been a real learning 
experience for most of the theater 
students," said Sweet, who is very 
pleased and excited about the play 
which opens March 6. "We are doing 
something wealthy with bright colors 
and extravagant and lavish costumes 
which always seems to make a show 
more fun and challenging, " she said. 



Booth set up for letter writing 



By JIM CHAPMAN 
Chief Reporter 

A booth will be set up today and 
Saturday in the basement of Kettler 
Hall with stationery and stamps 
provided by the Student Senate for 
Ihose wanting lo write letters lo Ihe 
Indiana State Legislature. 

In Its meeting March 4, the Senate 
resolved lo conduct a petitioning and 
letter writing campaign to the 
Legislature to limit o proposed 12 to 
IB percent Increase in tuition. The 
Increased tuition was recommended 
by Ihe State Budget Committee. 



The recommended raise Is due lo 
the Legislature's decision not to 
Increase funds going lo institutions 
of higher education, according to Ihe 
Student Senate. 

A Senate member sold that the 
stale ol Indiana has slipped from 33 
to 39 in the nation in receiving lunds 
from the State Legislature. 

Sample letters and petitions will 
be available from the Senate as a 
model; however, students can write 
their own letters and add their own 
personal touches to them. 

The Senate will send nil letters.

Senate scenario 
not ideal says Senator 



Legislators unveil budget 



The Indiana General Assemably is in its 
last weeks of the '81 session. The legislators 
unveiled their 1981-83 budget recom- 
mendations last week, and the state's 
program allotments look thin. 

Students and faculty members should be 
aware of the recommendations made by the 
State Budget Committee: A 12 percent in- 
crease in student fees; only a A percent 
faculty increase each year; and a freezing of 
student aid at the 1980-81 levels. 

We urge all who are concerned about these 
long-reaching recommendations to write or 



call area legislators. A good way to do this 
would be to visit the booth set up Students' 
Government, today and Saturday, in the 
basement of Kettler Hail and take advantage 
of their free stationery and postage provided 
for letters to the legislators. 

Or call the General Assembly's toll free 
numbers to express your views. They are: 
Indiana House of Representatives, 1-800-382- 
0841; Indiana State Senate, 1-800-382-0467. 

Voting on the state budget will be done soon. 

It may already be too late, but we must try . 



Dear Editor, 

Like Sieve Riegel, I also 
attended the first production 
of "I Pagliacci." Although I 
hardly consider myself to be 
an "expert" or a 
"reviewer," anyone with a 
little music appreciation 
background could explain 
why Riegel found it "often 
impossible to distinguish 
words." It does not mean 
that the performers "fell 
short" and did not enunciate 
properly. It does mean tas in 
any opera), however, that 
because the singer's goal is 



Reader disagrees with 
'I Pagliacci' review 



to be literally heard, the text 
even in English is difficult to 
understand. 

Besides opera is a form of 
theatre, not theatre. And if 
the person specifically hired 
by the opera would have 
shown up during the 
rehearsals, there indeed 
would have been "some . 
collaboration with the IPFW 
theatre department in the 
form of coaching, 
movement, and set con- 
struction." Unfortunately 
this was not the case. Yes it 
would have been nice to have

gestures?? It was even the 
CITY police that had to 
subdue her and handcuff her.

Dear Editor, 

The editorial in the Feb. 26 
issue of The Communicator 
about Students' Government 
was well written, well 
thought out and fair. 
However, there are a few 
points I would like to expand 
on. 

The ideal scenario of the 
Senate would have at least 36 
candidates campaigning 
hard for the 18 Senate seats 
each spring. 

That scenario has not yet 
happened in my three years 
at IPFW. We have all heard 
the reasons before: apathy, 
lack of time, etc. The reality 
of the election situation is 
this: You might have up to 17 
Senators elected in the 
spring. The 18th seat has for 
two years remained open 
because no one from the Art 
School has run for that seat. 

The 17 elected will 
probably have run unop- 
posed. Few, if any will know 
what the Senate does, nor 
have any concrete plans for 
doing something once they 
are elected. 

After the elections, 
because of transfers to fl) 
and Purdue, lack of time, 
etc., resignations occur. 

The petitioning process is, 
realistically, the only way to 
recruit potential Senators. 

The editorial mentions 
that a person does not need 
to go outside the Students' 
Government offices to get 



the necessary 30 signatures 
for his or her petition. In 
theory, that is true, but in 
practice, no 3D people are in 
the offices at one time. 

It also mentions a clause in 
the Students' Government 
constitution that allows for a 
special election if there were 
a certain number of Senate 
or SUBOG vacancies. 
Students' Government has 
always interpreted the 
clause to mean there has to 
be both number of va- 
cancies at the same time. So 
we feel we have been 
following our constitution. 

The editorial also states 
that it is time for the Senate 
to "get their act together" 
and to stop "playing 
games." I could not agree 
more. But I must, however, 
shoulder part of the blame 
for letting the Senate drift 
aimlessly. 

I assumed that, as adults, 
Senators could think of 
projects for the Senate 
collectively to do, and then, 
to motivate themselves to 
complete their work. 
Unfortunately, I assumed 
wrongly. 

The Student Senate tries 
its best to represent IPFW, 
but we need your input. 
We're all in this thing called 
IPFW together. Help your 
Students' Government help 
you. 

Steve Westrick 
Student Body Vice-President 



complaint against THEM 
instead of the campus police 
who are employed here to 
help us? SOMEBODY has to 
keep students from parking 
their cars in the wrong 
places, so the rest of us^ who 
would like to be adult and 
considerate of others, can 
haveplacestopark. 

Mark Trademan 
EET 



ind other 

professional people 

someday, have - little 
patience with our fellow 
students who ignore the no- 
parking signs, flagrantly 
park in walk-ways or in the 
reserved areas for disabled. 
If it were not for that small 
percentage, we would not 
have to hire policemen at all. 
And then, if the citizens of 
the whole country would 
respect our police and our 
laws, instead of thumbing 
their noses at them, our 
streets would not be the 
unsafe places they are 
today!

"I have also found 
remarkable support here 
(D?FW), both from ad- 
ministration and students, " 
Sallay said. "We still have a 
small percentage of false 
positive results (indicating 
the possibility of cancer)," 
he said. 

He attributes these results 
to the fact that a high level of 
sialic acid could be the result 
of other diseases present in 
the body, such as arthritis, 

Sallay hopes to further 
develop the test and make it 
more accurate and sensitive 

While Sallay remains 
optimistic about improving 
his quest for early cancer 
detection, Dr. Meyer 
believes that Sallay 's and his 
colleagues' efforts might 
"someday put Fort Wayne 
on the oncology map of the 
world." 

The most popular color 
among young people today is 
blue. In a poll, the color blue 
stands out above the rest. 

There Is dark blue, light 
blue, navy blue and baby 
blue. Where did this color's 
popularity originate? Some 
say with the color of blue 
jeans came the popularity of 
blue. Others say it originated 
with God.

'Tartuffe' revels in irreverence 



Satire relevant 



By STEVE R1EGEL 

Arts Editor 
The current production 
of "Tartuffe," a comedy by 
Moliere, is the funniest show 
to have crossed the PIT 
stage in quite a while. 

Banned in 16W because of 
its religious criticism, 
"Tartuffe" has ripened with 
age. Its satire may not seem 
as painted today, but its 
ridicule of human vice and 
folly has taken on the added 
resonance of modern un- 
derstanding, making the 
play as relevant as ever. 

The PIT production, 
directed by Maureen 
O'Reilly, milks every comic 
nuance for its full effect. 

The comedy centers 
around Tartuffe 's (Larry 
Life) plot to swindle Orgon 
(Kin Detwilerl out of his 
house and money "by 
pretending to be a poor, 



religious zealot. Most of the 
people involved can see 
through the guise except 
those who matter most, 
Orgon and his mother 
(Donna T.Blackburn). 

Larry Life is delightful as 
the falsely pious Tartuffe. 
His greed as he munches a 
pear and swills Orgon 's 
wine, and his uncontrollable 
lust in the presence of 
Orgon's wife (Martha 
Wehrenberg), come through 
in hilarious style. 

The humor of Tartuffe's 
vice is complemented by 
Orgon's blind willingness to 
be duped. Kim Detwiler is 
very effective as a nobleman 
who want to be a good, kind 
person, but is intellectually 
incapable of doing so. 

The folly of Orgon and 
Tartuffe is balanced by the 
virtue and long-suffering of 



the rest of the family. 
Martha Wehrenberg makes 
Elmire very patient and 
kindhearted, although her 
actions are somewhat af- 
fected. 

One of the best per- 
formances comes from 
Sharon Seabold as the 
housemaid, Dorine. She is a 
saucy wench who is not 
afraid to tell anyone what 
she thinks. 

Other good performances 
are Darrell Hankey's 
Cleante, who comes off as 
the most intelligent 
character in the play, and 
Ranae Butler's Mariane, a 
whining little girl in love. 
Wendell Summers' Damis, 
Orgon's young son, 
flourishes his sword 
valiantly, but he tends to . 
recite Moliere's verse in a 
sing-song fashion.

Ensemble performs 



By NANCY SLICK 

Staff Writer 

The IPFW Wind Ensemble 
gave the third of its four 
annual concerts in the recital 
hall last Sunday. The 40- 
piece ensemble, which in- 
cludes primarily in- 
strumental music majors, is 
the university's lop or- 
chestra group. 

A mini -band which per- 
forms regularly on and off

acquire membership only 



through audition.

years. William F, Schlacks, 
an assistant professor of 
music, is thrilJed with the 
group. "It's a good bunch of 
kids ... fine, high-quality 
freshmen," he said. Half the 
ensemble this year is 
composed of freshmen. 

The group traveled to 
South Bend in 1977 and 
Mexico in 197B. "Since then," 
said Schlacks, "because 
money has not flowed, it has

the British Museum, by 
Gioacchino Rossini; "Petite

vignettes, by Luciano Berio; 
"Scaramouch," completed

music of contemporary wind

Schlacks feels the ensemble 
is not as well attended as he 
would like it to be and at- 
tributes the lack of great 
interest to the preference for 
jazz rather than a concert 
band. 



Film catches eye 



ByMIKEGEFFEN 
Chief Reporter 

This is a warning: "Don't 
blink during "Eyewitness;" 
you might miss something. 
Apparently director Peter 
Yates and writer Steve 
Tesich did. They leave too 
many loose ends dangling, 
but the film still works. 

"Eyewitness" is basically 
two films rolled into one. On 
the one hand, it is a romantic 
story about a janitor 
(William Hurt) and a T.V. 
reporter; on the other hand, 
it's a taut suspense film, for 
the most part, about a 
murder. The two halves are 
meshed together en- 
tertainingly, and make a fun 
intricate thriller. 

Like Hitchcock, Yates and 
Tesich make the mundane 
terrifying. A cable banging 
on a radiator becomes a 
signal of a murder, a trash 
compactor becomes a lethal 
weapon, and playing with a 
dog becomes a struggle of 
life and death. All of these 
details give the film a unique 
ambience, and root it in the 
real world. 



To give any details about Deever, gels a role with a 



the plot would spoil the film, 
but suffice to say that in 
order to meet the reporter, 
the janitor tells her he has 
information about a murder, 
and may or may not be 
telling the truth The plot 
would have made Hitchcock 
proud, and has a lot of twists 
and turns— maybe a few too 
many for the film's own 
good. Yates and Tesich 
seemed to get sidetracked by 
them and never fully pull all 
of them together. 

Tesich is a good writer who 
is bemused by the little 
things in life. Scenes that 
would be filled with mun- 
dane dialogue in another 
writer's hands are turned 
around by Tesich and given 
witty undercurrents. For 
example, only Tesich could 
write a scene about waxing 
floors that has strong sexual 
undertones. 

The script is full of double- 
edged lines and the cast 
makes the most of them. 
After being pedantic and 
manic in "AlteredT^tes," ■

strong sense of humanity 
it, and shows that he is a fine 
actor. Hurt fits the romantic 
sensibilities of the role well, 
and makes a fine leading 
man. He makes the 
relationship believable. 

Stgourney Weaver, as 
Antonia Skoiow, shows a 
great gift for un- 
derstatement. She comes off 
as a cross between Jane 
Fonda and Katherine 
Hepburn, and has a talent for 
putting character 

development even in the 
smallest scene. 

Director Peter Yates 
handles the action with a 
tight pace, and never lets up. 
"Eyewitness" is as com- 
plicated as "Breaking 
Away" was simple. The film 
does get a little too com- 
plicated and bogged down in 
subplots, and diminishes the 
impact of the film. For 
ex&amp;mple, we never know 
why those Asian characters 
are lurking around the edges 
of the film, and the questions 
it raises are never fully 
answered. 



By DENNIS GKIGAR 
"You Must Believe in 
Spring," another beautiful, 
lyrical album of Bill Evans' 
music, is a love letter in nine 
segments from Evans to the 
world. 

There are few surprises, 
no synthesizers or 
fashionable, vocalized pop 
aimed at the post-disco 
condominium jazz listener, 
but rather a continuation of 
that subtle, introspective 
style that has become the 
trademark of this master 
musician. 

For over three decades, 
Evans graced the realm of 
jazz with an incredibly 
delicate, poignant artistry. 
Some die-hard fans would 
say that a ballad never 
reached fruition until it had 
been interpreted on Evans' 
piano, or sung by Biilie 
Holiday. Both artists are 
now beyond the cares of 
mankind, but each has left a 
wealth of recorded music for 



us to enjoy and remember 
them by. 

Conservatively speaking, 
there are more than 40 
Evans albums. If you don't 
own one yet, then "You Must 
Believe in Spring" is a good 
place to start. The Bill Evans 
Trio signature is complete 
herein. It includes excellent, 
often adventurous, bass 
work by Eddie Gomez and 
adequate drumming by Eliot 
Ztgmund. although Zigmund 
is not the most innovative of 
Evans' drummers, and that 
remarkably understated, 
melodic piano exploration. 

Though recorded in 1977 
( three years before his 
death), this album has just 
been released, leading me to 
believe there will be more 
Bill Evans music forth- 
coming. I hope so. There 
are evenings, or moods of the 
heart, that are best shared 
with friends. Bill Evans was 
a master musician, and a 
very compassionate friend.'

'Trotter's %$£ 
antics fill Ltk? 
coliseum 



By MIKE FRANKE 
Chief Reporter 

Everyone had seen it 
before. The tricks and slam 
dunks have become a 
trademark. But the people 
still show up in large num- 
bers to watch the world 
famous Harlem Globe- 
trotters dribble their 
magical basketball. 

The Globetrotters ap- 
peared at the Coliseum last 
Thursday night, and a good 
crowd turned out despite the 
current economic situation. 

Why do people pay money 
to see the same thing that the 
Globetrotters have been 
doing for the past 55 years? 
Team announcer Dave Stone 
says, "It's a great family 
program. To many of the 
people, especially the kids, 
it's like going to the circus." 

Stone is with the team all 
of the time. He travels with 
this National Unit from 
October 10 until the United 
State finale on April 10 at 
Notre Dame. That's when 
this edition of the 
Globetrotters packs up its 
gear and flies to Europe for a 
two and one half month tour 
The other Globetrotter team 
spends most of its time 
travelling throughout 
Europe. 

As you look over the 
crowd, all of the younger 
children are sitting on the 
edge of their seats an- 
ticipating another Globe- 
trotter antic, 

For the young children, 
seeing the Globetrotters in 
person is like watching a

frame that thes 



comic strip come lo life The 
team has had a cartoon 
program that ran all over the 
country on Saturday morn- 
ings. So for most kids, at 
least those who watch the 
cartoons, the Globetrotters 
are something lhat they can 
identify with. Stone added, 
"I think it really blows the 
kids' minds to see animation 
turn into reality." 

On this. night many of the 
famed Globetrotter trick 
shots were not going into the 
basket. It took Trotter 
veteran Curly Neal five shots 
until he finally connected on 
a "rainbow jumpshot" from 
the corner But nobody booed 
or hissed Commenting on 
that fact Stone said, "You 
don't want to boo your hero. 
These kids are awed by the 
presence of the Globetrot- 
ters." 

Is it because these guys 
aren't always in the right 



Spring sports to begin soon

out for the golf team should attend an organizational meeting 
at 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, March 17, in Room 112 of Walb 
Memorial. Anyone unable to attend this meeting should 
contact the Athletic Office no later than March 17, 1981.

Three make city's top ten 

Three of IPFW's Tuskers, Rickie Smith, Gary Rinard, and 
Brian Grady, are among the top scorers of the Fort Wayne 
city colleges. The colleges are IPFW, St. Francis, Fort 
Wayne Bible, and Indiana Tech. 

Smith was the number one scorer in the city with a total of 
604 points in 26 games, an average of 23.2 points per game. He 
was also the number one rebounder with 303 total rebounds, 
an average of 11. 7 rebounds per game 

Rinard holds seventh position in scoring with 351 points, an 
average of 14 points per game in 26 games With 5.7 rebounds 
per game, he is the fifth rebounder In the city. 

Grady is tenth in the city with 292 points, an average of 11 .2 
points in 26 games.

"No.. ..these guys have to 
give 100 percent every night. 
If they don't do their best the 
people won't come back and 
then these guys won't have a 
job with the Globetrotters." 

The traveling can 
sometimes get rough when 
the team plays six cities in 
seven nights. The squad 
travels by plane and bus, 
depending on the distance 
between trips, Stone said, 
"No matter which way we 
travel the accommodations 
are first rate. We're taken 
care of very well." 

For the Globetrotters the 
name of the game is en- 
tertainment, and keeping the 
fans happy for the entire 
game is their objective. The 
score isn't important even 
though the Trotters have

Tuskers bring 
home trophy 

By JENS M. SORENSEN 
Staff Writer 

No wizard can conjure up a potion to transform a losing 
team into a winner. But then coaches don't believe in magic 
anyway. 

Coaches believe in hard work. That, they know, is the 
"secret" of success. A large portion of hard work, mixed with 
constant improvement, good hustle, and some outstanding 
play in the clutch is the not-so-mysterious formula for 
making a winner. 

Coach Arnie Ball knew that prescription would help cure 
his volleyball team's 3-12 record — that and a few wins to 
restore his squad's confidence. 

The Tuskers' play in the Cincinnati Invitational last 
weekend was just what the good doctor ordered. Itworkedto 
the tune of five wins, a trophy, some good old-fashioned 
revenge and a bit of individual glory, as well. 

IPFW placed third in the 10-team tournament, finishing the 
weekend with a 5-1 record. That boosted the Tusker record to 
8-13 — only one win shy of last season's total — with 12 
matches and one tournament left to play. 

The Tuskers completed their pool play with a 4-0 record to 
advance to the semi-finals of the tournament. They then lost 
a close match to Tennessee, 15-13, 15-11 — an "excellent 
match" that Ball said could have gone either way. In the 
consolation malch for third place, IPFW downed Earlham in 
threesets, 15-13, 7-15, 15-8, to capture a trophy. 

In pool play, the Tuskers topped Allegheny College in 
straight sets; squeaked by Earlham, 15-13, 11-15, 16-14; beat 
North Carolina-Greensboro despite losing the first set; and 
avenged two losses to Notre Dame in the state tourney by 
easily handling the Fighting Irish in straight sets, 

IPFW trailed Earlham in the thirdset, 14-11, Ball said, but 
hung on to go up 15-14, and then won when Pat Menzie 
blocked a spike for the winning point. "He (Menzie) must 
have had a million blocks" in the two-day tournament, Ball 
said. 

Three of the matches went into three sets and the Tuskers 
won them all. "The kids played with as much emotion as they 
have played with all year," Ball said. 

Junior Paul Wyss was voted by the coaches to the six- 
player all-tournament team, Ball said. "Paul played ex- 
tremely well all during the tournament. I'll bet he hit a 
thousand balls," the coach said. Ball also cited the "great 
hustle of Colin Lelter" and the "much, much improved 
blocking of Pat Menzie " 

"It's kind of nice to win a couple," Ball said. "I enjoyed this 
weekend immensely." 

The Tuskers play at Toledo Saturday in a conference 
match. Toledo is in their first year in the conference. "We 
should win, but as soon as I say that we won't," Ball 
cautioned. 

On Wednesday, IPFW faces Ball State in a home match, 
but Ball does not foresee a win in the "cards." BSU has an 
old, established volleyball program, he said, and is fun- 
damentally sound. The Cardinals extended the powerful Ohio 
State team lo five sets in the championship game of the OSU 
Invitational earlier in theyear.
