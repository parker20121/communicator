Resorting to the Dollar Menu: How being poor affects your choices Op-Ed 



By Kelly McLendon 

kelly.mifcndoniaipfwco'nniunicslDr.Drg 

The fast food dollar menu is a good 
deal for your wallet, but not so good for 
yourwaistline or youroverall health. It's 
not just the fear of obesity that should 
concern you; tiiere's also the fright of 
sickness from infected foods to think 
about. 

Every day in the United States, 
200,000 people are sickened by a food 
borne disease, 900 are hospitalized 
and 14 die," according to the book 
"Fast Food Nation." Food borne illness 
caused by infected items served by fast 
food restaurants is easily preventable, if 
manufacturers faced more restrictions. 

The increase in food borne iUness 
is due to the way food is produced in 
America. 



"The nation's industrialized and 
centralized system of food processing 
has created a whole new sort of 
outbreak, one that can potentially 
sicken millions of people," Fast 
Food Nation says. "A modern factory 
designed for the mass producdon of 
food (has) instead become a vector for 
the spread of a deadly disease." 

It's not the local restaurant location 
that is dirty necessarily. It's primarily 
the manufacturer. To produce a 
large quantity of food at a low cost, 
the manufacturer has to make cuts 
somewhere. The first cut is usually 
with the nightiy cleaning service or 
sanitation costs. 

"Sanitation costs have an effect. 
Recent research by the USDA's 
Economic Research Service shows that 
sanitation and process control costs 



raised meat and poultry prices by about 
0.5 percent," according to The National 
Provisioner. 

Therefore, in order to save money in 
bad economic times, some companies 
may not be as stringent about 
cleaning. 

The meat and poultry plants are 
to blame for unsanitary conditions, 
too. A Preventive Medicine study 
found that chicken manure is often 
fed to cattle while they're waiting to be 
processed. The manure may contain 
salmonella and tapeworms, among 
other dangerous bacteria. 

Also, these pathogens are spread 
at the slaughterhouse directly. 
Knives aren't washed, the processing 
equipment is filthy, gloves become 
contaminated and sterilizers, ironically, 
aren't always that sterile. Plus, "a sing 



fast food hamburger now contains 
meat from dozens or even hundreds of 
different catde," Fast Food Nation said. 
With that much of a mixture, it is no 
wonder that what is used from one sick 
cow could end up making thousands of 
people sick. 

The right solution for many is not to 
stopeatingfast food. It'sconvenient and 
cheap; two things that are sometimes 
necessary in a fast-paced lifestyle. The 
solution is to choose the right fast food, 
however. 

Do some research and find out 
which foods are least likely -to be 
contaminated and try to order only 
those. Your health is worth it; jiobody 
wants to unnecessarily endure the 
painful symptoms of being infected 
with E. coli or Salmonella. 



United States of 

Facebook 

Users Part of the Change 



By Tom M otter 

onlaaeipfwcormiunicalnM; 



Facebook has be- 
come a household name, 
so much that when 
they made a recent at- 
tempt at changing their 
Terms of l/se agreement, 
it brought irriation to 
many users across the 
nation. The social new- 
tork's short lived change 
of their policy was an 
attempt at simplif^'ing 
the document. Facebook 
responded quickly and 
jusdy to their users con- 
cerns and immediately 
retracted the new Terms, 

Facebook's language 
created an even larger 
concern of how to keep 
users happy while fulfill- 
ing their goals as an open 
and transparent net- 
working site. Facebook's 
answer was to create a 
democratic opportunity 
for user's to voice their 
opinions on how Face- 
book is governed. 

Like the United 
States, Facebook has 
given its users two gov- 
erning documents. The 
first is Facebook Prin- 
ciples, which defines us- 
er's rights and will serve 
as a guiding document 
behind any policy Ihey 
accept or reject. Their 
second governing docu- 
ment is a Statement of 
Rights and Responsibili- 
ties which replaces their 
current Terms of Use. 

The similarity be- 
tween these two docu- 
ments and the US Bill of 
Rights and Constitution 
would give some the ap- 
pearance of a United 
States of Facebook. Witii 
these connections, Face- 



book extends the ability 
to vote for or against pro- 
posed changes to Face- 
book users. While Face- 
book was dealing with 
these changes in Terms 
of Use, most of America 
has been absorbing our 
change in government. 

"I would like vot- 
ing rights and would 
use them, " said IPFW 
husinss major, Melvia 
Siaten-Culpher. 

Facebook states that 
throughout history it is 
shoivn "systems are most 
fairly governed when 
there is an open and 
transpareni dialogue be- 
tween the people who 
make decisions and 
those who are affected 
by them". 

Still, die question at 
hand is will facebook's 
sense of democracy fiil- 
fill the needs of its us- 
ers while keeping the 
balance of an open and 
transparent networking 
community? 

"1 think it will make 
a lot more people 
happy,"says IPFW ac- 
counting and finance 
major, Jordan Keil. 

Some IPFW students 
like the idea of being 
able to vote on the gov- 
erning documents of a 
networking community 
that gives so much op- 
portunity for connection 
between people. With 
that opportunity come 
great responsibilities to 
give to its user's assur- 
ance of riglits, which in 
these two documents, 
Facebook users can give 
to themselves. 

"1 just don't put things 
on my page that may 
causeharmin the future," 
says Staten-Cupher.

Fort Wayne union workers dispute 
over laborers of new IPFW dorms 



By Katy Anderson 

Kattiryn .Anders on 
eiphvcoininunicator.org 

When driving past the 
IPFW dorms, one may 
have noticed a group of 
individuals holding signs 
saying things such as 
"Shame, shame on you, 
IPFW!" 

These protests are a 
result of a labor dispute 
between local union 
members and IPFW over 
the construction of the 
new dorms. 

According to Walt 
Branson, the IPFW Vice 
President of Financial 
Affairs, the dispute arose 
because the construction 
of the new dorms are not 
using all union labor but 
instead are using out-of- 
state laborers. 

The company select- 
ed for the project was 
MW Builders, Inc. and 
is based in Missouri. In 
the past, MW Builders 
was disputed against for 
bad workmanship and 
for not paying its work- 



ers appropnate wages. 
In some instances, these 
workers were non-legal 
citizens. 

The Lowest Respon- 
sible Bidder Act requires 
that institutions receiv- 
ing public hinds must 
select professional ser- 
vices thai are the lowest, 
most responsible, and 
most responsive bidder. 
If the board. responsible 
for choosing the service 
does not select tlie low- 
est bidder, they must 
state in their minutes or 
memoranda ihe factors 
they used to determine 
the ivinning bidder. In 
this instance, the Board 
of Members responsible 
for choosing the builders 
selected the iowesi bid- 
der. Hiring MW Builders 
resulted in a savings ol 
5127,000. 

According to union 
worker and affiliate of 
Carpenter's Local 232 
WUi Klein, the differ- 
ence could have been 
paid back in Fort Wayne 
in less than six months." 
This is because the proj- 



ect would have given 
morejobstoFortWayne's 

struggling economy if the 
jobs were given to work- 
ers from the state. - 

The construction of 
tlie new dorms will result 
in four new residential 
buildings, or 448 beds. 
The cost of the IPFW 
dorm project is an esti- 
mated S31.5 million. The 
profits made from this 



project will inevitably 
leave the state. 

"With the choice of 
general contractor that 
IPFW has chosen, fwhich 
had) past sub-contractor 
violations in past several 
states, and with the high 
unemployment rate of 
the people paying taxes 
for this project, we feel 
Purdue was not respon- 
sible in their selection 



of M.W. Builders," Klein 
said. 

Klein also states that 
the Fort Wayne union 
workers genuinely care 
about their community', 
including IPFW. 

He argues that many 
of the Fort Wayne union 
workers have sent or 
will send their children 
to IPFW, and it's unlike- 
ly that the out of state 



workers will be sending 
their sons and daughters 
to IPFW. 

This dispute will not 
be resolved anytime in 
the near fumre, as con- 
struction of the new 
dorms has commenced. 
Regardless, IPFW still 
respects and supports 
the union workers' first 
amendment rights.

IPFW students participate 
in Model UN conference 



By Katy Anderson 

KathrynJVndeuDne 
ipfwcommunicator.arg 

Between Feb. 18 and 
21, IPFW students and 
their faculty advisor 
attended a Midwest 
Model UN conference in 
St. Louis, Missouri. 

The Model UN is a 
simulation of the work 
of various bodies of the 
United Nations. Since 
the UN was founded in 
the 1940s, these models 
have been done at both 
the high school level and 
college level all around 
the world. This was the. 
second year IPFW has 



participated. The IPFW 
team was representing 
Sri Lanka this year. 

To prepare for 
the conference, team 
members met once a 
week for several weeks 
to have discussions and 
leam about Sri Lanka, its 
political and economic 
interests and UN 
procedures and issues. 

Once arriving at the 
conference, the goal of 
the teams was to produce 
resolutions that look like 
UN general assembly 
resolutions. 

The IPFW team 
was assigned to the 
general assembly and 



participated in four 
general committees of 
the general assemblies. 

Each country is 
engaged in a balance 
between defending their 
country's interests and 
the aggregated interests 
of the UN. Studenls 
negotiated for three days 
and created resolutions 
from scratch to the point 
where they' could get a 
majority vote and appeal 
to as many countries 
as possible. A lot of the 
work was done through 
informal caucusing and 
negotiation. 

Next year, IPFW will 
be representing Turkey

When he graduated from Central High School in 
Detroit, Michigan, Deilvez Yearby was on the fast 
track. He averaged a double-double of 21.4 points 
and 12.1 rebounds his senior year and was headed 
to Kansas State on a basketball scholarship. Life 
was good. 

Two years later, Yearby had played just 31 
minutes over 26 games. The school was anxiously 
awaiting their best recruitingclass, featuring current 
NBA players Michael Beasley and Bill Walker, and 
midway througli a coaching transition there just 
wasn't a place for Yearby anymore. 

There wasn't time for him in the lineup and for 
Yearby, that meant there no longer was an interest 
in being a Wildcat. 

"I had some ups and downs going through some 
coaching changes (at Kansas State) and here I was 
coming into a siluaiion where 1 had the opportunity 
to showcase my skills," Yearby said. 

Jim Wooldridge, the coach that recruited 
Yearby, was fired after the Michigan native's 
freshman year and replacement Bob Huggins 
leftai iheeinlnf hi-; 



sophomore campaign to take over at West Virginia. 

This is where Kansas State's loss became IPFW's 
gain. 

A gain that came thanks to several positives 
about Yearby. IPFW coach Dane Fife noted Yearby's 
size, athleticism, high major experience and strong 
character when asked about draws to Yearby. 

Once he was at IPFW and working for Fife on a 
daily basis, the four year IPFW head coach got the 
chance to see so much more. 

"The great thing about Deilvez is he can guard 
anyone on the floor," Fife said. "He definitely gives 
us versatility and a very different dynamic." 

The versatility is something that has helped 
IPFW in the lack of a traditional inside influence. 
In the Dane Fife Era, only 2008 graduate Jaraun 
Burrows has been used anywhere near the way of a 
traditional post player, as a pure physical presence. 
While IPFW's tivo biggest players Trey McCorkle 
and Igor Mocevic see limited time as they adjust 
to Division I play, Yearby has to be that guy who 
can score points 
around the basket 



and do a bulk portion of the rebounding. 

But his size and ability to play physical in the 
post does not limit Yearby, who is still athletic 
enough to run the floor well on defense and guard 
smaller,, quick players. 

"It's nice when he is out there because we can 
have five guards essentially. But he can still go on 
defense and guard their post player," Fife said. 

"It's very important that I can go out there and 
get mismatches," Yearby added. 

As seniors David Carson and I akari Johnson have 
taken their final tours and the team boasts nine first 
year Division 1 players, Yearby has taken on another 
role that his versatility has helped greatly with. He 
has become the stabilizing force, blending the 
older, experienced IPFW basketball with the firesh 
Mastodon basketball players who are trying to find 
their way. 

That siabilizing ability 
has allowed Yearby to come

the charm against Oaiciand

When coach Dane Fife's team 
opens their second Summit League 
Tournament this weekend, they will 
find themselves staring at an ail-too 
familiar foe. 

Standing in their way first will 
be the Oakland Grizzlies, a team 
who has beat IPFW twice, by five 
and 1 i points. Oakland is 2-0 when 
playing at neutral sites this season, 
as they will when they face IPFW 
at the home of South Dakota State. 
The Grizzlies are also riding a seven 
game winning streak. 

"Oakland's playing good 
basketball right now. but we've 
played them very competitvely in 
bolh games," Fife said. 

In the opening contest in Fort 
Wayne, IPFW neverled despite a 56- 
poinl second half The hot shooting 
of Eric Kangas kept IPIW always 
playing catch up despite cutting 
their deficit to three. Kangas scored 
a career high 39 in the game. 

In the second meeting between 
the Uvo, IPFW raUied back to take 
a second half lead on a big three- 
pointer by senior David Carson, but 
couldn't sustain it. 

"We've got to go in confident 
and prepared and if that happens, 
our guys can go into those tough 
cu'cumstances," Fife said. "There is 





DRIVE: Senior Jakari Johnson drives past Southern Utah's David 
Marek in Saturday's win. It was Johnson's first start of the year. 



a lot of pressure in that situation." 

The confidence starts witli the 
seniors, Carson and Jakari Johnson, 
who posted highs in Saturday's win. 
Johnson's defense will be crucial 
in matching up against the speedy 
Jonathan Jones. 

"They match up very tough 
inside vdth their height and also 
with quick guards like Jonathan 
Jones" Fife noted. 

In the first meeting of the teams, 



lones scored 20. In the second 
meeting, the Mastodons did well to 
slow down Kangas, but Jones took 
to the offensive in a different way 
by feeding the tall post players. 

Post players Keith Benson and 
Drew Maynard scored 24 and 13 
each, while Jones put a career high 
15 assists in the ll-point ivin in 
Rochester. 

The teams will face off Sunday 
at 9:30 in Sioux Falls.

UP anil IN: Chelsey Jackson had 
13 points in Saturday's win to 
clinch a spot for the women in 
the league tournament 



By Dan Vance 

dan.vance@lphvcommuntcdlDr.org 

A little over a month ago, a spot 
in the postseason was laughable 
at best. lanuarj' 24 came and went 
with another loss, the 17th of the 
season. 

On the other end, the IPFW 
women's basketball team were 
winners of just three and 1-7 
in Summit League play. Then 
something happened, something 
clicked. 

Two days later, Western Illinois 
came to town and IPFW played 
well, played consistent and pulled 
off a 55-51 win. Then, a trip to the 
Dakotas put them back into that 
place in the loss column previously 
reserved for die Mastodons. 

Then the Mastodons put the rest 
of the league in their place, winning 
sbcoftheirlast seven games, making 
them one of the three hottest teams 
going into the tournament next 
to tlie top two seeds. The fight for 
their seasonal life also restored a 
fire in the team tliat has been too 
long squelched. 

"We feel very good about what 
we're doing," coach Chris Paul 
said. "We are not going out to this 
tournament just to show up." 

While sophomore Chelsey 
Jackson has exploded in scoring, 
including 25 points in a 6B-48 



regular season closing blowout of 
UMKC, it has been the increased 
play of two seniors. Nan Moore and 
Tina Moen that has meant alot to 
the Mastodon push. 

"i can't say enough about those 
two seniors, " Paul said. "1 asked 
them both what happened and they 
said 'we just realised we are almost 
done and we don't want to go out 
playing the way we were.'" 

The l\vo seniors have led a 
physical charge on defense that 
has also translated over to give 
the Mastodons a different kind of 
offense than ihey relied on early in 
the season. 

"We changed our offense a little 
bit because we don't want to shoot 
all of the lime. There were games 
we were shooting 30 threes," Paul 
said. "We worked to get the ball 
inside to Eva Ivanova on the block 
and once teams had lo focus on 
her, it opened up our outside a little 
more." 

The evolving Mastodon offense 
will now lake them as the fifth seed 
to a meeting with 1UP0I. 

"It givesyouacertain confidence 
when you beat them a week ago," 
Paul noted. 

IPFW outlasted a tough Jaguar 
team 60-56 last weekend In 
Indianapolis, but lUPUI were 70- 
61 winners in Fort Wayne in late 
January. However, it is tlie rubber

Big second game rally cannot save Mastodons 

■ IPFW tripped up with conference loss in Muncie; team now prepares for four straight matches with West Coast foes 



IPFW visited Ball Slate last Friday in 
a critical conference match. Although 
the Mastodons fought hard, they ran 
out of steam near the end of the match 
and lost 3-0 (23-30, 34-36, 23-301. 

Freshman Phil Peterson led IPFW 
with 11 kills while Ben Duckworth 
totaled 10. Darryl Shank collected 
seven kills while Oliver Kook had sLx. 

Kook also had a match high of six 
blocks. Shank played aggresively with 
seven digs and four blocks. 

Despite IPFVV getting on the board 
first, IPFW looked a bit sluggish in the 
first game. Ball State jumped out front 
with solid blocking from the get-go. 
forcing coach Arnie Ball to call a time 
out at 13-7. IPFW didn't let that gel to 
them and kept fighting, bringing the 
score back to within three. 

After a tough first set. IPFW came 

and played more cohesively, having 

made some adjustments, but the 

Cardinals' Marcus Imvvalle came out 

g wfith 15 kills. The teams stayed neck 



and neck most of the second set, ivith 
the largest margin of tlie game going 
to IPFW by four. BSU didn't take the 
lead until the 30 point mark when they 
went up 31-30. IPFW kept it close, but 
ultimately lost the set, 36-34. 

In the third set, the Mastodons kept 
things close eariy on but eventually 
ran out of sieam. They pulled away at 
20-18, and never recovered losing the 
third set 30-23.

5 things I think about basketball's closing week 



In All Directions - opEd 

By Dan Vance 

vance-iad.blQgsptH.com - 

The world's most illogical tiebreaker 

1 think that first of all. 1 have to apologize for an 
error that appeared in a slory 1 wrote for last week's 
issue regarding the seeding in ihe men's basketball 
Summit League Tournament. 

Yes everything I said would have to happen did 
for IPFW to earn the fifth seed in the conference 
tournament. What I did not lake into account was 
the fact tliat the tiebreaker procedure of the Summit 
League is pretty rediculous. 

Here is the explanation, so we are all clear: section 
A of the procedure says that the initial tie-breaker is 
head-to-head competition, where IPHVand Southern 
Utah (both 8-10 in conference) split games against 
eachother. However, head-io-head competition only 
includes a win/loss scenerio and does not take into 
consideration the scoring margin of the two games 
(IPFW +1). Not only is that not clearly stated in the 
league's procedure, buipretty much every sporting tie 
in the world is decided by head-to-head competition 
and includes the consideration of scoring margin. 

But this is the Summit League and well, when have 
they ever made much sense? Instead, the procedure 
is pushed to section B, where Southern Utah gets the 
nod because they beat North Dakota Stale, the top 
seed. IPFW only, at best, beat the number-two seed. 

Great ideaSununit League, let's decide this with an 
irrelevant game against a third party. I'd understand 
moving to section B if the scoring margin was equal. 
But if Southern Utah beat IPFW by 16 and IPFW beat 
Southern Utah by 17. doesn't that mean that IPFW is 
statistically better than the Thunderbirds? Maybe I'm 
jiist being logical. 



Ball meet front row. Front row meet ball 

1 think that with 12:54 remaining in Saturday's 
contest, junior Deilvez Yearby sent one of the sickest 
blocks I have ever seen sailing over the heads of the 
Southern Utah coaches into the front roiv of fans, 
roughly 35 feet from where his hand made contact 
with the ball. 

As impressiveas the block was. so ivas the record it 
tied. Tiie rejection wasVearby's 54 th ofthe year, tying 
a beastly record by Mastodon great David Simon. 

Perfect time to peak 

I think that senior Nan Moore has picked the right 
time to peak. She has played in 28 of 29 games this 
year, but only started four for the women. Those four 
have been the last four. 

The team has won all four games she has started 
" and solid efforts led up to Saturday's performance. 
Moore scored eight points, stole the ball twice and 
was clutch on defense. But even better, Moore pulled 
down a career high U rebounds, which was also a 
team and game high number. 

Jakari vs. Bakarl 

1 think this may be the most inconsequential 
thing in the past week of clutch basketball moments 
for IPFW. But, am 1 the only one tliat enjoyed last 
Thursday's matchup of IPFW's lakari Johnson 
and UMKC's Bakari Leivis? The UMKC team was 
interesting from top to bottom with unique names 
and a pair of Fort Wayne natives (still dissapointed 
that Fred Ford was not in uniform), bdt seriously- 
lakari and Bakari? What are the odds of tliat? It sounds 
like a strange Caribbean alcoholic beverage. 

Best of the Division I era 

I think winning must feel good for both teams. 




Photo by Monka Gerdeman 

PERSONAL BEST: Senior Nan Moore grabbed a 
career best 1 1 rebounds against Southern Utah 

The men tied their Division 1 record for ivins in a 
season with 13 and the women won sut of their final 
seven games. The last time IPFW women had a better 
finish was the 2000-2001 season.

Youtheatre Presents 
Charlotte's Web 

By Louisa Danielson 

loulM.dinidicinaipfwionimunlcatar.arg 




pg. 10 

Artist of the Week: 

n 



Peter Rumsey is a ham in the truest sense of the 
word. From fainting at the thought of being sold lo 
capering about the barnyard or dodging Hornet 
Zuckerman and the rest of the fann folk, Wilbur 
the Pig. played by Petet Rumsey, was a star in the 
February 13th Fort Wayne Youtheatre presentation of 
"Charlotte's Web." 

The original children's tale, written by E,B. White, 
is about a young pig named Wilbur, who is rescued 
from an untimely death as a runt. Wilbur is adopted 
by Fem. the farmer's daughter, sold to Homer 
Zuckerman's farm, and eventually befriends the 
whole barnyard of animals. 

The Youtheatre production followed the original 
story fairly closely. With charming 1950's costumes 
and a fantastic set. Director Harvey Cocks put on one 
of the best productions the Youtheatre has had in a 
longtime. 

As the stor&gt;' unfolded, lohn Arable (Alex 
Hockenberry) carefully weighted the pros and cons of 
letting his daughter, Fem {Annie Rumsey), raise a pig, 
eventually deciding in her favor. Not to be outdone, 
Fern's brodier, Avery (Nick Graber), asks for a pig 
loo, but is told.that he got up too late to do any civic 
service for the day. 

Wilbur is later sold to Homer Zuckerman, the 
farmer who lives down the road from the Arables, In 
the Youthcaire's rendition of the sior&gt;', Wilbur meets 
the Goose, the Gander, the Old Sheep, the Lamb, and 
Templeton the Rat. The Goose (Alaina Richert) had 
a tendency' lo reiterate words, which initially threw 
Wilbur until the Gander (Colby Shoup) whispered, 
"We like to repeat, repeat, repeat ourselves." 

Life is lovely at the Zuckerman farm, until Wilbur 
panics at the thought of becoming breakfast food. 



Then comes Charlotte to the rescue. Gracefully 
performed by Kailee Blaettner, Chariotte is the spider 
who lives in the dooryard of the old barn where 
Wilbur's home is. She assures Wilbur tliat she will 
save his life, and comes up with a plan that stuns 
Zuckerman. 

In die morning, just as farmhand Lurvy is about to 
feed t!ie pig, he notices something funny in the spider 
web above Wilbur. Into the web are woven the words 
"Some Pig". Lurvy runs to alert the Zuckermans and 
the news spreads of this 'miracle'. 

Wilbur becomes a celebrity sensation. Subsequent 
words appear in the web, including 'Terrific' and 
'Humble'. HomerZuckermanisso impressed with his 
pig that he lakes him to the county fair and promises 
that if the pig is the blue-ribbon winner, Wilbur will 
never be turned into bacon. 

Wilbur makes it to the fair, survives a buttermilk 
bath, and wins the red ribbon. He is also given a 
special bronze medal and the Zuckerman's receive 
a cash award for having such a unique pig. Wilbur's 
longevity is assured. 

Unfortunately. Charlotte dies after weaving 
one last web at the fair. Soft, Chopin-esque piano 
music trickled over the auditorium as the choruses 
announced that Charlotte "never moved from her 
web." Asa lasting tribute to her memory, Wilburasked 
Templeton the Rat IDuncan Smith) for one last favor. 

"Til the next one," Templeton grumbled, rescuing 
Chariotte's egg sack from its high perch in the rafters. 

The play closed with the last line stating, "It is not 
often that you have a true friend who is also a good 
ivriter." Saint-Saens' music from the Carnival of the 
Animals sounded as all the actors came onstage for 
one last bow. Especially loud applauses met Wilbur 
and Chariotte as they took their bow. 




Watchmen 

If Kanye Likes It, So Do I 



By Devin MJddleton

The days near closer to 
the average nerd's comic 
book event of a lifetime. 
No, not mom's weekly 
allowance. I'm talking 
about Watchmen. The 
epic graphic novel ' is 
days away from its movie 
release. The anticipation 



is so high, even Kanye 
West has shown interest 
on his blog, and if Kanye 
West likes it, so do I. Af- 
ter a few conversations 
with fellow comic book 
nerds, I've gotten a sense 
of worry. Comic books 
that are made into mov- 
ies aren't as exciting as 
Ihcy used to be. Sure, it 
started off good in the 
beginning; some flashy 



Batman movies here and 
there or a classic Super- 
man film. I tliink we all 
know that comic book 
movies went down the 
hill starting with Spider- 
man 3. You takeoneof the 
best villians in the whole 
spiderman universe, and 
you get Eric Forman to 
take an epic comic book 
poop on its entire lega- 
cy. There are only going 
to be more comic book 
movies, but Watchmen 
isn't just another comic 
book. It's fancy enough 
to earn the title of graph- 



ic novel. My prediction 
is that Watchmen will be 
everything Mystery Men 
wasn't, and if you don't 
remember that movie at 
all, then i think that says 
something good about 
the Watchmen film. Al- 
though anticipation is 
high, there have been 
reports of nerds burn- 
ing down Hollywood if 
it doesnt live up to the 
hype. I don't know about 
you, but as long as they 
don't hurt my precious 
lessica Alba, i'm perfectly 
fine with thai. 



Roommate's Pick: Yellow Second 



By Mark Cox 



Wellifitisn'tYellow- 
card. Wait, it isn't? Oh. 
These guys are Yellow 
Second — an indie pow- 
erpop machine — and 
are a broken up band 
from Denver, Colorado 
I that was formed in 1999 
by Scott Kerr and An- 
drew Verdecchio from 
the ska band Five Iron 
Frenzy. The band had a 
six-year stretch before 
their split and released 
three albums and many 
otherunreleasedtracks, 
which were made avail- 
able for dovmload boxn 



their official website. 
YellowSecond'sdisband- 
ment was announced via 
theirofficial MySpacc ac- 
count in late 2005. 

Scott Kerr, Yellow 
Second's foreman, stated 
that his end goal in form- 
ing the band was "ivrit- 
ing good songs which 
are musically interesting 
but also accessible." His 
inspirations are personal 
fails, romance, and allu- 
sions to the writing pro- 
cess. Altitude was theonly 
Yellow Second album to 
receive distribution vj;t 
a major label, making it 
the band's most prevn- 
lent and widely known 
album. ■ 



Tile band sounds 
similar to a mix ofWee- 
zer, Tile Posies, and Yel- 
lowcatd. They brouglit 
a great sound into the 
industry and it's disap- 
pointing that they broke 
up. 

They could have done 
a lot more with the band 
seeingas they loured with 



bands such as Relient K, 
TheRocketSunimerand 
Something Corporate. 
My favorite songs off 
their album Altitude are 
"Silhouette" and "Mul- 
berry." Check them out 
on MySpace and tutie 
in March 18 when The 
Communicator returns 
for Roommate's Pick.

He stands tall before 
the ensemble, adorned in 
a black and white tuxedo. 
A musical score lays on 
the stand in front of him, 
the entire sheet notarized 
and tailored to fit his 
original amalgamation 
of tones and harmonies. 
David lifts his arms, a 
baton in his right hand, 
and begins. 

David Eisenhauer 
is a sophomore Music 
Education major, and 
Theatre minor, at IPFW. 
He is also a member of 
the Heartland Chamber 
Chorale. Although David 
has always loved music, 
his appreciation for it 
truly matured during his 
sophomore year of high 
school. 

When he was cast 
in the New Haven High 
School's performance 
of "My Fair Lady" as 
tiie character Henry 
Higgins, "It was the 
first big role I've ever 
gotten." Eisenhauer said. 
"Working personally with 
the musical and theatre 
directors was pinnacle 
forme. It's what got into 
music education." 

Before ■ David had 
heard his calling to 
become an educator and 
also, he- wanted to be a 
Broadway actor. That 
early pillar was soon 
side stepped when he 
realized how unstabli- 



the life of an actor is, 
before one "makes it" in 
the business. 

David isn't waiting 
lo begin his life as an 
educator until after 
graduation, in ^ct he 
currently assistant 

teaches a choir class .at 
Snider High School. After 
graduating from IPFW he 
plans on becoming a full 
time teacher, and work 
on his graduate degree 
in conducting. David is 
continuously searching 
for the right grad. School 
for him, and right now 
his prospects are on lU 
Bloominglon. 

Inspiration surrounds 
David, in the fomi of 
his family and fticnds. 
Both of his patents ate 
influential role models 
for him, as well as, his 
"better hair Courtney. 

Tiie one inspiration 
who motivates him 
the most is his late 
aunt Marilyn, whom 
he was never able to 
meet because of cancer. 
David says she was the 
performer of the family. 
on his mother's side. 

But at the end of the 
day. as he taps away 
on his piano keys, it is 
music that is life force 
that animates David 
Eisenhauer.

K'NAAN 



t^_ GdMMfJlIlGiSf dR 



By Dan Vance 

lanceeipfwconirnunicoto 



At this point, il is pretty rare 
for any music to jusi catch my 
atlenlion at random, especial- 
ly in the world of hip-hop. The 
hip -hop cuJtiire has changed 
mostly for the bad, but an art- 
ist like K'naan can change that 
presumption very quickly. 

This is an artist who isn't 
afraid to blend genres and styles 
into unexpected new combina- 
tions, and does so with great 
form on Troubadour, his sec- 
ond studio album. 

Even better, K'naan diversi- 
fies his featured anist ponfolio 
to include Damien Marley, Ma- 
roon 5's Adam Levine and Me- 
tallica's Kirk Hammet, among 
others. 

Maybe hip-hop isn't even 
the correct term to use. After 
all, to pigeonhole an artist like the 
Somalia-bom K'naan into a spe- 
cific genre defeats the purpose of 
the eclectic music that he makes. 
Instead, he has a smooth world 
music that sounds like a strange 
mash up of Eminem, Wyclef John 
and John Legend with a strong 



depth and profound message to 
his lyrics. 

The best example of the differ- 
ent vibes is in the song "Wavin' 
Flag," where he starts out with 
brief acapella vocals and moves 
into a reggae -like pmse. This song 
also carries my favorite line of the 




album when K'naan proclaims, 
"look how they treat us, make us 
believers...we fight their battles, 
then they deceive us." 

Another strong track on the 
disc is "Take a Minute," K'naan's 
anthem of the need for relaxation 
and thankfulness. 

Again, the combination of hip- 



hop infused vocals and that John 
Legend-like R&amp;B make the mes- 
sage of this song that much more 
potent. 

Catching you even more off 
guard is the Mos Def and Chali 
2Na featured track "America." 
The instrumenials start with a 
jazz vibe that transition amaz- 
ingly into a traditional African 
music style. K'naan himself 
gives you two different vibes 
with his more reggae-like ef- 
fort muted with lyrics in his 
native tongue of Somali. 

The unique voices of 
Mos Def and Chali 2Na, who 
sounds oddly like James Earl 
Jones, give this track so many 
levels that would usually just 
clog a track up. 

Fortunately for K'naan, 
there is nothing lost in "Amer- 
ica," especially when he gives 
one of the most honest lines 
period, "I got my own sound, 1 
don't sound like the rest." 

K'naan is right uith that lyric 
and I for one am thankful that 
he prides himself on not sound- 
ing like any other music. Future 
star or not, the music industry is 
lucky to have unique artists like 
K'naan.

Hardcore Rock Comes to Sunset Hall 

Haste the Day, In the Face of War, 
Sound the Messenger &amp; Skunkape Hysteria 




By Hana Hawash 

h.ina.tiawaih^iplwcainmuniuior.arg 

Since 2001, Haste 
The Day has sold over 
200,000 albums and 
has played various 
shows all over America 
including Warped Tour. 
On February 22, Haste 
The Day and three other 
bands played a show at 
Sunset Hall on the south 
side of Fort Wayne that 
rocked ilsaudience shoes 
off- literally. 

Moshing seemed to 
be the main event, other 
than the music itself of 
course. Moshing is a 
term used to describe 
what is basically a group 
of people pushing and 
jumping on each other 
in a more than rough 
manner. If you are 
tempted to try moshing 
but are like me and a little 
intimidated by six foot 
tall guys beating on each 



other, remember that 
there still are gendeman 
who will do their best to 
make sure that you do 
not get thrown to the 
floor and trampled. 

Theoveralleffectofthe
