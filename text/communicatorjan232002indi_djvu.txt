■r We jusi can't Hjcm to gtt enough. Il is only natural that the 
s media would pick up on this obvious trait and use it as a mar- 
kctinc toot to gam viewer? ot itjders 

However, when the media uses eiplicil content without having 
purpose or equally ^iKnificanl information to analyze and back up 
lat content, Ihey are underesli mating the intelligence and concern of 
the public who are walchinc and reading. This can lead to a break- 
down of the (rust and crcdioilily that .ite necessary for the survival 
of news staliuns and newspapers. 

In the past, controversial material in the media has served a pos- 

^e purpose. Two hundred ye.irs ago. it was indecent lor a woman 

show her ankles in puMit Frank, sexual language and content 

•K appalling and unlhinkablc. The media has helped to change the 

moral standards ol our society by challenging society's rules of 

iccep lability. 

Before the 1920s, women did not shave their underarm hair. It 
vas seen as natural and a pat! of the female body. Then one maga- 
:ine printed a picture oF j woman without underarm hair The pub* 
ic was shocked and apn.illed hy the photograph. Now vie arc more 
ippalledby a picture of lulia !&lt;oberls showing off her unshaved pits. 
The use of powerful im,igi-s and l.inguage can also alert the pub- 
ic lo many social injuslicc^^. In [9')2, the American public was 
hocked by images ol Rodnty King being bealen by police ofiicers 
ind the riols thai soon followed. These images were important 
tiecau.se they woke up the American people and enlightened them of 
lOCial problems ol tatisni, police brutalily and poverty. 
When shocking m.ilLThjl i'- u-j.'d .is a tool to iriform. reform and 
:ale, its significance aril (iri'&gt;ence is positive and necessary'. 
However, when conlroviTsi,ii m.iiLri.il l^ used as a way fora joumal- 
t to gain viewers or [c.iiIlts, Ui j;el aliiiition or lo disguise a lack of 
ull ur purposi', it is IruK jn unJtrli.iniled and offensive tactic. 

Eiplicil Liiiguajje ,in,i c.'mIi.h ut-ijI images are a good market-

much easier lo eliijit an emctuinal response Irom peopli 
than it is to make them thmk. One example involves Ihe footage ol 
the planes smashing into the Twin Towers. The media really did not 
have much information lo give us at the time. So. in order to Till their 
segments and hold our attention, they aired Ihe same footage over 

In fact, one maior news network included the footage an then 
website. One was able to pause, rewind and replay the exact moment 
of contact repeatedly, if desired. Sorry kiddies, no slow motion. That 
would havebeen in poor taste. 

The Clinlon sex scandal was a journalist's dream assignment 
Sex, lies, betrayal — my goodness, how could Ihey lose? Never mind 
Ihe fact that more important issues were being ignored. Never mind 
that the evening news had turned into a supermarket tabloid. 

Perhaps the members ol the media are right in their mentality. 
Maybe we are a society made up of bloodthirsty, scandal-loving 
voyeurs. Maybe it does take shocking material to gain public alien 
lion. Whatever the public opinion may be, it is obvious thai 
Hollywood has left a mark on modem-day journalism. 

It seerru that people don't want to be enlightened anymore — 
they want to be entertained. After coming home from a long, 
ful day at work, most people arc seeking bubble gum for theb 
nothing too deep or thought provoking. They want dislracliorw from 
the pressures of real life. 

However, the job ol the news media is r 
inform, educate and make people think. People watch CNN and read 
newspapers to get information. Leave the sensationali- ■- ■"- - 
tabloids and sitcoms. 

Newspapers are even more attraclcd to scandal and 
sy as a marketing ploy because people don't like lo read anymore, 
either. If people don't like to read and prefer lo be spoon-fed, then 
joumalisls had better find a way to appeal to our need to be enter- 
tained or people won't even bother to pick up the paper anymore. 

You, Ihe public, need tobeawareof what is really going an here. 
Perhaps 1 am Just young and naive to believe that the majority ol Ihe 
American people are above needing lo have news, ideas and opin- 
ions diluted by sex, scandal and sensationalism. 

Just keep your eyes open. Recogiuze the difference bclween elic- 
it conteni that serves a puipose and sexy scandal that gels your atlen- 
lion while insulline your intelligence. 

If readers and viewers demand a higher quality product and 
greater journalistic integrity from the media, they will be forced to 
respond.

Leadership and morals 









From the 
Right 

Nathan Olehi, 
Staff Columnist 


Si 





It was just over a year ago when the United 
States finally purged itself of Bill Clinlon and ushered 
in George W. Bi^sh. 

It vvasn't without question, though, as Al Gore 
tried repeatedly to i»-inierprei the United States 
Constitution (since he believes it is a living, breathing 
document] to his eiery whim and desire. 

He demanded a recount and still lost. 

He then demanded a recount of the recouni 
still tost the election. 

Since that time, although you probably have not 
heard, an independent and bipnitisan recount of bal- 
lots in the slate of Florida has been compiled. 

The ballols were tabulated using three separate 
interpretations (dimples or no dimples, etc.) and 
PresidentBushgainedeither 116. 107 or 116 votes. 

Bush won Florida and llieir electoral votes. End 

When 1 think about Ihe United Stales and every- 
thing we've gone throuj^ the past four months. 1 am 
thankful thai Core wasn't able lo reinterpret Ihe 
Corulitution to his own gain. 

tn limes of crisis, the United States needs leadets 

are able lo stand up and bring people together, 
such as Bush and former New York mayor, Rudolph 
GulHani. 

I would nol want lo falltom where the United 
States would be today if nol for the leadership abili- 
ties of Bush and Guilianl. 

Leadership does not mean changing and redefin- 
ing the things you want ('sexual relations,' the 
Corutitulion), but rather, leadership means bringing 
the American people stability we can count on— no 
mailer what has happened and no mailer what Ihe 
topic Dtay be. 

Bush doesn't wavet; he says what he thinks and 
isn't apologetic about it. He doesn't cliange his mind 
on this or that lo gel his way. 

He is willing to give a little to get a little and he 
is a true centralist politician who is not afraid to Stand 
up to his own party and tell it like he s«s it. ■ - ■ 

Bush provides not only the leadership the United 
States has lacked in recent ye.irs, but also brings true 
morals into the While House once again. 



What we should remember on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day- 
Judge people by their character, not skin color 



iVhal should we remember on Martin Luther 
King Jr. Day? In his "I Have a Dream" speech, 
King said: "I have a dream that my four children 
will one day live in a nation where Ihey will not be 
judged by the color of their skin, but by the con- 
tent of their character." 

This statement, made bclore King became an 
advocate of "bbck power," means thai in judging 
other men, skin color should be ignored— that it 
should nol be a (actor in evaluating their compe- 
tence or moral statute. It lollow? that skin color 
should nol be a (arlor in taking actions toward 
other people, i.e. hiring and jdmitting lo universi- 



pensaie a second group lo correct injustices 
caused by a third group who mistreated a fourth 
group at an earlier point in history (i.e. I860) is 
absurd and docs nol promote justice; rather, it 
does the opposite. It promotes racism, 'i'ou caimot 
cure racism with more racism. Singling out one 
group for special favors (through affirmative 
action) ignores the fact thai people are individu- 
als — nol interchangeable ciphers in an amorphous

men aue lo a quirky bias on Ihe part of its founder. 
The founder now dies and an enlightened board 
of directors decides that something "positive" 
needs to be done to compensate for past injustices 
and announces that, henceforth, redheads ivill be 
hired on a preferential basis. 

Observe Ihat: 1) this does not help Ihe real 
victtms— Ihe previously excluded redheads; 2) the 
newly favored redheads have nol been victims of 
discrimmation ui hinng, yet unfairly benefit from 



it and 3) Ihe nan-redheads who are now excluded 
from jobs due lo Ihe redhead preference did not 
cause the previous discrimination and are now 
unfairly made viclirns of it. The proper solution, 
of course, is simply to slop discnminating based 
on irrelevant factors. Although redheaded bias is 
not a social problem, the principle remairu the 
same when you replace hair colorwilh skin color. 

The traditional solution to Ihe problem of 
racism is colorblindness or. from Ihe other side of 
that coin, individual awareness. For example, in 
the job sphere, there are orUy three essential things 
an employer needs to know about an individual 
applicant: I) Does the person have the relevant 
ability and knowledge &lt;or the cap,icily to Icam 
readily)? 2) Is thepersonwillingtoexert the need- 
ed effort? 3) Docs the person have good character, 
i.e. honesty, integrity?

ishcs possessed by each individual. Americans 
should abhor racism, in any form, for the same 

On Martin Luther King Jr. Day — and every 
day— we should locus on the proper antidote lo 
racism and the proper allcrnative to racial think-

Singer Lou Rawls plays to a full 
house at the Embassy Centre. 

According to Captain Dave Phillips of the 
FWFD's Fire Code Enforcement Division, 
appiovimalcly 1600 lans filled the seals al Ihe 
former Emboyd, now Embassy Thcalrc on Jan. 
18 to witness singer Lou Rawis' opening lughl 
in Fort Wayne. 

Maestro Edvard Tchiv/hcl conducted the 
philharmonic in the first part of the evening. 
The first number was "Overture lo Candide" 
by Lconand Berslein. composer of "Wesl Side 
Slory." Following was a lune called "The 
Liberty Bell March." Ihal is yel another sel of 
bars and measures paying Iribule to America, 
composed by United States Marine Corps Band 
legend John Phillips Sousa. A medley of 
Gershwin's "Porgy and Bess" delighted audi- 
ences until intermission lime. 

Fillecn minutes later, Ihe audience 
returned for more. As Ihe lighls dimmed and 



the spollighl came up. entering stage 
righl was Ihe man of Ihe evening 
himself, Rawls The band starled 
playmg and he starled to sing such 
hits as "Groovy People." "Tobacco 
Road" and Rawls' signature lime. 
"Lady Love," 

Nol only did Rawls emil the 
sounds of his own original work, he 
showcased Ihe sounds of voices from 
Ihe past, covering such artists as 
Sam Cooke, The Spaniels, Nat King 
Cole, "Satchmo" Louis Armstrong's 
■'Whal a Wonderful World" 
and Sondheim's classic, "Send in 
the Clowns," 

Perhaps one of Ihe more mem- 
orable moments oi the performance occurred 
when Rawls took Ihe last (ew verses of "What a 
Wonderful World" and emulated the sound of 
the ever-present frog in Armstrong's throat. II 
was a nice way lo pay Iribule to one of the first 
great black American music entertainers. 

J enjoyed Ihe whole of Ihe evening and 
feel thai Rawls is nol only a singer of talent, 
bul an cnterlainer, as well. 

When I saw Pete Fountain al the Embassy 
a few years ago, 1 was nol impressed. While 
Fountain is a (vonderful musician, he wasn't an 
enthralling performer. He (ailed lo recognize 
the audience. 

Rawls is a singer and an entertainer. 
Between trying to hit various noles on the 
scales. Rawls was challing wilh Ihe audience, 
telling jokes or relating anecdotes, 

Rawls and his band— Jeff Colella, piano 
and conductors; Ken EUiol, drums; Curtis 
Robertson. Jr., bass; David T Walker, guitar; 
and Billy Hulling, percussion— made Ihe 
everung at the Embassy Centre a memorable 
performance.

tlie students are forced to deal

hood values and tax revenues. 

Other forms of energy may be 
cleaner, but more expensive. 

The software forces students 
to pay for their energy policies 
within a balanced budget. 

Specilically. this year's essay 
requires students to explain how 
they researched and explored 



energy sources; how they 
designed the city's energy plan
