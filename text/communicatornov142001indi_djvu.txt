Education students who 
attended a Nov, 6 forum featur- 
ing a panel of Allen Counly 
school district administrators 
learned thai job prospects in 
the counly look very promis- 
ing. 

This year alone, the four 
school distrids in Allen Counly — 
Fort Wayne Community, 
Northwest Allen. East Allen 
and Southwest Allen County 
Schools — hired nearly 320 
new teachers at their rcspeclive 

Despite Ihc promising num- 
bers, however, the job market 
for teaching slill is intensely 
competitive, said panelist Phil 
Kurtz. Executive Director of 
Operations at EACS. 

"Every job you look at, you 
will be competing for," he said. 



'This year, foi 

four opening . . . _. 

lary school level and 100 candi 



had 






dates for those positions." 

The panel also included 
Nancy Schram, FWCS manager 
of hiring, placement and reten- 
tion; Phyllis Davis, human 
resource manager from SWACS 
and Steven 'leager, supcrin- 
tendenl of NWACS. 

Bach panelist took the lime 
to tell students how they could 
effectively compete against a 
large number of candidates for 
a small pool of available )obs. 

The panelists described their 
respective school distrids and 
detailed how they hired new 
teachers, what they looked for 
in candidates and what curric- 
ula were particularly in need of 
instructors. 

In discussing how candi- 
dates could increase their 
chances of landing a job, all 
agreed that substitute teaching 
was one of the best ways a stu- 
dent planning to teach could 
get his foot in the door. 

"Subbing helps us and it 



"We encourage subbing so 
that we can observe you." 
Davis said. 

The panelists each said that 
school principals, though not 
the final decision makers, had a 
lot of say over which candi- 
dates were hired. 

Kurtz said principals in his 
district often recommend cer- 
tain substitutes for him to hire. 

Math, science and special 
education Icachers are particu- 
larly difficult positions to fill. 

Schram said thai at RVCS, 
the largest district in the coun- 
ty, the need for teachers of 
English as a second language. 
because of an "explosion" of 
ESL students, has been increas- 
ing each year. 

Schram said that although 
FWCS hires teachers to fill 



posii 



"all 



the 



board," il is currently in need 
of hiring elementary school 
teachers- 
She said FWCS is slill look- 
ing lo fill 15 vacant leaching 
positions in its dislricl. 

Schram said thai FWCS, 
which is Ihe largest employer 
in Allen County, has a "tremen- 
dous variety of teachers, par- 
ents and children in our dis- 
trict." 

She said that mosi of Ihe 53 
schools in the district specialize 
in a particular area of study, 

Schram added. "We're the 
type of district where, if you 
like change, we are for you." 

FWCS also focuses on diver- 
sity, she said. Teachers have to 
go through diversity training 
before they begin. 

To better reflect the student 
population in FWCS, Schram 
said she was looking to hire 
more minority teachers. 

She said, however, that some 
of the most important trails a 



Erospective applicant could 
ave was "an understanding of 
what it means to be an effective 
leacher," a "tremendous under- 
standing ol specific subject 
matter" and a belief that all stu- 
dents can graduate. 

Davis said that EACS is 
looking for candidates who are 
willing to collaborate with 
olher teachers to help belter 
educate students and those 
with computer technology 

She said EACS is currently 
involved in a larger project to 
teach computer skills lo teacli- 
ers (hat go bevond just using 
the computer lor record keep-

FinI oil. I would like to sI:iIl' rtui I am in no 
way cicn slightly homophobic. I have close 
Iriends Ihjl arv bisexual, and this doesn't bolher 
me in Ihc itighlest. However, on the froni page of 
the October 31 lisue of your newspaper. Ihere is a 
large fejlure piclura of four "Drag Queens" Irom 
Ihe United Sexualiljw event held al the Walb 
Union Ballioom on Oct. 28. I did not attend this 
event, nor am I familiar with Ihe happening of 
Ihis group or olher "sexual I ties' groups on cam- 

I would simply like lo slate thai I And it 
offensive thai this is jusi one ol many stories thai 
could have been covered Ihis week. As I slated 
earlier, I do not have a problem with homosexual 
or bisexual people; most of Ihem are very nice, as 
ate the rest of me general populalion. Whal I do 
have a problem wilh is Ihe fact thai Ihis is a uni- 
vetsily, and is supposed to be centered around 
academics and learning. With so many activities. 
clubs and guest speakers happening on a weekly 
basis, is Ihis the besi storj' you could find to fea- 
lure on the FRONT PAGE7The p.iper appeara to 
be favoring one croup. Being bisexual or homo- 
sexual doesn't give anyone extra rights; it is a 
choice that people make. I have spoken wilh 
many of my friends and classmates on campus 
about Ihis issue, and most of them have Ihe same 
opinion. 

Whal 1 would like lo see from The 
Communicator is Ihe paper lo show a little more 
consideration (or all sectors o I Ihe general public. 
Alter all, Ihc only readers who really care about 
this recent event were probably in allendance 
that night'

From the 
Right 



'Getting some' 

and true 

happiness 

A dating rebtioixship means nuny dif- 
ferent things to many different people. To 
some, a dating rcblionship is all about 
physical attraction and touch. To them, it's 
about gelling some' or 'scoring.' To others, 
a dating relationship is much more than 
merely 'getting some' 
opment of a rela- 
tionship. 

College males 
are often stereo- 
typed as caring 
about dating only to 
get some play and 
to score. To him. it's 
all about doing wJiat 
has to be done lo 
score, and nothing 
more. It's about fun 
and having a jolly 

,. ^ S. Nathan Diehl, 

old tune. Then; ,sr,o ^^^^^^^^ ^a,Kr 
emotional involve- 
ment or emotional attachment for these peo- 

' Bui the sad thing is that the people who 
are all about seeing some action don't 
understand the enjoyment thai a rcbtion- 
ship can bring. They think sex is all a rcla- 
lionship can bc- 

I catuiot imagine my relationships tak- 
ing on such a shape, I suppose that if 1 was 
one to treat all of my friends as an object of 
desire and nothing more, 1 would hove lo 
choose lo be bisexual, which to me, and the 
vast majority of the civilized populalion, is 
not an option. 

You see, a dating relationship isn't all 
about 'getting some.' The mosl successful 
and most fulfilling relatioruhips are the rela- 
tioruhips that don't contain ihc "awkward 
silence" before a make-out session. 
Fulfillment from a relationship eomcs wilh 
open and total conununi cation. 

Communication can open channels lo 
the relationship that are othcrivise dosed. 
Wilh honest communication, trusi is devel- 
oped. With trust, the communication 
becomes corwislcntly more honest and deep. 
The level of fulfillment is unparalleled. 
The movie "Shallow Hal" comes to mind — 
someone (vho thinks only about sex is con- 
sidered shallow because he is unable to use 
communication to strengthen his relation- 
Think about this for a moment. What 
would your friendshiprelahonstiips be 
without CO mm uru cation? Shouldn't a dating 
relationship be a friendship- relationship that 
is deeper and stronger than a mere friend? 
This cannot be achieved by simply 'scoring;' 
it is achieved by open and honest commuju- 

But the question you now face is sim- 
ple: am I right or am I wrong? This is simple 
to test. Try this out when you're on a date 
tfiis weekend. Be vulnerable in your com- 
muiucation without becoming physically 
involved, and watch your relabor\ship soar 
to new heights.

Afghanistan was once a very

Af^anislan and other parts of 
Ihc Middle East were highly edu-

degrees in areas such as econom- 
ics. Women were professionals: 
lawyers, doctors, professots and

many other countries in the area,

extreme suffering for women.

For our generalion, this day of ivmcmiirance 
will become more than just o day when Ihe post 
offices close. Yet. many people know lilllc about 
what this holiday is really all about, - 

The holidoy falls on the ajiniversary of Ihe 
official end of World War 1, Nov. 11. 1918. Twenty- 
seven individual stales had already recognized 
Ihe dale as o holiday when it became a federal hol- 
iday on June 4, 1926. 

On May 13, 1938. Ihc day officially became 
known as Armistice Day. It was to be a day dedi- 
cated to the cause of world peace. 



holiday was opened It 



ol all tvars. On June I of.lhot same year, the name 
of Ihe holiday tvas officially changed to Wlerxin's 
Day so thai it was clear the day was lo honor all 
American veterans. 

AUo in 1954. Prwidcnt Dwighl D, 
Eisenhotver became Ihe Tirst pivsideni to make a 
Veteran's Day Proclajnation. 

In 1968, the Veteran's Day celebration was 
moved to the fourth Monday of^Oclober. This was 
lo offer federal employees a thnx day weekend 
that would encourage travel. It was nol until 1975 
thai Ihe holiday was moved back, with Ihe obser- 
vance of Ihe holiday gomg lo a Monday or Fndoy 
if Ihe actual date falls on a weekend- This was to 
keep in touch with (he original meaning of the 
day— (he end of World' War T. 

This year, more people (han usual will Ihink 
about Ihe meaning of Ihe holiday. Mosl will 
remember (hat it is a day lo honor veterans— and 
perhaps some will remember Ihat it is also a day 
dedicated lo Ihe end of war and Ihe beginning of 
world peace.

The return of Jordan, not Air Jordan 



NCAA rules on 8-year period

t.Slalf Writer 



What do MkhacI Jordan and my grandpa's 196S 
Camaro have in common? They're both old! 

Sure, back in their day they were sensations, but 
now they're both .i little msly. 

Tlie five-limi&gt; NBA Most Valuable Ploycr. six-time 
NBA linals Most Valuable Player and ten-time NBA all 
slar is back in the league. This time Jordan isn't charg- 
ing up and down the court with the Bulls, but instead 
is nancing in there, hoping lor some magic with the 
Wizards. ' 

I don't think manv people expected hiih to be Ihc 
samejordanlie was whenhcled Ine Bulls to six cham- 
pioruhip titles. He's not the same Jordan— he's older 
this time. 

Jordan is still a great basketball player; he just 
can'l run as last, |ump as high or defend the young 
guys like he could before. 

The young guards in the league like Kobe BrjMnl. 



Allen Iverson and Vince Carter will be showing lordan 
he's not the best player around these days. 

Perhaps Jordan's skills are not above the rim now, 
but on the drawing board. Jordan is returning to the 
NBA court OS a leader and mentor. He is playing with 
a young team in need ol direction and will be working 
with (he likes of Kwarne Broivn. who Jordan himseU 
drafted straight out of high school. 

Jondan has an uncaruiy ability of making tetter 
players ol those around him. It happened in Chicago 
and it probably will.happcn in D.C.

A. brief tour of fine restaurants in Fort Wayne 




By Andy Wellle, 
StaH Writer 



If you have lived in Fort Wayne for 
any significant amouni of time and 
have enjoy eating out, you probably 
already know and appreciate the wide 
selection of restaurants available. 
However, students attending this cam- 
pus who live out of town and are loo 
busy to lalie the lime to scope out the 
Wide World of Eating Out, you may 
appreciate the following. 

I have taken the grand responsibil- 
ity o( selecting and reviewing three 
restauranls — Ihree relatively nice, sil- 
down-and-be-served restaurants. In 
choosing these places, I needed to 
take into account the audience for 
whom I would be writing. For the most 
part, college students are without a 
whole lot of money and lime. I also 
decided to select restaurants that were 
not alike. So, after much deliberation. I 
picked these three. Cebollas Mexican 
Restaurant, The IWunchie Emporium 
and Biaggi's Ristorante llaliano. 

Ceballos 

My first port of call was Cebollas. 
The colorful fiesta-like atmosphere is 
accented by mariachi music playing in 
the background. First and foremost, I 
must talk about the chips and salsa. No 
Mexican restaurant worth its margarita 
salt would have bad, bland salsa. 
Cebollas did not disappoint. It was very 
authentic. The spice was considerable 
and lacked the annoyingly large chunks 
ol vegetables that are difficult to try to 
balance on your chip. Needless to say, 
I was impressed. 

The menu selection does not devi- 
ate from the typical array of Mexican 
cuisine. As long as you can handle 
spicy lood and can distinguish a burrilo 
from a sombrero, you'll be fine. There 
are also brief descriptions of the meals 
provided under the listings. 

I was most impressed by the chick- 
en tajila (S6.60). The entree included 
two tortillas, sour cream, lettuce, pico 
de gallo, Spanish rice, charro beans 
and a hoi plate of chicken, onions and 
peppers. The chicken was pretty good. 
Having been freshly grilled, it was ten- 
der and juicy. The other vegetables on 
the hot plate were rather overcooked — 
the peppers were somewhat mushy 
and the onions had almost lost their 
crunch. As for the toppings, the lettuce 
was fresh and the pico de gallo was 
nothing out of the ordinary. The tortillas 
that came with the meal were not bad, 
although as is the case when tortillas 
are wrapped together, it was difficult to 
separate them without tearing them. As 



a pleasant surprise, after I ate all of the 

tortillas, the waitress promptly asked 
me if I wanted more, and brought them 
out quickly after t answered her in the 
affirmative. The Spanish rice was ordi- 
nary and the beans were a bit too 
sweet for my palate, although the 
cheese melted on top of was a nice 
touch. 

The story was a bit different with 
the Cebollas Special {S6.99). This is a 
large plate containing a chicken burnto 
and a chicken enchilada with lettuce, 
tomato and avocado. It was presented 
rather haphazardly, with the lettuce 
thrown on top, making it a challenge to 
find the meal underneath! The produce 
was fresh, although the chicken with 
this meal was rather lough. It seemed 
that it may have been cooked too long 
or at too high of a temperature. It was- 
n't bad, but it wasn't impressive, either. 

The plate to avoid getting Is the 
Taquitos Mexicano ($5.25), which is a 
lunch item, It consists of two deep-lned 
flautas, lettuce, pico de gallo. gua- 
camole, sour cream, rice and beans. 
Although the rice and beans were okay. 
the flautas were burnt on the end! I 
realize that because they were deep 
fried, they rose to extremely high tem- 
peratures, but it is alarming to bite into 
a charred black piece of chicken and 
tortilla. As with the Special, the chicken 
was tough. 

Service wise, Cebollas excelled. 
Our waitress promptly refilled our soft 
drinks and iced lea and stood by for 
more sour cream and tortillas. She 
refilled our bowl of chips, however, the 
bill took longer than usual to arrive. 

Munchie Emporium : 



Munchie Emporium, on MaplecresI 
Road, has an unusual atmosphere to 
say the least. II sod of blends the mem- 
orabilia from a sports bar wilh vinlage 
advertising signs and movie posters, 
yet maintains a sort of '60s tone. 
Unusual as it is. I did find it to be aes- 
thetically pleasing. The menu selec- 
tions are varied, including everything 
from a veggie burger lo salmon. 

For a vegetarian view, I took the 
liberty of ordering a vegetarian meal. I 
got the veggie burger ($4.95), consist- 
ing of mushrooms, bean sprouts and 
other various bits Ihat, when alive, 
never said moo. It was sen/ed on sliced 
bread and came with tasty trench fries. 
Lettuce and tomato were served on the 
side and mayonnaise was supplied at 
my request. The burger itself was all 
right. 1 am not a vegetarian. I'll admit 
that I was comparing it to a real animal- 
burger. II wasn't as good as the real 
thing. Compared to other veggie burg- 
ers I've had over the years, it was in the 
upper echelon. 

The second dish was a seafood 
platter, the Cajun Shrimp ($10.95). It 
included several jumbo shrimp on a 
bed of zesty beans and rice, surround- 
ing a large cup of buttery dipping 
sauce. The shrimp was excellent and 
had a texture reminiscent of extremely 



tender chicken, rather than Iha spongy, 

fishy low-quality shrimp thai is found at 
some places. The beans and rice were 
nothing exceptional, but were fresh and 
had a nice Southwestern tang. The 
spice was subtle, yel noticeable. 

For dessert, one simply must order 
the raspberry cheesecake (83.50). It 
was wonderful. It was a large piece ol 
squishy cheesecake tilting on a 
crunchy Oreo-like dark chocolate crust 
(although i! dark chocolate isn't your 
thing, you may think differently), with a 
raspberry layer on top Ihat pleasantly 
surprised me wilh its langiness. 

Service was very good. My iced lea 
was lopped off several times from the 
infamous never-ending pitcher wielded 
by the waiter's hand and barely live 
minutes went by between our orders 
being taken and the food being deliv- 
ered to the table. 



Biaggi's 



Last, but by no means the least, we 
have Biaggi's. II is across town from 
IPFW, but was chosen because it is 
certainly the most upscale of the three 
restaurants. It is also one of Fort 
Wayne's newest digs, having been built 
within Ihe last two months at Jefferson 
Pointe shopping center. It is still 
extremely busy, however, and I had to 
make a reservation on a Wednesday 
night and still couldn't get in until 7:15 
in Ihe evening. Take a date here to 
impress him or her. 

The atmosphere is that ol a trendy, 
upscale cosmopolitan Italian restau- 
rant. I was expecting to see Tony 
Soprano walk through Ihe front door at 
any moment. A lively Sinatra lune 
played in the background and a bistro- 
like paper was over the tablecloth and 
the seat. 

The sen/ice was exemplary. The 
waitress was knowledgeable about the 
food she served. I ashed her several 
questions regarding Ihe food and she 
didn't have lo check with the kilchen 
once. (Being Ihe optimist I am, I chose 
not to think thai she may have been 
making it up.) 

For our dining pleasure, a delightful 
array ol breads kepi us busy until our 
order was taken. Included was a basic 
baguette bread, a warm and smooth 
Foccacia bread and a rather coarse 
nine-grain bread. When Ihe waitress 
came to take our drink orders, she 
poured olive dipping oil, a spoonful of 
parmesan cheese and ground fresh 
black pepper into a saucer. It was a 
pleasant experience. 

Although normally I do nol dwell on 
drinks, 1 must compliment the iced tea. 
I was warned before thai the tea wasn't 
plain and that it had a black currant fla- 
vor. I was fine with that, being a fan of 
flavored tea. I was particularly 
impressed by this lea. though. The fla- 
vor wasn't overwhelming: H was only a 
slight aroma. 

The house salad ($3.50) was 
divine. It was made of a variety of let- 
luce, mostly consfsling of what looked 



like romalne, with a very tangy vinai- 
grette Ihat was made of what was 
explained to be a balsamic vinegar with 
herbs and gariic. Cherry tomalo halves 
were arranged attractively on the plate 
around it. Likewise, the Caesar salad 
($3.50) was lasty. It had a slight hint of 
the famous Casa's salad, bul wilh a 
juicier caesar dressing Ihat was egg- 
less. The best part of the salad was the 
homemade croutons (I wholeheartedly 
support the use of croutons. They can 
make or break a salad,). 

The best thing on Ihe menu is Ihe 
Fettucini with Lobster (510.95). It is 
comprised of unusually fantastic pasta, 
lossed with lobsler chunks (Lobsters 
are belter in chunks That way they 
don'i look like big bugs.) and wild 
mushrooms in what the menu 
describes as a white wine and scallion 
cream sauce. 

For the less adventurous diners, 
Biaggi's offers a selection of nine-inch 
pizzas. The pepperoni and pesto pizza 
(S6.50) was excellent. The crust was 
thin and crispy and butlery al Ihe top. It 
was layered nicely wilh cheese, basil, 
pesto, black olives and tomatoes. The 
cheese was especially nch. If you can- 
not handle rich food, be forewarned 
and eat stowly. 

This exceptional dining experience 
continued with a magnificent dessert. I 
ordered bread pudding. Now, i( you are 
familiar with bread pudding, you will 
know that it has an unusual texture due 
lo the combination of a cake-like sub- 
stance and custard. This dessert was 
flawlessly prepared with a smooth tran- 
sition between the two elements. 
Surrounding the main body was a white 
chocolate sauce wilh a raspberry 
sauce hidden beneath. Ii was delicious. 

Although I realize I may sound like 
a pushover because of the excellent 
review I gave Biaggi's. 1 was hard- 
pressed to find anything bad with the 
experience. In fact, the only two cons I 
could find were Ihe detergent spots on 
the silverware and the length of lime it 
took lo gel a drink refill. And although 
Biaggi's is obviously pricier, all-in-all, it 
was the best of Ihe three. It will be inter- 
esting to see what it is like in a year, 
after the newness and novelty have 
worn off. 

So, here you have il — Ihe skinny 
on the eating scene in this happening 
town (Although if you pay loo much 
attention, it won't be skinny much 
longer). Who knew Ihat a medium- 
sized town in northern Indiana could 
have such a diverse selection ol places 
to eat? This is just a small sampling of 
the dining establishments found here: 
just three joinis in a town that ranges 
from McDonald's to Park Place Grille 
and Irom Cindy's Diner to Catablu. ifou 
can lake this newfound knowfedge and 
go oul and impress people during 
casual conversation. Enjoy, and happy 
eating!

B/ Renee Thompson, Assistant Editor of 
Special Sections 

What makes a cup of coffee more Ihan 
just a plain cup ol coffee? Espresso, of 
course! Tfiis super-strong drink often is 
ordered not by cups, but by sfiols and is 
often mixed witli everything from milk to 
\ kahlua. 

So wtial makes me qualilied to critique 
different coffeetiouses? Well, there was 
once this little baby {that's me) whose 
mother used to mix her formula with coffee 
in order lo gel her going in the morning. If I 
add all the years togelher, I've been drink- 
ing coffee for about 17 and a half years 
now. First, it started out with regular 
fulaxwell coffee made by my mother. Then 
when I turned 15. i( quickly developed into 
high-powered caffeine drinks containing 
espresso. 

For the review, I asked myself, "What 
would be Ihe appropriate drink lo use to 
critique a coffeehouse?" After trying just 
about every drink twice over Ihe span of 
I two days, I came to the conclusion that the 
simple lalle was the way to go. A latte is 
made with steamed milk and one shot of 
espresso. It |usl doesn't gel any easier 
than thai. 

But much more goes into Ihe whole 
coffeehouse experience than just coffee. 
It's the service and the setting that make a 
coffee shop a coffeehouse. It has lo be a 
place where people can sit and lalk and 
nol worry about Ihe troubles of the day. A 
place where students can work on home- 
work while they drink their caffeine-rich 
dnnks and a place Ihat people like me can 
call a second home. 



Higher Grounds 



were friendly and the service was fasi. 



For my first visit, I chose the coffee- 
house that has been and always will be my 
favorite: Higher Grounds. For about the 
past three years, I have spent Ihe majority 
of my time there, drinking coffee, working 
on homework and meeting friends. Il does- 
n't matter if you go lo fWlaplecresI, DuponI 
or even the one on campus — the service 
and the coffee are exlraordinarv 

I went in like I usually do. Backpack 
over my shoulder, the hungry look (or cof- 
fee in my eye. I didn't mention thai I was 
doing a review and Ihey never suspected 
anything. The workers greeted me with a 
smile and the aroma of freshly-made 
espresso filled my nose. I sat down, took a 
sip of my steaming latle and watched my 
cares fly oul the window. Then I looked 
down next to me and saw my history book 
practically screaming my name. Everything 
goes much belter with a good latte. 

The Mill 

After my Higher Grounds experience. I 
was off lo another popular coffeehouse — 
The Mill. I walked in and found little chil- 
dren, moms, breads and coffee. Interesting 
combination! So far, this is the only place 
where servers asked if I wanted one shot 
or two, cocoa, cinnamon or nutmeg. It may 
sound silly, bul little things like thai make 
your dhnk your dnnk, made to your specifi- 
cations. The bread was good; the scream- 
ing children were bad. Even though there 
was jazz music playing, it just wasn'l the 
true coffeehouse atmosphere. The lalle 
was good, a liltle watery lasting, bul the 
hint of nutmeg sure was nice. The workers 



Starbucks 

For my last review, I weni lo the new 
Starbucks at Jefferson Poinle. I think this 
next line sums it all up: "It's all hype." For 
people trying to sell a product, they sure 
didn't know Ihe meaning ol customer serv- 
ice. I went in a litlle later in the evening, 
about 45 minutes before they closed, and 
Ihe worker lold me not lo order anything 
loo complicated thai would make a mess. 1 
fell like saying, "Give me Ihe messiest 
drink you have!" I didn't though; I jusl 
ordered a lalle. It was watery and Ihe cof- 
fee was biller, not flavorful. Being the nice 
person I am, I decided lo give Ihem a sec- 
ond shot. I wenI in a few days later and 
ordered a vanilla cappuccino. Once again, 
the same drink-maker as before told me 
thai there is no difference between a cap- 
puccino and a latte. Sure there is— foam 
versus steamed milk. 1 will give Ihem this, 
though — they do have very good iced 
mochas. I think they can handle sweet 
drinks better lhan they can handle just n 
mal coffee drinks. 

In conclusion, I've gotta say this- 
you want a good lalle and a nice atmos- 
phere, go lo 
Higher Grounds. If 
you wanl good 
bread, Iry Ihe 
Mill. If you want 
over-priced col- 
fee, go to 
Starbucks.

Q. 



By Renee Thompson, Assistant Edilor of Special Sedrons 

"I want a coffee war," said ti^ark Lamboley, owner 
ol Daddieo DaVinci. 

Daddieo DaVinci is located at 5905 Bluffton Road 
and IS definitely worth Ihe 15-minute drive from cam- 
pus. From Ihe twinkling lights lo the musical gigs on 
the weekends, this coffee house is sure lo make any 
coffee lover feel righl at home. 



Considering myself a connoisseur of the coffee 
bean, I was somewhat skepiical when Lamboley pro- 
claimed, "We have the best coffee in town!" Bul, after 
sampling several of the various mochas and lattes, all 
doubts where erased. 

Unlike other businesses of Ihe like, Daddieo's 
houses a wide variety of exotic coffee beans which 
can be made inlo an espresso shot, making the most 
common of gourmet coffees superior lo the ordinary, 
Lamboley explained thai what makes his coffee so 
much belter lhan other establishments' is Ihat he 
doesn't use an espresso blend lo make his shots. 
Instead he uses Ihe customer's choice of fresh 
ground Sumatra, Colombian or Brazil Bourdon beans, 
jusl to name a few. 

So. you may be wondering what a Sumatra cof- 
fee is and how 11 differs from jusl a normal espresso 
blend. Well, according lo Daddieo Davinci's webpage, 
www.daddieodavinci.com, "Sumalra has a full-bod- 
ied, earthy character." 

Of course, the best way lo find out is through a 
laste lest, which is what 1 happily agreed lo. 



Lamboley made two diflerenl types of latles for me: 
one made with Columbian coffee, which I thought 
would be the best, and another made with Sumatra 
colfee. To my surprise, Ihe Sumaira coffee packed a 
powerful flavor Ihal Ihe Columbian latte tacked. It 
blew away the competition of Ihe other latles, mochas 
and house coffees I had previously tried. After drink- 
ing a Sumatra latte, it is going to be hard to go back 
lo the old espresso-blends. If you're looking for a 
smoolh, flavorful espresso, try Daddieo's Special. It is 
a Breve made with Sumatra coffee and half and hall. 
Trust me, the added calories are worth il! 

For the coffee drinker on-the-go, Daddieo 
DaVinci is one of the few coffeehouses in Fort Wayne 
that has a drive-through window. In Ihe evenings on 
the weekends, there are jazz concerts. For Ihe artists, 
they also host pottery shows. 

So. if you're a coffee nut like I am, go oul and give 
Daddieo Davinci a try. I have a feeling you'll be 
hooked by Ihe excellent prices, friendly atmosphere 
and superb coffee.
