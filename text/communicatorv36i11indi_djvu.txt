Free public 
lecture held 
inKettler 



free public lecture, 
featured speaker is Nigerian 
professor Simi Afonja, from the 
Institute for Advanced Study 
(IAS) at Indiana University 
Bloomington. The talk will 
be held in Kettler Hall Room 
G46 at 6:00 p.m. and is entitled 
"Women Defining Democracies 

Afonja intends to discuss 
the pursuit of social scientists 
and feminists in Africa for 
new answers to the problems 
of female development on the 
African continent. Western and 
European ideals have heavily 
influenced the perception of 
gender and feminism in Africa 
and are not always beneficial 
in this setting, particularly 
when developing strategies for 
cultural acceptance of gender 
equality. 

Her presentation will 
focus on the conceptual bias 
Western and Eurocentric 
ways of thought have had 
in African development. 
The abandonment of these 
theories has produced new 
manners of inquiry and new 
methodologies, which are more 
appropriate when dealing 
with African nations. Afonja 
will consider and present the 

face when considering matters 
of gender in a culturally diverse 
setting and how to approach 



Bloomington focuses 
research that crosses cultural 
borders and perceived 
limitations within a given field 
of study. The IAS is responsible 
for Afonja's visit to IPFW.

Saw 2" saws off good taste 



Film Review 




o. the wrong stuli! Donnie, Donnie, Donnie. 
You really need u. realize thai you're not your 
brother. Marky Mark has managed to come 

mil of his "music career" unscathed and make a 
name for himself in Hollywood. Unfortunately, 
you're not .is luuky. I understand thai you were in 
"The Sixth Sense", anil I give you props fur th.it 
[| lakes true commitment to lose -1.1 pounds for 
a role. Sadly, however, from the moment you 
stepped into ihe shot in 'Saw II', I couldn't keep

But I couldn'l stop myself. There he 
(VV.ihlbergl was- a big, bail cop-smoking and 
cussing anil throwing stuff; .mil .ill I could do was 
cover my mnuih in muffle my snorts of hysteria. 
It was pat heiic. It look every once of restraint in 
my live loot two inch frame to not bust out the 
"Humiirig M.in"! What happened to the Donnie 
U.ihliieig liuni tm favorite liny- hand. The New 
Kids on Ihe blocks I mean, I'm not going to lie. 
i thought he was a dork back then, but I was 
seven! I've matured. I was sure he had too. 1 
shouldn't be giving Wahlherg so much crap; 
he wasn't the only second-rate actor in this 
gratuitously violent atrocity. Lucv Camden, oh 
I'm sorry, I meant Beverley Mitchell, was just 
as bad. Her dealh scene was uproarious. Her 
sputtering breath, convulsing body, and, don't 



forget, the reddish-brown goo oozing out of 
her slack-jawed mouth made lor an altogether 
humorous display. PS. Mitchell, when you've 
playing the quintessential "good girl'' for almost 



Smith reprises her role as 
Amanda— you know, the chick with the freaky 
death mask?? Well, she's death mask-less in 
the new one. Instead, she's been chosen by the 
sadistif sociopath, ligsaw. because she "wasn't 
taking eery gooii care of herself" So now she's 



in some way (that's pan nl ligs.uv's game, by the 
way). The point of the game'' is to put two and 
two together and find a way out in less than two 
hours, lest you die a vicious death a la Mitchell- 
style. Smith's made it through before, SO I had 
faith she'd do h again. Naturally, however, there's 
always one person that throws a kink in the 
plan. Pranky G (yes. that's really his name) is 

Not that he was ever a "good" actor, 
but he was much better in "The Italian lob"— 
uuncidentlv with the younger Wahlberg— than 
he was in "Saw II". He just got angry and killed 
people. 1'hat's all he really did. Whoop- dee-do. 
Basil. Of course, his killings were more explicit 
than even those ot Jigsaw himself 1 ['here were 
more holes in ihis plot than in the original, 
first of all. we only sort o/learn how everyone's 
connected, bin the issue is glazed over quickly. 



Secondly, some of the c 

asinine things. Perfect example. Addison, the 
token hoi chick, puts her arm in a container that 
chops her to pieces. So what does she do? She 
shoves the other one in— because that's the most 
intelligent thing to do! Then she screams and 
cries for help, but to no avail she subsequently 
bleeds to death. Poor little hot chick.

winning suundlraek 1 ton Iron has been broken 
up since before Garden State's soundtrack was

of "Details". 

One look at the artwork on the album 
shows that the hand leans towards a more classy 
I uropean taste. In this situation, you M.Vi judge

Of course "Details" begins with it's hit 
song, "Let Go," which for the many of those who 
have heard the song will bring about a shiver 
down your spine encouraging you to listen on. 
I'wo things that distinguish ibis release are the 
popular European synth and soothing female 
vocals by Imogen Heap. These, plus the guitar 
and drum parts create an overall mix of European 
indie rock and techno, spawning more of the type

The top ten "we're in college" movies 



In the longstanding i radii ion ol collage r mines sliown in the ivy 
covered halls of ncadeinia. I have- taki'ii it upon myself to create a 
top ten list of worthy and pnssihh, thoheMt ullage Comedy movies 
of all time. It was a tough thing in do. In dwindle down all of the 
great collage movies ivas loughcr tJi.m deciding what child to save 
in the midst of a disaster. 

The movies that I came up with our my own personal top ten, 
they don't represent the ideas of any Studio or foundation. These 
e alone. 1 hope that in some way people will 

of all Time are as 



10. Real Genius Marring Ya I kilmci I saw tins movie (or the first 
time when I was about eight years old. lis combination of youthful 
exuberance combined with a snappy use of dialogue and 30 year 
old man who lives in a closet makes iliis very delightful. This is 
i by a gigantu |i|'|'y |iM|i exploding in a urns house and 
e being found naked with a bowl of |ell-0. Who could ask 
for more? 

9. Next is definitely the movie Old School, starring Vince 
Vaughn, Luke Wilson and Will Icrrell I his movie is the epitome of 
"I can't let go of college" movie. Plus, it has spawned many good 
lines. "It's feels so good when ii hits your lips" comes lo mind, along 
with the ever popular around my baby cousins "Ear muffs, come 
on, ear muffs". The supporting i ,isi also offers up its own spastic 
kinds of comedy, the subtle wives, the oral sex teacher and a very 
hillybillied out Seann William Scott as an animal wrangler. Such a 
movie, even though not ranking ver\ high mi the list, 'does deserve 



to lie recognized. 

8. Revenge Of the Nerds holds a vers' special place in my heart. 
It taught me thai being oneselt will get you into bedrooms quicker 
than anything else. In this age old tale ot. brains over brawn, the 
nerds of Lambda Lambda Lambda square off against the Alpha 
Betas in every way you can imagine Kevenge also Spawned 3 
sequelsontopoln. winch is something io be pi oud of even though 
all of them sucked I he oilier thing that made me appreciate this 
movie was the simple idea of the Party Raid. Now who overwrote 
that idea into the script was a bloody genius! No better scene in a 
movie than that. The surprise of a nerd seeing a naked woman for 
the first time, priceless. 

7. Although it is naturally panned by most people, PCU, This is 
just a simple and classic story of man 
young Jeremy I'iveu, add a smidcly s 
have a mix of a good show. 

6. The Graduate is simple enotigl 
from college, doesn't know- \\ 



an affair with his next door neighbor. ,nU\ Ming from Simon and 
Gariunkleand you got an Oscar winner I low- sweet IS that? 

Half way there! Woo boo 1 I sit here, the night before the deadline 
thinking this up. I think so far its a good list considering the 
pressure. 

On to number IV American he 2. Filmed in the heartland, also 
known as Muskegon. Michigan, ii showed whai lollcgc guys should 
do every summer. Party, work and have a non-stop good time. 
Between trying lo see lesbian neighbors, throwing beach parties 
and tracking down ih.it random girl bom high s, bool it proposed 
a good time. I encourage people to watch this one. I think it's the 
best oi all of them. 

4. The time tested college t radii ion ol the lioad Trip. Tom Green, 
Seann William Scott. Paulo Conslanzo, D.J. Quails and Tom Green. 
From the get go, this movie pushes the bounds of being politically 
correct. They steal i hosii lib ml k ids. pin end lobe the members 



of an all African Amerii.iu fraternity and tuni snake feeding into a 
small obsession. On top of trying to beat the I IS Postal Service from 
delivering a home made porno i.ipe What acatalyst? 

3. What would a comedy list be without I'aulie Shore? The movie 
Son-In-Law is college comedy at its very best. Think about this 
and how many times its come tiueV (hiiet. straight arrow Midwest 
country girls goes off to college, meets a wild and crazy guy and 
becomes a far Hung impression ol net ■ former self? Sound like real 
life? Plus it pokes a lot ol fun at being an RA. I wonder if any RA's 
on our campus have hammocks? I wonder if any of them allow 
d nuking in (lie dorms .nul inni a blind eye? 

2. Ok friends, we're down to the top two Second is always the 
first loser and my number two college comedy has to he National 
Lampoon's Van Wilder According to a well read friend of mine, 
"it is the personification ot a college lifer who accomplishes so 
much without really accomplishing anything". It's hilarious. It 
proposes a new idea and standard to the tvpie.il college movie. A 
college comedy, not really about ,i student but a force of nature on 
a college campus. Also, how many can debate so many quips from 
Ryan Reynolds in the move that made him famous? 

Ok, drum roll please . in my opinion the greatest college movie 
of all time has lo be and will always be National Lampoon's animal 



w oinan/ ing leader of i I icp.it k, i liter Ibis is my favorite movie and 
one of the only I could watch over and over. To me, it shows that 
college can be fun if you just don't &lt; 
on, we're college students We can do anything" 



Thrice puts out three times the music 



Although the band's tendency is to be lumped with the 
underground's sei eamo and b.nd. ore bands, die release of Vheissu 
has allowed them to perform on Jimmy Kimmel, air on MTV and 
hit number 17 on the Billboard Top 200, This is not your everyday 
band, and they show the world just that with their newest album. 

Upon popping Vheissu into a stereo any fan will notice 
a difference from older albums, one big enough that it may 
compromise the fan's loyalty. The band has evolved from a 
harder sound with tight metal guitar riffs into something more 
experimental that could possibly have roots from bands such as 
Radiohead and Implosions in the Sky. It has been described by 

Is of Morse t ode is I hnce's 



Leading off the album with tl 



new anthem sounding "Image ol (In Invisible." I be song is simple 
and rhythm based, but is strung and powerful with the band's 
battle cries and a slower, emotional section "Image of Invisible" 
succeeds in being the classic "attention getter intro" to Vheissu 
and sums up the rest of the album with its positive message of 
"everyone is a being of unconditional worth." 

Although all 1 1 songs ,ne pnwerlul and have their own artistic 
highlights, "The earth Will Shake," is one that definitely stands 
out. The entire song is based on chain gang prison songs, where 
prisoners would sing while they worked li is shown botli lyrically, 
singing about breaking out ol prison, and musically through hack 
and forth chanting and the sounds of beating the ground. 

"Atlantic" showcases an elegant and eerie piano leading 
into Coldplay-soiuiding voials backed by what sounds like a 
tambourine. This song proves the variety of the album along with 
how the band has evolved from year one, where the band was a 
last upbeat style of punk rock. 

The only song that comes close to resembling Thrice's last 
release, The Artist in the Ambulance, is "Hold Fast Hope." Even 
' i g tracks continue to display 
s creativity. "Music Box," is 



Just as Vheissu started oil the album with a bang, they decided 
to go out with one. "Red Sky 1 ' is definitely one of the highlights 
of the album with its mellow anil beautiful tune. In a way It is a 
reassuring and encom aging song allowing the listener to turn off 
their stereo happy, sii b.u k and tb ink about lite in a new way.

State Of The Arts 






In 8' h grade, while dwindling away my days of pubescence 
in class, looking up girls skirts, going to church and trying to 
maintain a const ant state of suspicion around ibis rather large kid 
who liked to beat me to a pulp, I came across a band called The 
Brian Setzer Orchestra Some ol you might remember him. Rock- 
a-Billy crooner from New Jersey who brings m light the musical 
stylings of the late Carl Perkins anil I ddie Cochrane? Yeah, that 
guv Fie was pretty popular back in the day. 

After him. I came across Big Bad Voodoo Daddy also 
known as that "hip, swing band from the movie Swingers." Now 
these guys really rocked out. I bey marched to a tune their own, 
sharp like a knife, sassy like a woman and classy like well, a 
woman. Saxophones, guitars, drums, you name it and hardly any 
vocals, these guys put the swing mm suing Very reminiscent of the 
Benny Goodman Orchestra combined with a trumpeter who is the 
" " "fes Davis. I spent many an afternoon listening 



The last band is the (lie try F'oppin' I laddies or the dirtiest 
ol any band I've ever beard of. 1 actually got in trouble and 
o spend a day in silent prayer because I brought one ol their 



CDs to my school. .Needless to say. Si. Jude's Catholic wasn't ready 
for a swing revolution. Either way, one big hit "Zoot Suit Riot." 
Pretty hip, decent to dance to if you knew how. 

Anyway, needless to say, as soon as this orchestrated 
madness known as swing music hit the scene, it lost its fancy. I 
think mainly because people couldn't dance to it (1 could and still 
can 1 am proud to say) thus making ii really |ust kind of ambient 

Now, to my point of this rambling retrospective of a lost 
love of mine. I think we need to see swing make a comeback. 
Literally, people should learn how to do this stuff. I am listening 
to a compilation and there isn't a sad song amongst them. It is 
purely happy musk , hell bent on proposing (be idea of good times 
with careless disregard for the norm. Every song is about booze, 
dancing, sex, late nights and parrying till the break of dawn, Now 
tell me that there isn't a single pel son on this college campus who 
that doesn't appeal to?! 

Swing music is something that I consider purely from my 
generation. On the heels of the popularity of SKA and other big- 
band wannabes, swing didn't seek out a class of people, it created 
one. Zoot suits, poodle skins, lots of hair gel, cars with flames, 
swing gave us the answers of what to do when times got tough. 
Just dance, have a good lime and check your worries at the door. I 
love the songs wrapped up in it. The mix of orchestral layout and 
rock'n'roll guitar rifts i reaie a perfei t balance lor those who desire 
a musical cornucopia of sules and rhythms. 



I never really did appreciate swing niusii until I got oldei 
and bolder. It came as a surprise m people that someone like me 
could move like swing dancers do. I'll admit. I ain't the skinniest 
guy around, but remember, even Chris I ar ley could do the splits. I 
also never appreciated the beats as much. 

I will petition for people, fansol suing music or people who are 
just apt to try new things to embrace this musical monstrosity. I 
look back into my massive CD and MPS collection and I can find 
nothing else I'd rather listen to in the morning or before going out 
with a beautiful lady to where ever the road takes us that night. 
Swing is positive, it's happy, it's upbeat and by God it'll make you 
want to move your feet. 

As I get older, swing music becomes even more dearer to my 
heart. I am a history buff and 
to a past culture. Days when tl 
had pride in America and baseball 
Back in the day when going to wa 
an idiotic thing. Swing music is the 

and, just as history repeals ilsell, niusn ,il history will repeal itself. 
But 1 will wait. I will go on with my life, listening to whatever suits' 
my fancy at the time until the next swing revolution comes to 
town. Then I plan to be the first man, probably seventy years old 
with bad knees and twenty kids, on the dance floor cutting a rug 
with all the kids. Showing them that the music they enjoy now isn't 
new, but resurrected Swing will come again, oh yes it will and it'll 
come at a lime when it i-- needed the most. 



still the nmnbei tine sport,

The Bullseye 

Welcome to Thunderdome 



my opinic 






international political sped rum 
is in world-class upheaval. 
The global north is holding 
an oppressive iron grasp over 
the global south. Poverty and 
radicalism reign supreme in 
third world nations. Democracy 
is being utilized as a tool to 
squash the ideals of the people. 
This variation on political 
power is no more evident than 
in the United State's crusade to 
civilize and bring democracy to 
the Middle East, - 

It is my firm opinion that 
trying to bring democracy t 



ideals, with a little tweaking 
could be, and possibly already 
are seen in the Middle East. 

Number one states ' that; 
"Popular forces can win a war 
against the enemy". In 



: bull's-eye and sign 
that states "Attack us first". Bear 
with me. while I explain this. 

Put yourself in the mind 
of the Middle Eastern 
fundamentalist. You hate 
America and everything it 



Revolution, the Iraqi insurgents 
are waging a war much like our 
own. They are fighting for their 
beliefs. They are fighting for 
what they passionately believe 
ts right. The scary factor is that 
they are armed to the teeth, as 
massive in numbers and have 
no qualms with killing anyone, 
including him or her who gets 
in the way of their mission.

you're fighting a guerilla v

Imagine you have to wake 
up, pray and go to banle with 
what you consider the scourge 
of humanity. You shoot to kill, 
bomb to destroy and spread 
fundamental propaganda 
throughout the people. 

Now step forward in the 
future, the war is over. America 
has succeeded in its mission 
to instill democracy in Iraq!

Simply Ludicrous 



This was a hard week for a column 
people, so i aimed for a little levity. I warn 
you, this may be the most ludicrous thing 
ever written. You he the judge. 

Two lesser-read news stories this week 
focus on glue. 

The first comes from Colorado and 
1 tragic hero. ..Bob Dougherty. 



Kenneth Slaby, former boyfriend of the 
attacker and all around good guy. is seeking 
S30.000 in damages as a result of what 
he claims a vindictive act of adhesion. 
O'Toole painfully pasted Slaby s penis to 
his stomach {not to mention gluing his 
buttocks together and painting a profanity 






i back with fingernail polish) as In: 



1 would successlullv capture its 
prey (Bob) and refuse to liberate him for 

You see, someone had laced the toilet 
seat with glue... rather powerful glue. 

Employees of the Home Depot ignored 
Bob's heartrending pleas for assistance. 

Bob's short-lived bond with that 
bathroom Beelzebub apparently resulted 
in a toilet-tortured psyche and endless 
haunting by porcelain poltergeists 
because now, two years after the fact, 
Bob's posttraumatic stress syndrome has 
produced a lawsuit. . .all at the hands of a 
small dollop of glue. 

A more tender area is the victim in the 
glue attack of Gail O'Toole. 



O'Toole's lawyer claims the act was 
consensual. 

Consensual... Consensual! I realize that 
people do some screwy stuff in the name 
of love but I cannot fathom verbalizing 



in this condition. 

Any other consideration of the incident 
causes me significant discomfort. 

So, glue seemed to be the theme of the 
week. I decided to do an Internet search 
for glue and all that turned up (outside of 
these two rather sticky stories) was endless 
data regarding the beloved pastime of 



scrapbooking. I happened a^ 



from the Kane County Chronicle by Laura 
Castle that had several quotes expounding 
the greatness nl m; rap booking. 

One advocate of this joyous activity 
discussed the future benefits, they see their 
infatuation with bonding agents and pretty 
pictures as "spending time for something 
that you know will last and be passed down 
from generation to generation." 

I would suggest that the two gentlenu 
who had the run-in with the toilet se 
and fuming ex would have to agree. Tt 
situations they encountered will mo 
definitely be passed down to subsequet 
generations. 

Glue is powerful stuff, It sticks things I 
our asses, our stomachs (dear God, I cringe 
every time I ponder that one), it can even 
stick things to fibrous pages of love and 
enjoyment. Most importantly, however. 
is the way glue can stick things in our 
memories without any direct application. 

Thank you Bob Dougherty.. .and thank 
you Kenneth Slaby... I commend 
painful tales. ..you are adhered ti 
forever.

will no longer be able to sustain yourself and, ultimately, sink. 

In more philosophical terms, it basically emphasizes the need 
to either adapt to the situation, or allow yourself to fail. 

It's a term that seems especially relevant in college. This is the 
point in our lives when we as students as determining our future 
in hard, tangible terms: we are preparing for our careers and we

lounging in the kiddie pool, but it can change into a borderless,

Reality's lopsided masterpieces 



In Other Words 



As a photography student I am required 
to take a few an classes. Currently I am in 
Design Fundamentals II where I make 3-D 
projects. The latest exhibition of my non- 
existent talent is a plaster sculpture. I am 
still not sure why I have to take an classes 
when my strong points lie in a darkroom 
and behind the lens. But, being the super 
senior that I am and wanting to graduate 
before my family begins to think I'm going 
for my doctorate degree i trudge along with 
each and every class and project thrown 
my way. 

With this particular project we were 
required toy sketches are always dark and 



I think the thing that is so hard about 
this project is that 1 am carving and always 
taking away. I was on the phone discussing 
this project- the pros and cons of it- with 
another student in class when he brought 
up the point that in art we're usually adding 
to something and that this project seemed 
backwards as the image emerged from a 
block of plaster instead of the remains from 
a pencil being rubbed on a piece of paper. 

When a person is drawing they add the 
shadows and crevices to their masterpiece. 
While sculpting one has to add the 
highlights by creating negative space. 

In life we often find that lite negatives in 



images in class seem to be. No, Bri had to 
pick one of the most depressing images 
she could conjure up in her head to carve 
and chisel. I am trying to carve a woman 
falling to her knees as she s 
hands while a man attempts

a highlight. 

After the phone call I stepped back and 
examined my hunk of plaster. I could see 
inside the block, could see what I wanted 

take off or where to take from. 

I kept thinking about the past week 
and everything that had happened to me 
personally and wondering where I had 
'1 from my masterpiece 



of life and where I had not given enough 
attention. 1 was lopsided, this I knew. Too 
much time spent on this relationship or at 
that dead-end job. In the grand scheme of 
things I needed to step back and look at my 
life like this hunk of plaster. 

Here I am, a 23-year-old student trying 
to understand why life hasn't handed me 
those things I think I need most in my 
life- the perfect job, the perfect friends, the 
perfect lover, the perfect family, and yes, 
even the perfect pet (my dog has become 
quite mean lately). 

As I continue to chip away at my life 
letting various projects, people, and jobs 
take up my time I urge everyone reading 
this do take a moment to step back and 
examine what's going on. 

I let emotions cloud my thoughts and 
other people's actions limit my own. Don't 
be afraid to rotate your masterpiece and 
look at your life from a different angle. 
Sometimes you'll just be able to reflect on 
the progress and you'll feel satisfaction 
and other times you'll be able to recognize 
it is you need improvements,

s sitting outside the oilier d.iy wan I line, my dogs playing in 
the backyard and taking a break from school and it occurred to me 
how happy and carefree they were. Of course they are dogs, but 
at the same time they seemed to let any worries fly by and they 
were enjoying the sunshine and fresh air. 1 wondered at how much 
I take for granted the wonders around us I don't want to get all 
theological and say how much a higher being has given US, but I 
truly marvel at the simple things in life and how much just taking 
the time to notice diem can change your mood. I myself need this 
on a regular basis. I encourage the rest of you to take some time 
out of your hectii si hcdules and breaihe in some fresh air. 

Okay, so theaii in fort Wayne might not he the freshest, but will 
fall upon us and the 1 tisp air m an nig 11 is nice to just enjoy nature 



and the beauty it has. 

I realize that some things are dying and that [here are not many 
flowers in bloom, if any at all, but the color of the trees and the 
wonders of how they change colors inspires me. There is so much 
variety and randomness to the way they change colors and how 
some trees change color faster while others slower The very fact 
mat our seasons change boggles my mind. 

I understand the principles behind them, but the subtle way 

and gracefulness they change shows such an empowerment 

nature has. To me it is like a perfect ballet orchestrated just for our

basketball season preview 




SCHEDULE ► 



There is .i new coaching stall", the head is ihe \oungest in all 33 1 of the 
NCAA's Division I programs. 

They are [he revamped ll'l-W Mastodons men's basketball program 
ami (heir new t oaeh is former Indiana University defensive siandoul 
Dane Fife. 

The season lupins on Wednesday, Nov ',' in an exhibition match 
against Huntington College at Memorial Coliseum. It ends on 
Wednesday, March I against University of Texas-Pan American at 
the same laciliiv. And somewhere in between, players, coaches, 
fans and IPFW will get a taste ol what I he first - [ ime head coach and 
his players bring to the table. 

Fife was hired by Athletic Director Mark I'ope on March 24 
because, according to Pope, he showed a passion for the IPFW 
head coaching job more than any of the other hundred applicants. 
Pope, the university, and [he fan base are pulling their faith in 
the 25-year-old, who has never had any &lt; oaching experience, (o 
resurrect a struggling program that has suffered through a 26-B9 
record since 2001. 

With a workhorse mentality, file was widely known for his 
defensive prowess ami hustle ai Indiana, trails tie Impes io 
instill in his players. More importantly, he hopes it will lead to a 
turnaround for the program. 

"When you get in a groove of losing, n piles up and wears on 
the players," Fife, a video eonuliiiaior I'm one year under Indiana 
coach Mike Davis, said. "What we need to drjfilft ultimately change 
the mentality. We need to get our kids thinking what winning 
teams think about We jusi have to get them thinking collectively 
like a winning team." 

But that may not be easy, considering he has a group of guys 
that have only played together since the early parts of summer. 

The program returns five players, iwo ol which saw significant 
playing time as starters - guard Quintin Carouihers and forward 
Justin Hawkins. The third is cenier /cljko I geric, who appeared in 
11 games and tallied six points and five rebounds The other two 
are red-shirt guards DeWitt Scott and Brad Ponipe,, who u.instei red 
before the 2004 season began. 

Even more of a challenge will be the 1 1 new faces that will don 

the royal blue and white jerseys this season Si\ are freshman - guards 

Jakari Johnson, D.J. Posley, Kyle Savely, Andy ijtroud and forwards 

Brandon Schumm and Warren Wallace. Ihree big men - Tyler Best, 

Mohamed Esseghir and Armend Ademi - have size and potential, but are 

quite raw in their skills. The two others are Demetrius John 

Nelson, both transfers who will t

Perhaps ihe biggest reason for the subpar 



■.e.i-on by die women's program a year ago was 
the schedule. In put it simply, it was murderous. 
Games at Purdue, Illinois, Utah and others 
contributed to the team never being quite able

lighten up the schedule a little bit this season, 
scattering some tough games within several 
winnable contests. 

"Our schedule is not a cake walk by any

firepower," Patterson said. "Last year, it just 
seemed like every lime we walked into a gym we

Random Rants and Thoughts 



s volleyball Game, 
e of the best times 



Hello again. I will wait to do a detailed analysis of each of the 
men's and women's basketball teams until next week. This week 
I will look into Z0fk"&gt; Homecoming IPFW style and a win-loss 

i ongratnlationsaswell 

Rant #1- 2005 Homecoming 

Now, homecoming is usually lor football games only. While 
everybody here should know that this is one thing we lack dearly 
and I will touch upon later Now. since we are a volleyball school 



the regular 

Now, let's think about this for a second, what real university has 
homecoming the very first game of the regular season?? What is 
there to come home to? A long week oil ('mm practice at home? 

Now, here is what I think, make homecoming when the spring 
t of fun, give students 



something t 
get togethet 
impossible &lt; 



is I hat first week ■ 

do the first week back and make it a total campus 
1 doubt this will ever happen because change 
IPFW. 

i the festivities, last year. I made the best out c 
. We brought in reality "star" Rupert in (I have ti 



bad si 

even tailing him a 

dumb concept and in turn made 

that crap. We probably overpaid him and he c 

BIC razor and a hair cut. He probably drove home to Indianapolis 

laughing his ass off at the easy money we threw at him. I can 

honestly say 1 don't remember a single thing about the game or 

what went on with the Unpen experience. 

This year appears to be different, there is no big name SO to 
speak and the theme is " I he biggest Party Ever' Now. SAB, Alumni 
and the athletic department have a huge pull into what goes on 
this week. I will give some highlight- and lowlights of the week. 



Highlights 

l)Dave and Rac, Friday night after the n 
If you don't know who they are, show up, it's 
you'll have. 

2) Free food, enough said there. 

3) The limmy Buffet Party on Saturday. This could be 
interesting 

4) Pumpkin Drop on a Car. This will either be awesome, or a 
colossal waste of time. 

LowUghts 

1) The freebies this year Kuivy dice, lei's, pillow cases, beads, 
is this Stuff even necessary V bounds like a lot of crap that will get 
thrown in the garbage. 

2) Wacky Olympics. Ibis is outside, the weather in Indiana 
like you know is unpredictable ami it's the middle of November. 
Something dumb is cooking here. 

3) Theme Days. ..Who really is going to dress up in a toga and 
others. I like an idea of having a party tlienie, but just give us good 
Stuff to keep that relates to the day (Saturday is an exception). 

4) The theme alone, "The biggest Party Tver". Now, when I 
think party I think big. I know we can't have alcohol on campus, 
which cuts this down a lot, but we can still make it fun. Three 
bands this year is a step up, but why can't we get a big name 
here? Bring in a comedian lor one night and alter the game bring 
in someone to play a concert I would much rather have money 
spent on something good that is huge, rather than small stuffthat 
is garbage. 

Win-Loss Preview 



ises. This makes eight games | am not sure about. If the team 
eshes, they could win some of these games, but it's a wait and 
e process. 



year. 1 am going to make a shot in the dark and say the w 
team will be 10-18 this year. 

Random Thoughts 

1) I really hale Notre Dame. I hope Weis becomes unsuccessful 
in getting that fat contrai t in match his bellv. I lo's only been there 



2) Speaking of Notre Dame. 1 hope we have more fans rooting 
for IPFW then Notre Dame, ll'd be embarrassing to see a sea of 
green there. 

3)The people who destroyed uurgrc.il sou er held are absolutely 
morons. We have a great little soccer stadium that was abused by 
some bastards mi Halloween Ibis forced the women's soccer team 
to play at the next field, which is still nice, but not the centerpiece. 
Ami speaking ol the women's soccer team.... 

Congratulations 

The women's soccer team captured the United Soccer 
Conference championship Sunday While 1 1 lis gives them no bid to 
the NCAA Tournament, ibis is certainly a good prize for them. So,

position to pick up the motion offense," Coach 
Dane Fife said. "Do we have some good post

That would probably be offensively where we'll 
struggle most and I think defensively, too It looks 
[is if our post players didn't work on the defensive 
end early in their careers."

in no particular order. 

Inside presence: The interior players are raw 
and lack experience. Zeljko Egeric is the lone 
returning big man and has the most experience, 
appearing in |ust 11 games and only taking seven 
shots He onl\ scored si\ points and grabbed five 
rebounds in "all ol the JIJ04 season. Word has it 
that "Z" has improved his game this off-season, 
though.

Indiana. According to I ile. the team has prat (iced 
75 percent of the time on defense This may be 
good and it may not. 

If the Mastodons have spent so much time on 
practicing defense, they should be a solid unit. 
However, practicing that much might mean they 
stink and need more work because they frankly 
aren't that good. 

In any case, it will be discipline and execution 
on both ends - especially the defensive side - that 
will win this leant games. Fife teaches his players 
to fight through screens, dive for loose balls, 
molest defenders and gel downright scrappy. 
Willingly executing those facets of the game will 
turn into wins for IPFW. 

"Our primary focus is getting stops on the 
defensive end,' life said. "We don't have much 
on offense. We've spent 75 percent of our time 
teaching defense Our players are a hit stunned.
