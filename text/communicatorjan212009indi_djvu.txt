he room was hushed, expectant. "We 
mutually pledge to each other our lives, 
our fortunes, and our sacred honor." 



The words sank in, slowly, balancing from its earliest moments to today, 

on a fine apex between Independence The Magna Charta, recognized 

Hall of 1776 and Neff Hall 101 in 2009. as the earliest document to limit the 

What exactly did those words from the power of the throne, was signed in 

Declaration of Independence mean, 1215by theEnglishKingJohn, younger 

mutually pledging to each other these brother of the better-loved Richard the 

lives, fortunes and sacred honor? Lionhearted. 

Today, we have no fear of England. Although this document gave only 



There are no British troops marching 
through the state of New York, closing 
the ports in Boston, lodging in private 
houses or looting homes for 'necessary' 
goods. There is no question about how 
our system of government will function 
without a divinely-appointed king. 
Even the tea tax is gone, although some 
would suggest that other modern fees 
have taken its place. 

But that document 
is still relevant. 
Although the 

circumstances have 
changed over the 
last two centuries, 
we Americans still 
pledge our lives, our 
fortunes, and our 
sacred honor to one 
another in order to 
make this country 
work, whether we 
face an entrenched 
British force or 
overcome terrorists 
who ambush us on 
9/11. 

This sense of 
relevance is what 
The Remnant Trust 
at IPFW is designed 
to illustrate with its 
collection of fifty- 
five documents 
related to the growth 
and development of 
the United States. As 
Chancellor Michael 
Wartell noted in the 
opening ceremony 
on Friday, January 
16, "These are 
documents that 
transformed 
generation and those before us." 

Such documents are presented in 



limited abilities to nobles, it was the 

first major step in the western walk 

towards democratization of the people. 

Because the people held this document 

as such an important tenet of their 

political rights, the Magna Charta was 

re-issued for each of John's successors 

through 1297, when the document 

was made an official parr of the Statute 

Rolls of England. The 

copy on display in the 

Remnant Trust exhibit 

is an illuminated 

manuscript from 

1576. 

Two authors who 
had a tremendous 
impact on the 
formation of American 
democracy were 

Thomas Hobbes and 
John Locke, both of 
whom have books 
displayed in the 
Remnant Trust. The 
first edition of Hobbes 
1651 Leviathan 

focuses on the selfish 
interests of the human 
race and advocates 
a government of 
absolutism, stating 
that a life without 
an all-compassing 
ruler to organize the 
people would be 
'nasty, brutish and 
short'. Locke, on the 
other hand, promotes 
the ideals of personal 
rights and the social 
contract. Noting that 
men are bom with 
certain rights, Locke 
that it is their 
privilege to decide which rights they 
are willing to give up in order for a 
the special Remnant exhibit, located society to work. People enter into an 
in the former twenty-four hour student agreement with their ruler, delineating 
lab at Helmke Library. There, in open the responsibilities of both sides in a 
air for anyone to touch and open, are 'social contract'. If or when the ruler 
actual editions of the Magna Charta, breaks his side of the agreement, the 
a 1776 copy of the Declaration of social contract is then deemed void 
Independence (third edition), an 1863 and the people are allowed to rebel to 
copy of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, create a new government. These ideas 
and a 1731 copy of Wycliffe's New Locke emphasized in his book Two 
Testament, to name a few. Each piece is Treatises of Government. The 1694 
a small part of the puzzle that helps to second edition is on display, 
create the mosaic of the American spirit Locke's thoughts are echoed

nearly verbatim, in the Declaration 
of Independence, which reads: "that 
all men are created equal, that they 
are endowed by their Creator with 
certain unalienable rights, that among 
these are life, liberty and the pursuit 
of happiness." These beliefs about 
equality, endowed rights, and abilities 
are present today, a part of the fabric of 



America that weaves a new strand into 
the pattern with each new generation. 
While the Remnant Trust at IPFW 
will be open only until the end of the 
spring 2009 semester, the thoughts 
contained within the documents and 
papers on display are timeless. It is left 
for us to learn from them and to search 
for the truth in their words.

A challenge for Student Senate to focus on relevant matters 




By Kody lirmel

Most of my 
segments 
tend to be 
positive and por- 



tray IPSGA as a 

ful organization which 

truly helps the student 



Student Body 
Presidential Address 



body. This is not entirely 
untrue; however this week 
I fee! it is my duty to dis- 
play my criticisms of stu- 
dent government at IPFW, 
more specifically relating 
to the Student Senate. 

As many already famil- 
iar with Student Senate 
understand, it can si 
times be extremely frus- 
trating to work with them 
and see things happen. 
The Senate has a reputa 
tion of being stingy and 
too detail-focused. 
fortunately this reputa 



tion has genuine back- 
ing. Most students on 
campus don't quite un- 
derstand what the Sen- 
ate does mainly because 
the Senate doesn't do 
much of anything at all 
that actually affects more 
than the 10 percent of 
students involved with 
activities outside of the 
classroom. This is a ma- 
jor problem. 

The Senate as a whole 
lacks vision, ft does not 
look at the big picture. 
Instead of actively work- 



Do not forget about 
entitlement programs 



By Lee Blum 



Short-term profits, irrespective 
of potential long-term catastrophes, 
have pushed the U.S. economy into 
recession and the financial markets to 
a standstill. In response, the Obama 
administration along with the 111th 
U.S. Congress is designing a stimu- 
lus package in the amount of $800 
billion. While the nearsightedness 
of the financial industry has caused 
this mess, the Obama administration 
must not be so quick as to forget this 
lesson. Spending on health care as 
a whole is currently 16.2 percent of 
GDP. while Medicare alone is approx- 
imately 3.2 percent of GDP. As the 
economy slows, however, expendi- 
tures on health care seem to consume 
an ever-increasing percentage. Medi- 
care, along with the other entitlement 
programs, need serious reform if the 
current economic stimulus package 
and other economic reforms are to 
have any lasting effects. 

Something undoubtedly needs to 
be done in order to salvage the econ- 
omy and employment. The common 
public policy response is to increase 
government spending when con- 
sumer spending and investment has 
declined. While the much discussed 
stimulus package may prove success- 
ful, with its combination of govern- 
ment expenditures and tax cuts, there 
is another crisis looming in the not so 
distant future that all should be wary 
of. it has been projected Medicare will 
become insolvent in the year 2019. 



This comes as die baby boom genera- 
tion retires and unemployment in- 
creases. With the economy currently 
in a downturn, insolvency of entitle- 
ment programs may be expedited, 
especially as the stimulus package 
saddles more debt onto the backs of 
taxpayers and the U.S. government. 

Throughout the early 2000s. then 
Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan 
Greenspan lowered the fed funds tar- 
get rate to a level of one percent in the 
wake pf the dot.com fallout and the 
Sept. 11 attacks. Just as Greenspan 
discovered that it was not so easy to 
reverse previous policy, and for that 
matter to create policy with long-term 
implications in mind, current eco- 
nomic policy must be designed not 
only for the present but for the future. 
Our generation will be dealt the task 
of funding Medicare for current retir- 
ees and it is our generation that runs 
the risk of not receiving any benefits 
from Medicare or Social Security. 

There must be a fundamental 
change in the way our entitlement 
programs are organized, especially 
Medicare. There may be a high prob- 
ability that a slight change in the way 
reimbursements or some other seem- 
ingly minuscule measure are calcu- 
lated can stave off the impending cri- 
sisJThe small probability that, in the 
absence of aggressive and sweeping 
action, there are not enough funds 
to go around for Medicare and Med- 
icaid will wreak havoc. As history has 
illustrated time and again, short-term 
remedies have a way of rearing their 
ugly heads in the intermediate- and 
long-term. 



EntHJemenu andTax Revenues u Percent of Grim Domestic Product 



ing to make changes that 
impact all students, the 
Senate instead focuses 
on things that don't actu- 
ally matter to-most of the 
campus. 

For example, the Sen- 
ate failed to make any 
resolution regarding the 
hody debated imple- 
mentation of the new 
plus/minus grading sys- 
tem. This was a missed 
opportunity that could 
have actually made a dif- 
ference to every student 
currently taking classes 



at IPFW. 

1 am officially chal- 
lenging the Student Sen- 
ate to go above its cur- 
rent mediocre state and 
work towards goals and 
projects that actually 
matter. I am also chal- 
lenging students with a 
vision to join the Senate 
and shake things up for 
the better. For too long 
IPFW students have been 
improperly represented 
in the legislative branch 
of IPSGA. This must 
change.

Opportunity Tax Credit 

to help make college more affordable 



By Jessie Ruckman

Opportunity Tax Credit to help make 
college more affordable 

It's a new dawn in American politics, 
and though 1 hold no public political 
opinion, 1 fully admit that Barack 
Obama's inauguration will likely spark 
change in American policy - and in the 
way Americans spend their money as 
well. 

The current recession has jaded 
Americans and sparked a fear that 
clamped wallets shut. Remember 
though that this spending freeze is only 
temporary - and let's face it: we have 
spent the past few years in a capitalist 
paradise, gobbling up ever)' tangible 
and intangible in sight. 

Now that theballoon has popped, we 
are left with the accumulated junk and 
debt left over from this financial free- 
for-all. Now Americans and President 
Obama are prepared to enter into a 
time of restructuring and strategizing 
for a better tomorrow. 

Now that we are at the bottom of 
the barrel so to speak, we can only look 
up and plan for solid finances next 
year, a decade from now, and upon 
retirement. 

Americans' spending over the past 
decade or so can be likened to the 
holiday season - overindulgence ran 
rampant and we are all now feeling 
the hangover. So, are there lessons to 
be learned from the hangover of past 



decadence and chronic overspending? 
The simple answer is: duh. 
Of course there are ways to improve 
your chances of gaining financial 
independence by capitalizing on the 
current economic situation. The best 
time to begin investing is now, and 
one prime example of how we can take 
this downslide in current American 
policy is in part of Obama's plan to help 
college students by reimbursing some 
of tuition costs. 

According to Obama's website, 
http://barackobama.com, the 

president-elect plans to "make college 
affordable for all Americans by creating 
a new American Opportunity Tax 
Credit. This fully refundable credit 
will provide $4,000 a year for college 
education. It will cover two-thirds the 
cost of tuition at the average public 
college or university." " 

If this promise does end up coming 
to fruition, take full advantage of it. 
That's $4,000 in your studious and 
economically minded pocket. Spend 
that money to pay off some of the 
debt you've accrued in the past, before 
you got so financially savvy. And 
while you're at it, start investing at the 
minimum of 525 per month (stay tuned 
for next week's discussion). 

What is $25 per month anyway, 
really? A case of beer per month that 
could be put to better use - and it could 
also help to preventthat super attractive 
beer gut. See? When investing our 
money wisely, everyone wins.

Texting or 'Sexting' 



By Kelly Mr I endon 

kelty. md e n don 3i pfwcoromu ri iej ! or. or 



The New York Times recently released a 
report that "one in five teens are using cell 
phones to send sexually explicit pictures of 
themselves to others." The advising experts 
from PsychCentral.com say this is happen- 
ing because an "online disinhibition effect" 
now exists. People who wouldn't normally 
verbalize their intentions in face-to-face 
conversation feel more comfortable speci- 
fying the intricacies 
of what they'd like 
to do with another 
person in an online 
or text message 
format. 

The unfortu- 
nate aspect about 
most of these pic- 
ture message ex- 
changes is the fact 
that PsychCentral 
reports that teens 
are more likely to 
"believe that such 
exchanges lead to 
an expectation of 
dating or hooking- 
up," when in ac- 
tuality, they could 
mean nothing. 

Another ad- 
verse aspect is the 
fact that the "on- 
line disinhibition 
effect" can border 



unhealthy. "The disinhibition effect may 
not be so benign. Out spills rude language 
and harsh criticisms, anger, hatred, even 
threats. Or people explore the dark under- 
world of the internet, places of pornography 
and violence, places they would never visit 
in the real world. We might call this toxic 
disinhibition." says John Suler's The Psy- 
chology of Cyberspace. 

Before you take out your phone to send 

lewd pictures or a text that could be thought 

of as vulgar, think twice about who you're 

going to send it 

to. Also, think

Tech Predictions of 2009 include drastic changes 



By Craig Lloyd 

ualg lloydaiplwtomiminitatDf .org 

2008 is long and gone 
and what a year it was. 
Numerous popular video 
games were released, Mi- 
crosoft's first ever oper- 
ating system retired, and 
the world, once again, 
cheated death when the 
Large Hadron Collider 
went live. This year, I've 
made some bold predic- 
tions on what 2009 will 



most likely look like in 
the technology world. 

Facebook will do 
-something drastic. 

Whether it'd be merging 
with a large media com- 
pany or creating a major 
partnership with Google, 
Facebook will do some- 
thing totally shocking 
and unpredictable. They 
will also rapidly continue 
to grow in size and un- 
doubtedly extend their 
lead as the world's largest 



social networking site on 
the web over MySpacc. 

Google will become 
even bigger. They will 
continue to release new 
products to compete 
with Microsoft and vice 
versa. Particularly, die 
Google Chrome internet 
browser will maintain 
its battle with Internet 
Explorer, as well as Mi- 
crosoft releasing web 
services to compete with 
Google's already large 



collection. 

As inuch as I dream of 
Apple failing miserably, it 
will not happen anytime 
in the near future. CEO 
Steve Jobs' medical leave 
of absence will not af- 
fect Apple by any means. 
However, there comes a 
certain point when be- 
ing cooler than the other 
guy just doesn't go any 
further. Apple will get to 
that point within the next 
few years. 



2009 will be the year 
of mobility, especially 
web-integrated mobil- 
ity. Palm, a mobile de- 
vice manufacturer, was a 
huge hit at the 2009 Com- 
puter Electronics Show a 
couple weeks ago. They 
showed off some of their 
newest products, and 
1 have to say, they look 
very promising. 

Despite the negative 
remarks about Blu-Ray 
after its triumphant win 



over HD-DVD last year, 
Sony's high-def format 
will take off in 2009. 

Blu-Ray players are 
becoming more afford- 
able and movie rental 
services like Netflix and 
Blockbuster are already 
stocking up on Blu-Ray 
movies. The Dark Knight 
alone has sold over 1.7 
million Blu-Ray copies. 
Overall, high definition 
television will become 
more popular.

Top 10 reason cats are way better 
than all the other animals: 

10. A cat will always land on her feet; a snake will never land on her 
feet. 

9. A cat will jump In your lap and keep you warm while you sip green 
tea on a cold winter's night; an alpha male chimp will rip off a limb 
to show his dominance. 

8. A cat will not bump its head into your ceiling causing $366.64 In 
damage; a giraffe will. 

7. A cat will snuggle against your feet while you prepare a hot bath 
for yourself; a goldfish will swim around for a six months until It 
dies and you notice it four days later covered in mold. 

6. A cat won't siobber all over your face; a dog . . . 

5. A cat will not pry into your political life and ask you who you 
voted for; an owl will keep asking, who? who? who? 

4. A cat will sleep on your belly while you watch reruns of "The Nan- 
ny" before going to bed; a parrot will just mock everything you say in 
that annoying high pitched parrot voice. 

3. A cat's eyes will mesmerize you when It peers at you in the dark; a 
bat's eyes. . .haha a bat does not even have eyes. Stupid bats. Stupid 
ugly eyeless bats. 

2. A cat won't strut around all arrogant like, 'wow look me, look at 
all my extra legs;' a tarantula will.

will bite off your ear and regurgitate It Into her hatchllngs mouths.

The IPFW Department of Theatre is holding au- 
ditions for ten actors for the upcoming Spring 2009 
play entitled The Diviners. 

The play is about a Buddy Layman, 
a Zion, Indiana native. 

Buddy is the idiot of a town with a 
gift for divining water, but also has an 
intense fear of water after his mother 
died from drowning while saving him 
from the same fate. 

When a preacher comes into town 
one day for no reason, he connects 
with Buddy in a way nobody has before 
and tries to help him overcome his hydrophobia and 
the memories of his mother's death. 

The auditions will be taking place on Sunday, Ian.

First Lady Fashion; Focus for Stylists 



By Kelly McLendon 

ktUyjnrJendonWpfwDDnununlular.Dri 

For the past few weeks, 
fashion magazines have 
spent their time trying 
to figure out where the 
new First Lady, Michelle 
Obama, shops. They have 
searched for her favor- 
ite designers and sought 
out her preferred shops 
in Chicago. One of those 
shops, The Maria Pinto 
Collection, has been the 
subject of recent articles. 
When Barack Obama an- 
nounced his candidacy, 
his wife was wearing a 
dress designed by Ma- 
ria Pinto, the collection's 
creator. Mrs. Obama also 
woreabluedress designed 
by Pinto at the Democrat- 
ic convention. By wearing 
Pinto's designs, Obama 
has put the collection on 
the map for fashion gurus 
and stylists everywhere. 

How does Michelle 
Obama measure up to the 
other first lady fashionis- 
tas? Some designers have 
compared her with lackie 
Kennedy Onassis for her 
style choices. Onassis was 
famous for her well-tai- 
lored suits in eye-catching 



colors like pink; as well as 
introducing the wide tank 
sleeve dress and big sun- 
glasses. Today, celebrities 
like Victoria Beckham are 
bringing back Onassis's 
fashion sense with large, 
wide-rimmed black sun- 
glasses. Onassis was the 
original First Lady pio- 
neer for fashion. 

"She liked wearing 
jeans years before it was 
even fashionable," Savvy 
Magazine writer Pat Ja- 
cobs said of Onassis. 

Then, Hilary Clinton 
is the antithesis of Onas- 
sis. Glamour ran a feature 
this year about Clinton's 
pan (suits in every col- 
or—from salmon to steel 
colored. She was also un- 
lucky enough to be cited 
as having, "kankles." Ac- 
cording to Urban Diction- 
ary, kankles "are the ab- 
sence of ankles, the legs 
just flow into the foot." 

On Late Night with 
Conan O'Brien, Project 
Runway guru Tim Gunn 
said Clinton often dresses 
gender confused. 

"She's so mannish in 

her dress, and I believe the 

suits are probably made 

out of Kevlar," Gunn said. 

■ 




"I just don't get it." 

Making fun of her own 
years of bad dressing, 
Clinton will feature sev- 
eral of her worst outfits, 
and her accompanying 
comments, in the Febru- 
ary 18 Issue of US Weekly. 
Overall, Clinton's career in 
politics has been supple- 
mented by rather unfash- 
ionable getup. 

The fashion of former 
First Lady, Laura Bush, 



proved to be nothing spe- 
cial, either. Bush main- 
tained a demure, school- 
teacher look throughout 
her husband's prolific 
presidency, and mirrored 
Clinton with the pantsuit 
obsession. Bush also com- 
mitted a supposed fash- 
ion flop at a White House 
Christmas Parry a few 
years ago. where she wore 
an $8,500 Oscar dc la Ren- 
ta red dress. The Hop hap- 



pened when three other 
women showed up at the 
party wearing the same 
dress. Not be upstaged, 
she changed her outfit. 
The First Lady cannot be 
seen wearing something 
everybody else can easily 
acquire, can she? 

"At long last, she has 
stopped pretending diat 
she is just like you, your 
mother and the folks back 
in Midland," The Wash- 



ington Post said. 

With Michelle Obama 
now in the Whitehouse as 
official First Lady, citizens 
can look past the prob- 
lems of Laura Bush and 
Hillary Clinton. First.there 
will be no more pantsuits 
(hopefully). There will be 
no more schoolteacher 
sweaters with apples 
sewn on them, either. In- 
stead, there will be style. 
And plenty of it. 



Growing young with Brad Pitt 



By Abigail Kopen 

ai Igj M . kn p» nS I pfwto mm u ni lalo r. d rg 

The Curious Case of 
Benjamin Button is a re- 
markable siory of a boy 
who ages in reverse (Brad 
Pitt) with the mind of a 
newborn, but a body of an 
80 year old man complete 
with arthritis, cataracts 
and loss of skin elasticity. 

It is based offof a short 
story by F Scott Fitzger- 
ald, but parallels a book 
by Andrew Sean Greer 
called "The Confessions 
of Max Tivoli" that was 
published in 2004. 

As the story moves 
you see Benjamin age yet 
grow young at the same 
time. Through trials and 
triumphs, loss of life and 
new life to come, one 
thing stays the same; his 
love for a young wom- 
an named Daisy (Cate 
Blanchett). 

After meeting Daisy 
roughly around the age 
of five, it is "love at first 
sight" and fate brings 
them together over and 
over again. 

The characters that 
bring this story to life are 
vivid and unforgettable, 



from an elderly woman ence ask, "Why not find British equivalent of the 



who teaches Benjamin 
how to play the piano to 
an Irish tug boat captain 
who teaches Benjamin 
about the world of wom- 
en and life at sea. 

This is a story that 
reminds us why 
we lose the ones 
we love and that 
time is never to be 
wasted. For such 
an unrealistic plot, 
the emotions that 
it extracts through 
such raw depic- 
tions of what it 
means to long for 
someone, as well 
as the depression 
that can many 
times follow the 
loss of youth, are 
something quite 
extraordinary. 
Many of us lay out 
our goals for love 
as simply finding 
someone to grow 
old with, but may- 
be we are looking 
at it the wrong way.

It is no wonder 
the film swept up 
the visual effects

movies tend to do 
a fine job of mak-

another thing to

Alumnus Exhibit in Visual Arts Building 

Former IPFW student displays latest artwork for all to see 




Tim Brumbeloe is a former IPFW student that has 
recently moved some of his work into the gallery of 
the Visual Arts building that is also cur- 
rently housing works from fellow Fort 
Wayne photographers Rob Borel and 
lim Gabbard. 

What shocked me most about some 
of Tim's work was his series entitled 
"Pentimento". 

On first glance, the photos look like 
well-composed Italy street scenes, but 
after speaking with Brumbeloe, he ex- 
plained how none of the shots actually 
exist. Each picture is pieced together 
from dozens and dozens of different 
places while he randomly shot the Ital- 
ian cities, The large print in the gallery 
on the left wall is a perfect example of a 
work from such series. 

He also spoke about his recent ex- 




perimentations of printing his photographs on to can- 
vas papers, to give the picture a more realistic look. 

His series "From the Hip" is also featured in the ex- 
hibit and as the title implies, his photos are shot from 
the hip. While touring Italy, Brumbeloe would keep a 
small point-and-shoot camera with 
him, and basically just bring it out and 
take shots at random, without framing 
or composition. The end result is an in- 
credibly intimate view of Italy and it's 
inhabitants. 

Ironically many of the people pho- 
tographed had no knowledge that they 
were being photographed. His work 
from these and other series can be 
found on his website at www.brumbe- 
loefineart.com in addition to the prints 
that can be seen in the gallery of the Vi- 
sual Arts building. 

Brumbeloe currently owns and op- 
erates his own studio and gallery in 
downtown Fort Wayne at 1301 Lafay- 
ette Street.

Wayne, more bands, more 
everything." 

Shewentontodescribe 
how her independence 
was compromised by liv- 
ing in the BSU dorms, and 
how the apartment style 
living of the IPFW student 
housing gives her the 
independence that she 
thrives on. 

Von first discovered 
her love of photography 



during an English class 
at BSU. where she was 
assigned to take pictures 
of Muncie landmarks in 
a collaborative effort to 
build a city map. Von first 
started exploring the art 
by shooting objects in 
nature, and then a friend 
asked her to take pictures 
of his band at a show. 

Although she enjoys 
capturing the local mu- 
sic scene on film, her real 
passion lays in fashion 
photography. 

"I think it would be 
amazing to the work for 
a fashion magazine some 
day, but right now I'm just 
learning." 

Her ultimate goal is to 
own a shop selling art, and 
do freelance photography 
on die side. For now, she 
is just buildingher portfo- 
lio, and learning through 
experience. 

Ali Pickard, one of 
Von's models said, "I have 
done professional shoots 
and her's wasn't any dif- 
ferent. She is fun and 
knows exactly what she 
wants without question. 
Most of her ideas reflect 
her personality and if they 
don't, they compliment 
her well."

7 Uses 

Besides 

Rachel Rossiter Smith 



for Old Jeans 

Wearing Them 



ECONOMICS 101: 



[f you're like me, you 
have a closet full of those 
"when I lose weight" 
jeans, "they don't fit 
right" jeans, "what was 
I thinking" jeans, and 
"working in the yard" 
jeans. At some point, 
you know you'll have to 
do something with them, 
but you don't want to 
throw them out. Here are 
seven things to do with all 
those old blue jeans that 
will reduce the amount 
of waste thrown out at 
the end of the drive way 
and make anyone look 
like the thriftiest person 
in Fort Wayne. 

1. Make a purse. By 
cutting off the legs of old 
blue jeans, sewing the 
bottom closed and using 
some of the extra material 
to make a strap, you'll 
make a nifty cany-all. 
It even comes complete 
with a packet. 

2. Turn them into a 
quilt. If you have enough 
old jeans ( I know I do), 
you can cut them into 



quilt squares and sew 
them together. Throw 
in some batting and 
backing, and you've got 
warm memories of your 
favorite jeans that will 
really keep you warm. 

3. Make paper out of 
them. Yes, I am serious. 
Cut your jeans into small 
strips and put a few at a 
time into a blender with 
lots of water and process 
until smooth. Pour the 
pulpy mixture into a bin 
large enough to fit your 
framed piece of window 
screen material. Dip it in 
to capture a thin layer, 
plop it out onto a towel 
to let dry. You'll end up 
with a notable piece of 
denim paper. 

4. Make a no-sew 
backpack. Take some 
twine, hemp or thin rope 
and tie the legs off at the 
desired length. 

Bring the ankle cuffs 
around to the back, and 
poke them each through 
a belt loop. Fold the 
ankles back onto the leg 
and tie them off, being 
sure to make fitting 
adjustments at this time. 



A bit more hemp laced 
through all the belt loops 
for a drawstring, and you 
can still get many more 
miles from your old 
blues. 

5. Get in touch with 
your inner artist. Your 
imagination is the limit. 
Get creative. 

6. Donate them. 
The Salvation Army and 
Goodwill are two good 
places, but so are school 
clothes pantries, the 
Franciscan Center and 
needy people in your 
community. When that 
S50 pair of jeans doesn't 
float your boat anymore, 
give them to someone 
who can put them to use. 
Recycling at its finest. 

7. Chew toys. My 
puppy used to love to bite 
at my jean ankles to the 
point that, soon, that was 
all they were good for. If 
your jeans have really 
worn out their welcome 
and are too battered to 
be donated, cut the legs 
off and tie big knots at 
each end. You'll have 
tons of fun with your 
favorite four-legged.

Fashion Representing Solidarity 

The Hatta, a Palestinian statement 



Hana Hawash 

ha n ,i h.i ms h3 ip Iw roiran uni t,i i o r.o rg 

As I walk around campus 
or the mall or look at pictures 
of movie stars, T see everyone 
wearing scarves known to 
most as mufflers. 

Though there are many 
varied patterns, the most 
popular is a sort of two toned 
checkered print similar to 
houndstooth. They are very 
stylish and are the warmest 
version of a scarf anyone 
can wear. 

But where did these 
mufflers come from? We 
always wonder who really 
started a particular trend 
or style, but we hardly ever 
come by the answer. Well, 
today I am here to explain 
where this type of scarf came 
from. 

The true name for these 
scarves is "Hatta {hut-uh)" 
or"Kuffiyah (koo-fy-eh)." 

They originally come 
from Palestine. Hattas are a 
large square shaped piece of 
woven fabric that is folded 
into a triangle and wrapped 
around the head or the neck; 
women even tied them 
around their hips as a sash 
while belly dancing. 

These days, they are 
being made in pretty much 
any color from orange to 
purple, but hattas were 
originally either black/white 
erred/white. 

Older or very traditional 
Palestinian men still wear 
hattas as a sign of their 
culture. The original reason 




that everyone in Palestine 
started wearing them was as 
a sign of solidarity. 

In the early 1900s when 
the British were occupying 
many Middle Eastern 
countries, Palestine fought 
back 

Since the resistance 
fighters were easily 
recognized by their hattas, 
any person wearing one 
was arrested by the British 
to stop the resistance. 
Palestinian men from 
town began to wear the 
hatta and stop carrying 
their identification cards 
so that the fighters could 
not be easily exposed. This 
showed huge support for the 
Palestinian resistance. 

The hattas popularity 
was once again renewed in 
the 1960s in response to the 



1967 invasion of Gaza and 
the West Bank by Israel. In 
more recent years, the hatta 
was made very popular by 
the Palestinian president 
Yassir Arafat, who wore it 
draped around his head 
in the shape of historic 
Palestine throughout his 
presidency. 

Palestinians have always 
endured occupation and 
war and their struggle is 
an inspiration to many. 
Eventually the hatta started 
being worn by almost all 
middle eastern countries in 
times of war and struggle. 
Women and men both 
young and old continue to 
wear hattas to show their 
pride and support of their 
country both in Palestine 
as well as in America and in 
Europe.

Going GREEN and Sticking To It 



By Abigail Kopen 

a bl ga ii.kopc n H ip Iwcomm un i calor.o ig 

There are still many things 
that people could be doing if 
they want to decrease the impact 
of their own carbon footprint 
left on this earth. Helping the 
environment is really not all that 
difficult. 

Rachel Smith, a naturalist 
at the Allen County Parks 
and Recreation Center is also 
a student here at IPFW. She 
proposes that the road to making 
a difference is never ending. 

"I reduce the amount that t 
purchase, the amount I throw 
away, the time spent driving, 
etc," Smith said. 

At vrtvw.in.gov/recycle 

there is plenty of information 
and helpful tips to guide those 
who care about mother earth. 
Through the Indiana Recycling 
Locations searchable database, 
one can be directed towards all 
the areas and locations close to 
home that recycle. There are also 
lists of places to find recycled 



products and even information 
on how to safely recycle difficult 
materials like electronics and 
batteries. 

Besides looking for things just 
in Indiana, the environmental 
protection agency has a website 
at www.epa.gov that provides 
tips on how to live a greener 
lifestyle. 

Some of these tips include 
. using fluorescent light bulbs, 
which cost more in the store 
but last longer and use less 
electricity. There are even tips 
on how to gel involved at school, 
work and in the community. 
Allen County provides a website 
called ACwastewatcher.com 
that concentrates solely on Allen 
County solid waste management 
to make things easier. 

The three R's (reduce, reuse 
and recycle) are shown to save 
money and the environment, 
and although it takes a little bit 
of extra effort than just tossing 
things in the trash, many would 
argue that it is a small price to 
pay for the safety of our planet.

Hot-shooting Kangas hits for career best 39 




Eric Kangas was unstoppable Saturday 
as Oakland shot past 1PFW 93-88. 

The senior guard from DeVVitt, 
Michigan torched his previous career high 
of 28 by hitting eight of 13 three pointers 
and going a near perfect 5-of-6 from the 
free throw line. 

"He really had it going tonight," 
Oakland head coach Greg Kampe said 
after the game 

The tiling that 1 like is he was really 
looking for it. We put a few things in for 
him, and he really liked the new things we 
put in for him." 

Kangas just missed the remarkable 



40-point plateau by missing the front 
end of two free throws with five seconds 
remaining in the game. 

"I kind of mad about it. I really wanted 
it, but a win is a win," Kangas said. 

The game-started positive for Oakland 
on a first possession alley-oop from 
Jonathan Jones to Keith Benson. And 
even with Jones' 20 and Will Hudson's 16, 
the night belonged to Kangas. 

"I kind of had it going. It was one of 
those nights where the basket was big 
and everything out of my hand felt good," 
Kangas noted after the game. 

hot hand is nothing new for 



Oakland, who went their 614th straight 
game hitting at least one three- pointer. 
Only UNLY Vanderbilt, Kentucky, Duke, 
Arkansas and Western Kentucky have 
longer active streaks. 

IPFW also was strong deep, hitting 14 
threes as a team. 

"We played zone, we played man, 
we contested threes and they just keep 
making them," Kampe said. 

Kangas moved into eighth all-time in 
league history with 279 treys and tied his 
best single game total. Jones pushed his 
career assist total to 426, moving up the 
league's all-time list to 15th. 



Carson revels in jeers 




IPFW senior, former Oakland Grizzlie takes crowd in stride, 
helps IPFW to near upset win over growing conference foe 



Photo by Lucas Carter 

THE BAD GUY?: Senior David Carson is mugged by a pair of Oakland 
defenders. Carson says he revels in being the villain on the court. 



By Dan Vance 



Two years ago, David Carson 
transferred to IPFW from the 
University of Oakland. 

And don't you forget it. The 
Oakland fans sure don't. • 

StartinglastyearwhentheGrizzlies 
visited IPFW, in a losing effort, Carson 
has been showered with jeers and 
chants of "traitor." 

"I definitely enjoy them and know 
it's all a part of the game," Carson said. 
"1 enjoy being the villain, for lack of a 
better word, in any game though." 

Villian is a strong word, but as 
Carson says, it is a role he is more than 
happy taking on, one that he doesn't 
mind being for the rest of the season. 

"We have to take on an us against 
the world approach if we are going 
to be successful from here on in," 
Carson said. 

The approach is in part due to 
IPFW's cold shooting through much 
of early conference season that has 
left them with a 2-5 start. 

Oakland is now 4-3 in conference. 

That roughstartbegan to evaporate 
yesterday as they shot 58.2 percent 
from the field. But other issues sprung 
up, slowing the Mastodons in the 93- 
88 loss. 

"Us not being able to get big 
defensive stops and rebounds really 
plagued us throughout the. night," 
Carson noted. 

For Carson, jeers aside, he doesn't 
feel that he really needs to perform 
any better against Oakland than any 



other team, despite his history with 
the program. 

"I wouldnt say its an added 
emphasis to perform personally, 
because I feel I have proved what I can 
do. But there is an added pressure for 
us to win because of the competitor 
lam." 

Carson scored nine early points, 
dissapeared mid-game and came on 
strong late to finish with 21 points 
and five rebounds. 

Better yet, Carson found a stroke 
from deep, hitting on 3-of-6 three 
pointers. Previously this season, he 
had hit just 12-of-37 shots from deep. 

Now Carson must take his 
villianous attitude to the next level as 
the Mastodons host Western Illinois 
and 1UPUI in crucial Summit League 
games. 

Right now, IPFW is in a three- 
way tie for 8th place in the 10 team 
conference, but only the top eight 
teams will make the Summit League 
Tournament. IUPUI is one of the 
teams tied in 8th. 

"We are in a must win situation 
right now. We have to right the ship 
immediately and make a push for the 
tournament," Carson said. 

Carson leads the team with 14.8 
points per game and led the team in 
scoring on ten different occassions. 
He also averages 5.6 rebounds. Only 
DelivezYearby rebounds more. 

In addition to Carson's ties 
between the two programs, Oakland's 
associate head coach Jeff Tungate, 
was the first hire of Dane Fife at 
IPFW and spent two seasons with the 
Mastodons.

Duckworth's emergence spells good things 

■ Could the former redshirt be the leading man in the rebuild, rather than just an extra as the 2009 season kicks into full gear? 
In All Directions - OpEd 



By Dan Vance 

vance-iad.blogspot.ci 



Even as late as The Communicator's pre-break 
men's volleyball preview, the emphasis on offense 
was Darryl Shank. 

He had the most experience, the coach's backing 
and was anointed as the go-to-guy at the hitter 
position. 

And then something happened. Puerto Rico-Rio 
Piedras came to town and sophomore Ben Duckworth 
exploded. 

Not to say that Shank didn't do his part, he 
played very strong and will likely continue to do so 
throughout his sophomore season. 

But Duckworth was masterful, leading the team in 
kills both nights and shocking the Roosters in the first 
match with nine aces from the service line. It broke 
the previous record of seven shared by Scott Lane 
(2000), Matt Zbyszewski (2004) and Brock Ullrich 
(2007). 

As impressive as his offensive stats are leading 
the Mastodons, Duckworth is also right there on the 
defensive end with 2.5 blocks and a second-ranked 
10 digs, where he trails just libero Matt Pliske. 

If Duckworth continues to do what he started 
doing, Shank continues to live up to the hype that 
Amie Ball has laid down and a few more things fall 
into place, this rebuild could be highly successful. 

I hate to always go to the well and talk about 
the past, but Ball found a very solid formula in the 
most recent Final Four team that this team very well 
could be molded successfully into by the time the 
underclassmen graduate in 201 1 and 2012. 



In the trips to the Final Four, Ball had three very 
reliable hitters. Now, implant Shank, Duckworth 
and freshman Phil Peterson, who Ball believes could 
become the best player in the MIVA by his senior 
year, in place of Ullrich, CI Macias and lason Yhost. 

Sophomore libero Patrick Pinto is highly touted, 
as is freshman setter Dan Mader- maybe even in the 
form of Final Four leaders Pliske, Mike Morici and 
former setter Colin Lundeen. 

The formula has not changed and the path to a 
successful sequel seems to be pretty clear if these guys 
continue to improve. 

Yes, it is far too early ^tttt 

to predict a Final Four "SC*^ * * — ' 
run for any season, 
especially two years 



Kills: Duckworth 
Blocks: Kook- 5 
Assists: Mader - 49 
Digs: Pliske- 11 
Aces: Duckworth - 9 




down the road, but I 
am so far impressed. 

And in my 
mind, after opening 
weekend, Duckworth 
is the catalyst to that 
possibility. 

His successful production frees up Shank from 
defenses and vice-versa, making IPFW far from a 
one-pony show. 

For me, as a close follower of this program, and 
even more so for the casual fan, you never really know 
what to expect from a guy who sits out his first year as 
a redshirt, especially when they don't play much as a 
freshman the following year. 

There are the good and there are the bad. Ben 
Duckworth is the good. And his emergence as IPFW's 
go-to-guy. or even just one of them, will make all of LEADER: Ben Duckworth (1 4), Daryl Shank (6) 
the difference in the world. Look out MIVA, IPFW and Matt Pliske (2) celebrate one of the hitter 
may have just found a new leading man. Duckworth's 30 opening weekend kills.

Oakland's interior play 
too much for women 



Jessica Pike scored a 
game-high 18 points to 
lead a superior inside 
game for the Oakland 
Grizzlies' 79-64 win last 
Saturday afternoon. 

Oakland outscored 
the Mastodons 48-12 
in the paint and pulled 
down 43 rebounds to 
IPFW's 26 in the win. 

Three other Grizzlies 
scored in double-digits 
ted by 16 each from 
Melissa Jeltema and 
April Kidd. Jeltema and 
Kidd also led Oakland 
in rebounding with 
nine and eight boards 
respectively. Brittany 
Camago added 10 
points. 

"I was very happy 
with our patience and 
shot selection," said 
Oakland head coach 
Beckie Francis. "We 
had a couple turnovers 
early. After that we 
setded down, we got our 
shooters the ball, and 
our defense took care of 
business. Getting some 
easy buckets and some 
fast breaks certainly 
helped." 

IPFW got 16 points 
from Courtney Reed and 
14 from Anne Boese, but 
never got closer than 13 
points after trailing by
