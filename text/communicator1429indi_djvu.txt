It's easy— when you finish with your books, you 
Irade them in for cash! Then turn it into a down 
stroke on some new stereo gear. 

Whether it's enough for a system or just a new LP 
depends on how many books you've got to sell, 
what condition they're in. and whether or not there's 
a need for them nationwide 

Whatever you wanl to use the money for it will

THE FORT 

When 1 started with ARA in August 1982. they told me 
that the students had discriminating tastes and that It would 
be a challenge to please everyone We In the cafeteria 
tried to provide variety and quality, increasing portions at 
as low a price as possible We eliminated the use of soy liller 
products and replaced them with 100% U.S. DA. choice 
meat. 

As the year comes to a close, we in The Fort wish to thanh 
all the members of the Administration, faculty and most of 
all the fabulous student body that supported us this pas) year 



try harder next year. 



Thanks, 
Gene Hadl and Crew 
The Gang at The Fort
