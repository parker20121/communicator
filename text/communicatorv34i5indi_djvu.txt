WebCT: Online but still a little off? 



WebCT may be the future of 
education, but there are still come 
kinks to be worked out. 

Samantha Birk. an instruction- 
al designer for the Center for the 
Enhancement of Learning and 
Teaching (CELT), said the purpose 
of WebCT is to support teaching 
and learning - as well as to facili- 
tate distance education. 

She estimates between 8,000 
and 9,000 students are in WebCT 
classes or classes that have a 
WebCT component. 

WebCT offers many things to 
IPFW students, both those who 
attend classes on campus and those 
who prefer the non-traditional 
method of obtaining an education. 

"It is a tremendously helpful 
tool in delivering a wide variety of 
content to a diverse group of stu- 
dents," said Economics Professor

It is also up to the instructor to 
decide if they want the class to 
have a scheduled time, Birk noted.

"Flexible scheduling makes 
taking these courses convenient, 
especially for those students who 
work full-time and have families," 
Vitz said. 

One of the advantages of 
WebCT Bullion sees is being able to 
get the message to students. 

"It has made the task of deliv- 
ering content to a broad range of 
distance education students -- as 
well as on-campus students -- man- 
ageable," Bullion said.

Professor of Communication, said, 
"WebCT does provide a central

students access to material restrict-

'That will never happen to me' 



IPFW student 
recalls her rape 



Heidi remembers telling her 
friend's fiance she didn't want him 
touching her. She verbally denied 
him more than once, but intoxica- 
tion left her vulnerable. 

She passed out- Heidi woke up 
naked aside from her socks on her 
feet. Disconcerted, she went to the 
bathroom. 

"There's this condom still inside of 
me. I didn't know what to do. I 
wasn't thinking straight because I 
was drunk," she says. 

Spring break had just started. 
She had just celebrated a birth- 
She had just been raped by an 
acquaintance. 

"Driving home, I didn't know 
what to think. I was confused. I 
was confused about how to feel, I 
was confused about being con- 
fused," she says. 

She wondered if she led him on. 
She wondered why she went to his 
place. She wondered why he didn't 
stop when she said no. 

"It's an old saying. That will 
never happen to me,'" she says. 




She claims the night started 
when her friend's fiance — a guy 
she thought was nice with a lot of

Investigation into construction underway

Editorial 

Thanks for the advantage 

Don Willis and Ins family have helped out the school tremen- 
dously with their donation of $3 million last week. 

There is no way as a student body or a campus to say "Thank 
You " enough for the generous philanthropy, As a newspaper, we'd 
like to start by saying "Thanks" -■ and then apologizing for 
misidentifying him as "Don Harris" several times in last week's 
article. 

We at The Communicator should probably wait a few months 
and atone before requesting any of the unrestricted $1 million. 

Willis could easily have kept these funds to spend himself or 
within his own family. He could have designated it strictly for his 
interests on campus or a few pel projects. 

Instead, he sought to expand the betterment of IPFW as a 
whole. Willis sees Fort Wayne and our campus as members of his 
extended family - and believes in its future. To that end, he wants 
to — and is giving - an advantage to even/one working or attend- 
ing classes here. His financial gift will directly help all of us. Not Don wi,lis hel P s IPFW 
only through scholarships and other assistance, but also by loosening up economic funding that has 
been constricted in recent years. 

Willis gave IPFW $3 million to divide between three funding structures: $1 million for the 
Chair of Entrepreneurs/lip; $1 million for scholarships to be shared between business, education and 
music students; and $1 million "unrestricted." That money is to help IPFW any way it is needed. 

Willis said it is the goal of his family that "Fort Wayne becomes a -world class center for educa- 
tion excellence. " It is a laudable goal that may take a few more generations, but he and his family 
have given a commendable advantage and helping hand toward that objective. 

Children led the crowd across the Willis Family Bridge Tuesday, and the Willis family donation 
may be helping future generations of those children as well. 

Editorial 

Burnt bridges, raised questions 

On the day IPFW was dedicating a bridge, the Nexus-Sentinel seemed to want to burn some of 
theirs. 

They reported an important story. The Indiana Department of Labor has launched an investiga- 
tion into wages paid to IPFW student housing construction workers. The newspaper went to great 
length with tin* story, quoting several sources on different sides of the issue. It 's a story that appears 
to have taken several days to compose. 

But they did not quote one IPFW source. They did not quote one Purdue official. Their only 
comment was IPFW officials couldn't be reached Monday. Not one chancellor, project manager, 
attorney or groundskeeper could be reached Monday - a day before thni iqipaivntly wanted to run 
the story. 

The day the Willis Family Bridge was dedicated. 

It is only because of that reason the story is lazy. 

Othenvise. it raises some very serious questions about wages being paid to construction 'workers 
at the IPFW student housing site. Officials with IPFW and Purdue should come fonoard to answer 
questions quickly and clearly. 

It is possible the school has nothing to do with this aspect of the project. But - especially at a 
university where social justice is a bellowing call from generations - toe are responsible for zohat 
takes place here. Othenvise, all the other movements students and universities stand up for come off 
as hypocritical. 

It is also possible that an accusation without merit has been made. Because of that, the Neivs- 
Sentinel should have had the journalistic fortitude to hold the story until they had a comment from 
an IPFW official, even if the comment was "no comment. " 

Instead, it comes across as a cheap shot at an expensive price. They mist the innuendo IPFW is 
involved in a type of labor wrongdoing, but they don 't let the campus respond. 



Corrections 



The lead story about Don 
Willis' donation of $3 mil' 
lion to the university incor 
rectly identified Willis a; 
"Harris" several times. We 
apologize for the error. 

A news brief on Miss IPFW 
as omitted and instead a 
story on "Relationships 101" 
was repeated. A story on 
Miss IPFW appears in this 
edition. 




Is your life running you? 

By Debbie Dambra 
Managing Editor 

In reviewing my calendar for the rest of 2003, I do not have 
a day devoid of activities through December 31, 2003. There are 
\chool days on top of my regular work days. There are days 
where I've volunteered for non-profit organizations. There are 
iays to see my children's games, my children's parent/teacher 
meetings, my children's dance recitals and/or plays and musi- 
:ats. There are days my dogs need to see the vet. There are 
days when my family has appointments for doctors, dentists, 
hair, nails and massages. 

There are days filled with social obligations, you know, 
birthday celebrations, baby shoivers, weddings, anniversary 
gatherings, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Neiv Year's Eve. There 

date nights" with my husband, as well as bowling nights 
and church obligations. 

Am I alone in my "activity stacking?" Does anyone else 
out there feel stressed to the max? 

In speaking to other students, I hear stories of four jobs, 12 
credit hour semesters and students driving an hour to get to 
campus in the rain or snow or sleet daily. Yes, daily. Yes, one 
student. 

Or students who have small children and have alternating 
schedules with family "day care" services while they are work- 
ing and going to school. What about students driving cars that 
may or may not get to campus each day or students who may 
may not get their daily assignments done and turned in 
schedule all because of their "activity stacking." 

We all deserve "time off, " but somehow short ourselves time 
devoted to ourselves alone. Or time to do nothing. Of cm 
perhaps, "time off" is when we sleep . . . maybe 4 to 5 hours 
a night. 

This week's challenge is find time for you. Get your daily 
calendar out and pencil some time in for you, even if you have to 
take it five minutes at a time. Continue to work towards getting 
more time each day for you. Let go of activities that are just 
"fillers" for the more important events in your daily life. Pace 
yourself, don 7 push yourself. A balanced life is a better lift 

Take control of living your life or your life will control yc

West Nile claims a 
Fort Wayne victim 



The West Nile virus has killed a Fort 
Wayne resident who lives less than a mile 
from IPFW. 

Tom Wagstaff, 79, of the 1800 block of 
Vance Avenue died Sept. 14, according to his 
daughter Susan Harmeyer. 

His death was the first confirmed West 
Nile fatality of the year in Indiana, although 
his daughter 
wonders if 

going misdi- 
agnosed. 

Wagstaff 
had gone to 
medical offi- 
cials less than 
a month ago 

about flu-like 
symptoms, but was told t 



"I don't think people 
take it seriously. 
They don't realize 
how insidious this 
disease is. " 



a that hiscondi- 



likely West Nile. 

Harmeyer felt it should be a concern 
since her father spent a lot of time in his yard, 
and had been constructing a patio. He had 
not recently left the area. 

"I finally was at the point when I said: 
'Humor me. Test him for it.' Well, guess 
what?" Harmeyer said. 

She said it only took three and a half 
weeks before he died. 

"It's a horrible process to watch. He 
walked into the hospital on his own steam. 
Talked lo them. Within 24 hours, he was in a 
coma and never recovered," she explained. 

Harmeyer said her father's symptoms 
may not have been completely consistent 
with what medical officials are looking for. 



but it was West Nile. 

She and her family knew it wasn't just a 
flu bug- Wagstaff had dealt with bacterial 
meningitis when he was younger, and felt 
the symptoms were similar. He was "racked" 
with pain in his head, and his body was 
shaking uncontroll.ihlv, hi-, d.mghter said. 

He had a check-up six weeks before, she 
said. 

"He was a very healthy man," she said. 
"He could run loops around 20-year-olds," 
Harmeyer added. 

Watching the ailment take its course on 
her father has left her burdened. 

"I've always been outside a lot — but I 
live in fear of going out there now after what 
I've seen. My lawn can return to nature as far 
as I'm concerned," she said. 

She also believes not enough is being 
done to contain West Nile, saying the county 
sprayed the area after her lather's diagnosis - 
- tantamount to the "horse of out the barn" 

"They did a lot more spraying (for mos- 
quitoes) last year than they did this year," she 
said, not understanding the decisions of 
political leaders. 

She has also become much more aware 
that people need to take more precautions 
against West Nile. 

"They have to be more aggressive in 
terms of taking care of themselves in terms of 
spraying — and their children," she said. "I 
don't think people take it seriously. They 
don't realize how insidious this disease is," 
she said. 

Even her father didn't realize, 
Harmeyer admitted. 

"He said, 'They (mosquitoes) really 
don't like me. I've only got a couple bites.' It 
only takes one," Harmeyer said.

"You kind of have to take the good with

nology and users must have knowledge of the 
Internet. 

Vitz also noted the yin-and-yang of 
WebCT. 

"Since WebCT courses rely on technolo- 
gy functioning as it should, classes are dis- 
rupted when technology fails. There are some 
incompatibilities with WebCT's software and 
certain features of Web browsers and certain 
versions of them, which can cause minor 
problems occasionally," Vitz said. 



Bullion's advice for being successful in a 
WebCT class: "Make it a point of getting into 
the course WebCT ASAP and spend some 
time learning what is there and how to navi- 
gate among the different tools that are avail- 
able. And if in doubt, ask either the professor 
or the ITS staff." 

Miller - who is currently enrolled in a 
WebCT class ~ believes, "You must be must be 
disciplined to take a course this way." 

Vitz echoes the same sentiments.

'Miss IPFW' pageant to find talent 



By Kurtis Meyers 




thoul an audience. Each contestant 
jst also have a platform, an issue 



One year, a contestant stood on 
stage ana drew a picture of an Elvis 
song as it played in the background, 
proving you can turn anything you do 
well into your display of talent. 

Next comes the best and worst 
parts: evening wear and swimsuit, 
another 30% of the score. Once again, 
there's no need to worry, Bass and Parks 
say they're not looking for the beauty 
pageant stereotype. This part of the 
program is a chance for contestants to 
show their physical fitness and their 
personal style. 

After the scores are tallied, one love- 
ly lady is crowned the next Miss IPFW, 
but she's given much more than a title 
and crown. Miss IPFW is rewarded a 
scholarship, and automatically entered 
in the Miss Indiana pageant, which 
k'.uls directly to Miss America.

Theatre involvement not as 
inaccessible as one might think 



Members of the community 
that have always had an itch for 
the spotlight on center stage may 
not realize how easy it is to get 
there. Fort Wayne is a community 
of the Arts, and theatre shines 
brightly in our city. 

There's no need to have 
Bachelor's degrees in Theatre or 
even to have been involved in high 
school to be involved today. Any 
levels of experience are welcome in 
area theaters. Like any other cul- 
ture, the local Performing Arts 
community needs new people to 
survive and to grow. Most are 
excited, to have fresh faces and new 
enthusiasm. 

There's a common misconcep- 
tion that, in order to be involved, 
you have to have previous involve- 
ment and years of experience. 
Although helpful, it's not neces- 
sary, because no matter how you 
get involved, you'll gain experi- 
ence. Many of today's local theatri- 
cal stars started off working behind 
the scenes in a different role. 

The composition of a produc- 
tion is much like a puzzle. 



For the artists out there, pub- 
licity flyers, set design, and cos- 
tume creation all needs someone to 
nil ih.it role 

For those good with their 
hands, there is sewing, prop and 
set construction. 

If you enjoy crunching num- 
bers, budget work, ticket sales, and 
publicity are all math-heavy areas 
that fit the bill. 

Those of you that are more 
adept at computers and technolo- 
gies would be excellent working 
with all Ibe levers, knobs and dials 
of the sound and light boards 



I tht 






those seeking the spotlight C 
sing, or dance their way through 
the show. 

No matter where you want to 
get involved or how in-depth you 
want to be, there are many opiums 
available. 

Remember the next lime your leav- 
ing a show thinking to yourself. 
That looks like fun, I'd like to do 
that someday" you have no excuse 
as to why you can't be.

The majority of rapes are com

aren't aware of, Denhartog 
explained. 

Davis noted studies that show 
attacks by an acquaintance happi

slip "date rape" drugs into drinks

Davis makes a comparison.

- and linn he murders her, what

Students are taken through 
controlled "attack" situations dur- 
ing the course in an effort to 
expose some ideas for surviving

does give students &lt;m opportunity 
to think about what they could do

"It makes them feel like they'

WASHINGTON--(COLLEGIATE 
PRESSWIRE)-With student peer- 
to-peer (P2P) technology use on 
the rise, campus attitudes, if left 
unchecked, have the potential to 
open a floodgate for increased soft- 
ware piracy at U.S. colleges and 
universities, according to a survey 
released today by the Business 
Software Alliance (BSA). 

In an attempt to measure the 
digital piracy attitudes of students, 
faculty and administrators at U.S. 
colleges and universities nation- 
wide, an Ipsos survey commis- 
sioned by BSA found that a majori- 
ty of academics say downloading 
software is a real problem and 
nearly two-thirds of students say 
they would potentially download 
pirated software. 

Most students surveyed, how- 
ever, do not perceive that profes- 
sors discourage software theft. 
Only 28 percent were aware of 
their institution's software use 
policies. Of those, a slim majority 
say the policies are effective. 

"Students aren't being told. 
Downloading unlicensed or illegal 
files is a mistake,'" said Robert 
Holleyman, president and CEO of 
BSA.

He applauded schools that 
have recently taken steps to 
address Internet use and down- 
loading digital works in the wake 
of recent media attention around 
illegal music file-sharing activities 
on campus. 

"Institutions of higher educa- 
tion would benefit from a close 
working relationship with the BSA 
and the leaders of America's suc- 
cessful computer industry," said 
Sheldon Steinbach, vice president 
and general counsel, American 
Council on Education (ACE). 

"Universities and the informa- 
tion technology industries already 
collaborate on high-tech issues. We 
should work together on the devel- 
opment of educational resources. 
Faculty, students and the private 
sector will benefit," Steinbach com- 
mented. 

Despite the illegalities and 
unethical behavior, nobody is 
telling students its wrong, the sur- 
vey suggests. 

"What we're finding is that no 
more than a third of the students 
say that professors actively dis- 
courage ihem from swapping soft- 
ware or installing software on mul- 
tiple machines," Holleyman said. 

Other survey highlights 

- A strong majority of educators 
support enforcement of campus 
policies designed to prevent unli- 
censed software use on campus. 

- When it comes to university 
action against software piracy 
among students, however, only 

one-in-six faculty 
and administra- 
tors would 



BSA initiati 
study attitudes 
toward download- 
ing, file-sharing 
and copyright law 

and college stu- 
dents, faculty and 
administrators. 

According to the survey, more 
than three-quarters of faculty and 
administrators say it is absolutely 
"not okay" to download or swap 
files, yet less than one-quarter of 
students says it is wrong. 

Additional findings include: 

- 23 percent of college and univer- 
sity students have downloaded 
software with only 32 percent pay- 
ing for it all or most of the time. 

- 69 percent have downloaded 
' music, with only 8 percent of them 

paying for it all or even most of the 

- 26 percent have downloaded 
movies, with only 4 percent paying 
for it all or most of the time. 

- More than 40 percent of educators 
say it's "okay" to share or swap 
software to cut costs. 

- Despite their behavior, 93 percent 
of students endorse the intellectual 
property values of rewarding soft- 
ware developers and protecting 
intellectual property rights in order 
to encourage research and devel- 
opment. 



"Schools need to edu- 
cate students about 
the consequences of

piracy. If they don't, 
many of these stu- 
dents are likely to

'One toke over the line' in 
the tropical South Pacific 



So you see, I was trending water 
in the middle of a swimming pool 
at a fairly upscale resort in the city 
of Cebu, in the Philippines. 

My mother, my aunt Peggy, 
and my then two-year-old sister 
Molly were all with me. It had been 
a long day. Molly, you must under- 
stand, was adopted from the 
Philippines. 

She originally came to our 
family classified ,is &lt;i "medical mis- 

In other words, my parents 
acted as foster parents so she could 
come to the United States to have 
some medical work done, work 
that would not be possible to get in

for that matter.

adopting them, if they are able. 

These kids spend months, or 
even years, with the family, so 
imagine how hard it would be to 
have to send them back. So of 
course my parents wanted to adopt 
Molly. In order to do this, accord- 
ing to Filippino law, one of the par- 
ents must present his/herself the 
Filippino Office of Adoptions in 

I, fresh out of high school, 
wanted to join my mother. I have a 
couple of other Filippino-adopted 
sisters, and I've been there before, 
four years earlier. 

My mother's sister, Peggy, 
came with us Eight months before 
the planes crashed into the World 
Trade Center, we went well before 
the terrorists in southern 
Philippines started to kidnap 
Americans, so we didn't feel we 
were in any danger. 

It was right after President 
Marcos was ousted from office, and 
a bit before the reactionary riots 



we encountered no 
danger from that, 
either.

part. The rea- 

was the fact that we made a mini- 
vacation out of the whole ordeal. 

One of the orphanages we've 
been to before was run by some 
nuns whom we've become friends 
with, and we wanted to visit them, 
in Cebu City. 

So that's the reason we were 
at a resort in Cebu. We've had a 
long, hot day pf waiting for planes 
and taxis; so we Wanted to relax in' 
the pool. 

I was feeling a little over- 
whelmed by being in this rather 
foreign place, having just eaten at 
the hotel's restaurant, and finding 
fish-heads, yes, fish-heads at the 
buffet, 

I passed that by, needless to 
say. While swimming around the 
pool, cooling off, there was a smell 
that wafted through the air, sort of 
a cross between burning leaves and 
tobacco. 

My mother and Peggy 
exchanged looks. I, being the shel- 



tered young man I was, and to 
some extent, still am, had no idea 
what this scent might be. 

Suddenly, two rather scruffy 
workers sauntered out onto the far 
lawn from behind a shed with 
smoke rising up from the back, 
laughing and speaking lagalng (a 
Filippino dialect) very quickly. 

It wasn't until after we had 
toweled off and went back to our 
room, that Mom told me that one 
of the plants still growing in the 
wilderness of the Philippines is the 
marijuana plant. 

These workers were probably 
on break of off-duty and ran across 
a patch, and decided to have a very 
special, ver\ potent bonfire. 

All in all, I had a very educa- 
tional, interesting experience. 

Nowadays, of course, with the 
kidnappings and the bombings 
and other terrorist acts in many 
third-world countries, including 
the Philippines, I don't think that 
I'd like to visit the South Pacific, 
unless I had no less than three 
armed bodyguards and a bullet- 
proof limo.

Blood Drive is set 
for Sept. 30 at IPFW 



Every two seconds in America a 
person requires blood. 

Unfortunately, not all of us can 
become donors and most people 
who can usually don't. Virtually all 
of us will need blood at one point 
in our lives. Donating blood on a 
regular basis will ensure that we 
receive our own blood back. 

On Tuesday, Sept. 30 from 10 
a.m. to 3 p.m., IPFW will "be host- 
ing a blood drive sponsored by the 
American Red Cross. 

The check-in will be held in 
the student commons in the 
Science Building. All are wel- 
comed, appoinlments can be made 
and walk-ins are accepted. 

Anyone interested in sched- 
uling an appointment can contact 
Penny Leverman at 481-6284. 

After filling out the paper- 
work, the Blood Mobile will be 
ready out in front of the Science 
Building for all who are interested. 

On Sept. 30, All donors will 
receive a free T-shirt courtesy of the 
American Red Cross. 

Donors are asked to provide 
valid identification, and are 
advised to do the following. 

Eat iron rich food such as 
red meat, fish, poultry, broccoli, 
beans, prunes and raisins, a few 



days before the donation. 

You should avoid alcoholic 
and caffeinated beverages for 
about 48 hours. And avoid fatty 
foods such as hamburgers, french 
fries, and ice cream. 

The 'Save a Life Tour' is hop- 
ing to collect a total of 3 million 
units of blood nationally. The 
regional goal is to collect 55,000 
units of blood, and the campus 
goal is 50 units, according to offi- 
cials. ' 

Blood can be donated every 
eight weeks after the age of 17. 
Donor weight should be 110 
pounds or more and in good gen- 
eral health. 

Here are a few facts about 
blood donating that should be 
known according to the American 
Red Cross. 

Over 95 percent ot eligible 
donors don't donate. The most 
blood type is O+ and the 
tmon type is AB-. 

In Northeast Indiana alone, 
the Red Cross has to collect about 
450 units of blood a day. Up to 12 
tests are conducted on donating 
blood including tests for HIV, 
Hepatitis B and C, as well as blood 
type. And people 65 years of age 
and older compose 13 percent of 
the population, but they use 25 
percent of all blood units trans-

Commentary 

Breaking the tradition: Get a clue Irish 



By Justin Kenny 

The Communicator 

Heading into this season, I 
expected a lot from my Notre 
Dame Fighting Irish. 

Most of the players from a 
defense ranked in the top ten in the 
country returned this season, and I 
thought that the offense couldn't 
play much worse than it did dur- 
ing last year's 10-3 campaign. 

Boy, was I wrong. 

After last weekend's 22-16 
loss to Michigan State the Irish are 
1-2 and look more like the 
Cathedral High School Fighting 
Irish than one of the top teams in 
the land. In the first three games 
quarterback Carlyle Holiday has 
gone from respected option quar- 
terback turned pocket passer to 
walking around with a bulls-eye 
attached to his chest so folks can 
throw their barbs at him. Now I, 
am going to join the bandwagon. 

No matter what coach Ty 






Willingham says at his weekly 
press conference, it appears that 
Holiday is getting worse each 
week, nut better. He mis&gt;ed at least 
a half dozen wide open i 
last Saturday, several n 
threw bounced three yards 
of the receiver. He is afraid to 
throw downfield due to lack of 
confidence. All an opponent has to 
do is shut down the running game 
and Notre Dame is left crippled. 
Notre Dame's wide receivers may 
as well just do cartwheels down the 
field during a play considering 
they never see the ball come to 

So, in comes true freshman 
Brady Quinn late in the game 
Saturday and, what do you know? 



u, lid.. 






pocket passer and seems to have a 
lot more confidence than Holiday 
and a lot better skills. But 
UiUiii-li.un is hesitant to name 
him the starting quarterback for 



this week's game at Purdue Maybe 
he is waiting for Holiday to just 
begin handing over the ball to the 
defense right when he gets the ball 
instead of wasting time by throw- 
ing it to them downfield. 

Irish fans are arrogant, if we 
don't win a national champi- 
onship, it's the coaches fault. 

People are already calling for 
Willingham's head and wanting 
Tampa Bay coach Jon Gruden in 
the hizzouse. Yeah, he just won a 
Super Bowl, why would he want to 
coach a team that after every loss 
the fans treat it as if the U.S, was 
just hit with another terrorist 
attack? 

With all the problems for the 
Irish, this week's game holds spe- 
cial meaning for me. Namely. I hate 
Purdue's guts. 

It has been quite amusing 
over the years to watch "Purdont" 
snatch defeat from the jaws of vic- 
tory nearly every time they play 



Freshman Ritchey breaks 
school cross country mark 



By IPFW News Services 

Freshman Ashley Ritchey 
broke an 18-year IPFW Cross 
Country record at the Bowling 
Green State University's Mel Brodt 
Invitational on September 13. 

The Leo High product tra- 
versed the 5K course in a time of 
18:53:00. That was seven seconds 
better than the IPFW Ail-Time 5K 
record of Krystal Walker. Walker's 
time of 19:00:00 was set back in 



1985. 

"She's set the bar prett\ high 
for herself now," said IPFW Cross 
Country Coach Mike Fruchey. "The 
sky is the limit because she really 
believes she's fast and it is coming 
out in her races, " he added. 

Ritchey has been the top IPFW 
finisher in both meets that IPFW 
has run this fall. She finished 12th 
at the Valparaiso Invitational, and 
her IPFW record was good for 16th 
in a loaded Bowling Green field. 



"Once again, this perf&lt; 
sets a high standard for all the girls. 
It raises all of their performances 
because there is no pressure for 
them to be up front because she is 
up front," Fruchey said. 

"It also sends a message to all 
the local kids that we've got a great 
thing going here. We've got a good 
program, we're deep in talent, and 
if they come here they're going to 
develop into a pretty good runner," 
he added. 



the Irish. No matter what kind of 
lead Purdue has, they always find a 
way to blow it. And that, is quite 
amusing. While 1 respect Purdue 
fans, I still don't get how you can 
like a team that's initials are, "P.U." 
Doesn't that say it all? 

And hopefully, the Purdue 
implosion will occur with Quinn 
behind center for the Irish instead 
of Holiday. Holiday has had his 
chances and his nine lives should 
be up by now. Quinn has proven 
himself to be a stable presence in 
the backfield for the Irish. 

Who cares if the guy is a fresh- 
man? At least he can hit receivers 
in the numbers instead of on the 
shoelaces. 

So coach Willingham, take off 
the sunglasses, see the light, and 
make some changes so we can at 
least beat Purdont. 

That's all I ask, until next

Prediction: Pittsburgh. 

Indiana at Michigan: I'd 
hate to be the Hoosiers for a couple

Because the IPFW dub is 
in its embryonic stages, there 
is only a board of officers. 
Once student participation 
increases, members will be 
able to vote on issues such as

and times. 

Initial dubmevtings will 
be posted around campus via fliers and the library's 
electronic message board. 

"Once we have a lot more members, what we 
can do is limited by the creativity of the members. 
We can go to different drop zones, jump from differ-
