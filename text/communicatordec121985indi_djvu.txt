Indiana University-Purdue University at Fort Wayne 



Tluirsday. December 12. 19ti.'i 



Kostoff replaces Miller 



!)&gt; EARl.SiMllEI 
Chief Reporter 

Senalc Presiilenl Pro Tern Gina 
Koslon Will become Sludenl Body Vice- 
Presidenl Jan. 8, replacing Brad Miller 
who IS spending Spring semester al 
Erasmus University in Rollerdam. 
Nelhcrlands. 

Kostoff said she was "scared, sur- 
prised, and excited" about her 
elevation to student body vice- 
president. She said she hasn't had loo 
much time to think about goals during 
her term of office. 

Kostoff IS a Fort Wayne native who 
graduated from Bishop Dwenger High 
School m 1982 She is an Indiana 
University senior with a double 
major— political science and history. 
Her first experience with student 
government was last semester, 

Kostoff wants to see the role of 
sludenl senator expanded to become 
more involved in campus ad- 
ministration and activities. She also 
wants (o see more student involvement 
in Students Government. "I want to he 
open and receptive lo sludenl con- 
cerns," shesaid. 

Kostoff pledged lo be available for 



studenis to come to the office and talk 
aboul anything Student Goverrunent 
has or has not done. "I would rather 
they come in and talk than write a letter 
to the editor lof The Communicator)." 
shesaid. 

Dean of Sludenis John Ulmer was 
also surprised by the Miller 
resignation "(I's unforlunate in terms 
of the Senate leadership because it will 
break continuity. It is a feather in bur 
hal, loo. because not all who apply do 
this program! gel lo go," he said. 

Ulmer is oplimisiic. "Gina will be 
([uite good She is well regarded and 
knowledgeable," he said. 



Miller expects to continue his in- 
volvement in student government when 
he returns. He is leaving his post with 
many concerns, 

"Students Government doesn't have 
a grasp on its own activities— we don'l 
really control ourselves," Miller said. 
He altribuled part of this problem lo 
lack of student support of Studenis 
Government. "Without sludenl sup- 
port, we don'l pack any authority with 
Ihe administration or the community al 
large," Miller said. To gel support. 
Students Government has lo otter 
services the student body wants and 
needs, said Miller

Hartman takes a shot at Hoosier Hysteria 



Bj CAUOLKOE.MO 
Staff Writer 

An IPFW student with a passion for 
basketball got what he calls a once in a 
lifetime chance to lake part in the 
filming of a movie about Indiana's 
basketball spirit. 

Craig Hartman, a freshman at IPFW, 
went lo Indianapolis this month to play 
the part of a high school basketball 
player in the film "Hoosiers," starring 
Gene Hackman, thai wilt finish filming 
in Indiana this week. 

The film is based on the 1954 
basketball learn of tiny Milan high 
school, a school of 150 students, Hart- 
man knew Ihe slory. "It's pretty well 
known among people who follow high 
school basketball, " he said. Only seven 
or eight people went oul for the Milan 
team, but, they got a team logelher and 
went through the season and on lo the 
slate championships. There, in the final 
seconds of the game, they beat 
powerhouse Muncie Central by a score 
of 32-30, 

Hartman. who has been shooting 
baskets ever since he could hold onto a 
basketball, says he is a real basketball 
freak "I love basketball, especially 
Indiana high school and college 
basketball. It has been a part of my life 
for a long time," he said. 

When the word got out the film 
makers would be casting roles for 
"Hoosiers" in Indiana, some of Hart- 
man's friends called him, knowing how 
much he loved basketball, and 
suggested he go down and try out. "i 
Ihoughi I might as well take a shot al 
It," he said So, in August he went to 
Indianapolis lo try out along with 700 
other hopeful young men. 

'Everybody looked the same," 
Hartman said. "Everybody was 5'n", 
had their hair combed to the side, and 
just looked like a Hoosier. I Ihoughi I'd 
never getapart," 

Hartman survived several casting 



cuts and was among the final IH people 
lo be considered tor a part. At the 
Iryouls he had lo play basketball and 
read scripts bul in the end he did not get 
one of Ihe parts being cast. 

Then last month Ihe movie people 
called andsaidlheyhada pari for him, 

Hartman plays a member of an op- 
posing team Ihe fictional Hickory High 
Huskers play early in their cham- 
pionship season, 

"It wasn't what I expecled," said 
Hartman, about the filming. "It was so 
technical, everything had to be perfect 
In fact they even told me how' lo wear 
my socks," he said, A scene which 
might be two minutes long in the 
finished film took four hours to shoot 
the day Hartman was there. 

Tlicy filmed for 15 hours that day. 
"There was a lot of waiting and just 
doing il over and over again," he said. 

In order lo make Ihe players look like 
they were really playing ball instead of 
standing around, the movie crew called 
for "sprints and spritz". "They would 
shoul Ihal oul and we'd start running 
sprints:" said Hartman. "As soon as 
you slarl breathing heavy they grease 
you up with this sluff thai makes you 
glow and then they would sprilz water 
all over lo make you look sweaty. Then 
after shooting a tew shots if we'd gel 
dried off they would yell sprints and 
sprilzagain, ' 

Harlman got to meet a lot of Ihe key 
people making the film like screen- 
writer Angelo Pizzo, director David 
Anspaugh, and aclor Gene Hackman. 
"He (Hackman) was really nice, intact 
he came up and started talking lo me," 
said Harlman, 

Hartman enjoyed watching a 
professional like Hackman, who plays 
the Hickory coach, at work, "He was 
really good. One minute he was talking 
to me about Ihe Chicago Bears only 
being a four point favorite in the Miami 
game and then the next minute he 




Craig Harlman. 
basketball playei 

turned around and was acting like he 
was gelling in an argument with the 
referee and was totally into his 
character. "said Harlman. 

Hartman, a sports management 
major, has no future acting plans 



Right now he is placing an emphasis on 
his education. But given the chance 
would lie do il again" "Oh yeah. ' he 
said 'Tl was a neat experience I had a 

blasl."

By EARl. SMITH 
Chief Reporter 

The presentation and discussion of a proposal by Legal Services of Maumee 
Valley, Inc (ISMV) look most of iheStudent Senate's time last week. 

Robert 'Zatu-I, program administrator, and Gregg Haifley, executive director of 
LSMV, proposed to establish an outreach office at IPFW during the Spring. 1930,

because of student need, " Zahrl said, 

' This year sludenl services and student government have received Iwo calls per 
month inquiring aboul the legal-aid program," said John Ulmer. dean of sludenis. 
There was an active program eight to ten years ago, said Ulmer. but it gradually 
fell apart. The program has been non-existanl during tJie last two or three years, 

ISMV would provide complete represenlaiion in ten areas of civil law except for 
court costs, for those who fell within their income guidelines, said Zahrl . 
"Our concern would be this program is excluding some of our studenis because 



Ihey don't qualify." said Joe Motherwell, student body president. Gina KosiofI 
agreed. She fell the Student Senalc should work on a program all studenis could 
use 

Student Senate voted it to one to approve Ihe proposal on a trial basis 

Student Senate also approved selling Dine-a-Mate coupon books. After debating 
Ihe merits of selling the coupon book as a service project ( selling ihem at cost i or a 
fund raising project. Student Senate voted ten to two in favor of selling them as a 
fundraising project 

Student Senate was informed Brad Miller, student body vice-president and Sheri 
Kallenmark, Student Senate clerk, were resigning lo study in Ihe Netherlands 
during spring semester. 

Inother action. 

Sludenl Senate decided lo have an information lableal regislralion;

Don't go through the holi-daze 



Wilh Ihe holiday season now upon us. 
The Communicator would like to stress 
safely when celebrating. 

Drunk driving is Ihe leading cause of 
accidental deaths, especially during the 
holidays. When at a parly, limit ihe 
number of drinks you consume. Take 
time lo enjoy Ihe celebration wilhoui Ihe 
fuzzy haze of alcohol. 

If you do consume loo much alcohol. 
call a cab. or gel a ride with a friend who 
is sober. Is having those extra drinks 
really worth enough \,o risk your life and 
Ihe lives of innocent people? 

Alcohol slows Ihe body's processes, 
both thinking and responding. When 
under Ihe influence, the body cannot 
respond as quickly as it should when Ihe 
mind commands. And the command is 
slowed by an intoxicated mind. Think of 
alcohol as an obslruclion, a blockade. It 
affects coordinalion, responsiveness, 
Ihoughl-processing. rationalization, and 
simple body functions. 

New Year's Eve is an especially bad 
lime for drunk driving. If you're hosting 



a party, keep an eye on the number of 
drinks your guests consume. In Indiana, 
Ihe host of the parly is responsible for 
any activity caused by a drunken guest 
This means if your good ol' buddy has 
one too many and insists on driving, stop 
him, If he causes or is involved in an 
accident, the blame will rest with you. 
Nol necessarily jusl him. This goes for 
bartenders and liquor and parly store 
clerks, too. 

Indiana State Police and Fort Wayne 
City Police double their efforts this lime 
of year. Crack downs on drunk driving 
are enforced by departments and the 
police will not hesitate lo charge over- 
zealous partiers with DWI's. 

Bagged, blollo, buzzed, canned, 
bombed, boozed, intoxicated, inebriated, 
fried, cockeyed, juiced, loaded, lit up, 
lushed, oiled, pickled, polluted, 
plastered, shot, smashed, potted, stiff, 
stewed, stoned, tanked, tight, wel or 
zonked, it's all the same. Do yourself a 
favor and make sure none of these words 
applies loyou this holiday season. Drive 
to stay alive. 



True meaning often lost amid 
commercialism of the season 



The Christmas season has descended 
upon us and the streets are lit — not with 
ordinary street lamps — but with 
holiday" glow. Tinsel and bright lights 
sparkle along Ihe downtown streets and 
in people's yards. Sanla Claus and his 
: reindeer sail across the sky on a 
downtown bank building. 

What does Christmas mean? Ask a 
child and he will say it is all about lots of 
toys, presents and Santa. Hopefully, the 
child will also remember lo add that 
Christmas is a time to share love and 
happiness with friends and families. 

But of course, few children will say 
that. That is not the major theme we 
instill concerning the holiday season. 
From October on. children are 
bombarded with the idea Ihal all there is 



lo Christmas is Santa Claus, toys, a 
handsomely dressed dinner table, and a 
Christmas tree decorated wilh 
ornaments and toys. But it doesn't have 
to be thai way. 

This holiday season, we should try to 
change this attitude. 

This year, try to concentrate on other 
aspects of Christmas. Enjoy the limes 
you spend with your family. Above all — 
lorget that the gifts you received were 
not exactly what you wanted, II may be a 
Irile phrase, but it still rings true ,.. il is 
the thought that really counts the most in 
gift giving. 

Above all, have a safe and happy 
holiday season. 

Merry Christmas from The

upsel or amused. However.

No censorship 

To the Editor: 

t musi vehemently protest 
your recen! editorial con- 
cerning allegedly por- 
nographic materials in the 
bookstore. I have always 
found It ludicrous Jhat 
journalists should support 
anything that even remotely 
smacks of censorship and lo 
suggest il in an academic 
setting is especially 
adhorrent lo me. 

Furthermore, there 
remains ihe problem ot who 
js to decide whal is or is not 
pornographic. I am afraid 
thai I know very few people 
who consider Playboy to be 
pornography. The bookstore 
has sold works by authors 
such as Allen Ginsberg and 
James Joyce that have been 
acclaimed as obscene. Is

Sexist course 

To the Editor 

This letter concerns the 
overt sexism which has been 
pervasive throughoui Ihe 
entire semester in Dr. txiuis 
Cantor's history course, 
'"The Protest Movement of 
IhcSixlies." 

This is lo advi.se him that if 
he chooses to continue to 
profess to be a profound 
expert on the period of the 
l9GU's then why did he fail to 
incorporate in his list of 
potenlial term paper topics 
famous female leaders of 
[hal same period? Rather he 
chose the sexist alternative 
of placing them into the 
generic category of ' 'Women 
Leaders lone^ or many)." 
while at the' same time 
listing numerous male 
leaders of Ihe '6(is in- 
dividually by name. It ap- 
pears thai il Dr. Cantor is 
lacking in the knowledge of 
female leaders, then I have 
taken il upon myself to give 
him a partial list which may 
be ot help to him in Ihe 
future. 

This list includes such 
prominani figures as Angela 



Davis. Joan B.ic?, Glonn 
Stcinem, Betty Friedan, 
Delia Absuz, Germaine 
Greer. Kate Millel. Buffy 
Sainte-Marie. Twiggy, 
Jacqueline Kcnnedy- 
Onassis, Susan Sonlag. Jane 
Fonda, Jams Joplin. Coretta 
Scoll King, ahd so on. 

It is this precise sexism on 
the pari of this particular 
professor which accounts for 
the current reduction of 
history majors on this 
campus today. If he fails lo 
change his sexist ideology 
towards women then 
perhaps he should change 



the course narni? from "The 
ProlesI Movement of Ihe 
Sixties" lo "Male Protest 
Movement of the Sixties." 

Lastly, as a liberal arts 
major. I am repulsed by Ihis 
stifling view of women when 
courses of this nature are to 
supposedly allow thcsludcnl 
lo think freely and openly 
without injection of a per- 
sonal sexist bias I cannot 
believe Ihat ihis type of 
sexism still prevails on this 
campus in the 'BOs. ' - 

Linda Banks Williams and 

olhor concerned students 

and professors

If you've been (o the maul — er. mall, and failed to find 
thai unique gift, take a trip downtown. The whole area is 
virtually deserted while everyone else in Alien County 
migrates loGlenbrook or Sou thtown. 

Three good places to go are the Third World Shop, the 
Museum of Art and the Historical Museum, They're brim- 
ming with handmade, unique gifts — you have my per- 
mission to buy a little something for yourself, loo. 

The Third World Shop. 611 W, Wayne St.. is virtually 
stuffed with handloomed clothing from around the world. 
From brightly colored lote bags to gently floating caftans to 
intricately carved animals, the Third World Shop has 
something for ail ages. 

Next lime you visit the Museum of Art, 311 W, Main St.. 
slop into the gift shoppe. where original art lakes many 
forms. Ceramics, paper, 1-lK gold and other mediums are 
fashioned into an eccleetic assortment of potential gifts. You 
can choose your gifts, the wrapping paper and cards all m 
one place — nowallyouneedis tlie tape! 

One block away stands (he Historical Museum al 302 E, 
Berry St. The gift shoppe here will be of special interest if it's 
an Old Fashioned Christmas you have in mind, A myriad of 
toys, dolls and games, all handmade or antique reproduc- 
e (here for your remmiscing pie; 

Also, ail are non-profit organizations, as opposed to the 
storesatGlenbrook. 

So avoid the crowds and get some fresh air by taking a 
short trip, .downtown, where you can forget all your troubles

Tommy Dorsey concert: a good time had by all 




llK'TommyDorsey concert. (Pholobv L^^iiit' Fredrick).

Gil EVEN 

Features Editor 

The cavernous convenlion 
hull of the Grand Wayne 
Center was iranstormed into 
.1 romantic oasis where 
approximately BOO people 
lllcrally danced the night 



away to the big band sound 
of the Tommy Doreey 
Orchestra Friday night. 

In the gentle glow of 
candlelight, many revelers 
reminisced about the last 
time they had danced to this 

■New Year's Eve, 19- 
maybe-S5." tnused one 



gentleman. "I didn't think 
any of them (band mem- 
bersi were still alive!" 

"Oh, please come back 
later. Dear! This is our 
song," crooned one woman 
as she and her partner made 
their way to the crowded 
dance floor. 

'"My husband proposed to 



me the last (in 
band," smiled a woman as 
she extricated herself from 
the dance floor. Her husband 
was about to reveal the year 
when she playfully poked 
him in the ribs. "The young 
lady's with a newspaper, 
Darling," she hissed. 

I was called young lady a 
lot. When the bulk of the 
patrons IS 60 years old, 30 
must seem quite young, at 
Ihal, Tables of couples my 
age dolled the floor, and 
their comments were also 
quite positive. 

One of these young ladies. 
Teresa Macy, a 29-year-old 
office manager, volunteered 
she hadn't seen so many 
people doing the fox-trot 
since she'd first encountered 
it a year ago at Arthur 
Murray da nee school. 

"II brought back such 
memories of my parents 
talking about the big band 
music." said Tom Robbins. a 
31-year-old Fine Arts 
Foundation employee. 

John Walls, the 26-year-old 
operations manager and co- 
owner of a video production 
company was "sorry to see 
so few people my age here. 
I'm sure they would tike this 
music if they gave it a 
chance His dale. Erika 



Hoham. an IPFW senior, 
agreed and added she's 
■glad that SUBOG spon- 
sored something so classy." 

The orchestra's sound was 
strong and bold, daring 
anyone within hearing range 
not to be swept away by its 
special magic. The dance 
floor was a sea of luxedos. 
glittery dresses and smiling 
faces as the band played on. 

Responsible for those 
smiling faces are the people 
who worked so hard behind 
the scenes since last August. 
One of those many people is 
Mary Brant, director of 
student activities She's 
devoted the majority of her 
lime over four months to 
help members of SUBOG 
coordinate this event, with 
assistance of the staff. 

Brant was "manmng" the 
reception table in the lobby 
of the Grand Wayne during 
most of the dance She made 
sure people found their 
tables if an usher eouldn'l 
immediately be located, 
directed others to the cloak 
room or water fountain and 
made sure the ticket booth 
was staffed. Apparently, 
some last minute re- 
arranging o( tables had to be 
done to enlarge the dance 
area and some tables had 



been moved. BranI per- 
sonally escorted '.heso 
displaced persons to their 
new tables, smiling 
cheerfully through it all. 

■'I leel this very successful 
event brought the University 
and the community together. 
Many people commented 
they were glad the 
University sponsored it," 
Brant said. 

The concert chairperson 
with SUBOG was Lisa 
Buckles. 

Lisa Sewell. SUBOG 
chairperson, said she 
'■enjoyed working on this 
project. I'd like lo see more 
interaction belween IPFW 
and the community, it has 
been a learning experience 
for us all." 

Sewoll's fiance, Dan 
Bradley, an IPFW music 
student, was "excited losee 
the orchestra. 1 don't get the 
chance lo see live music like 
this in Fort Wayne. I hope we 
can do this again!' 

As the midnight hour 
approached, the band bid 
lareWell to its very en- 
thusiastic audience and 
groups of people began lo 
drifl out of the hall I'm sure 
1 overheard one couple 
harmonizing lo '"I Could 
Have Danced All Nigh! "

Calahan meets challenge of basketball 



H&gt; JK.WVBLAKLEV 
Sports ICdilor 

A new job always brings a 
challungc. but Julie Calahan 
has met the challenge. 
Calahan is in her first year 
as Ihe IPFW women's 
baskeiball coach, •'['ve had 
really good reception (from 
Ihc people here)," Calahan 
says "The people make (he 



. Ifthepcoplemakeyou 
reel you're a part o( 
isomelhingJ, that's what it's 
all about," 

Calahan, previous to her 
position at IPFW. was an 
assistant coach at Montana 
State One positive aspect of 
Iwing (he Mastodon's head 
i:oach is the duly. "(When at 
Montana Slalei. my ideas 




didn't get implemented." 
Calahan says^ "I was ready 
(or a head coaching job. I 
wanted the challenge and 
responsibility Now I have 
more o( a say in the 
program," 

Overall, Calahan has 
encountered Tew difdculUes 
in her work. "There are a 
(ew minor frustrations. But 
they are m every job and 
situation," Calahan says, 
"I'm still learning, and 
making mistakes, but it's 
good that I'm making them 
early. Things are going 
fairly well, though," 

The transition from 
Montana lo Indiana has 
brought its challenges, as 
well as rewards, according 



Calahan. "Indiana is 
strong ba.skeiball stale. 
(People areJ very interested 
in basketball," Calahan 
comments 'IPFW also has 
its own set of problems, 
though, it (IPFW) is a 
commuter campus, and it's 
harder to reach the more 
mobile population of 
students." 

[PFW has an upstart 
athletic program. According 
lo Calahan, various dif- 
ficulties arc found in 
building on the program, 
because of its relatively 
recent birth. Calahan was 
very willing to meet this, the 
seemingly largest possible 
impediment. "(The 
program) is young.

progressive and gn 
Calahan says. "Wi 
more fan and 
support as well as more 
scholarships for all sports. It 
takes a while to build 
tradition, it's a slow and 
growing process, but you 
have lo be patient. It's 
getting better." 

The process can be a 
difficult one, however. 
Calahan explains. 

"We need more fans 
at the games (for success), 
but lo get more fans, we 
must have a good team llo 
start withl. It's a cycle that's 
viciousat times. ' 

Calahan is involved in 
other activilies aside from 
coaching. "I taught part of a 
wellness and stress 
management class, and a 
nursing class," Calahan 
says She adds she Is also 



assisting with various fit- 
ncss-wellness programs in 
the area fitness centers. 

These non-baskelball 
related activities help to 
keep Calahan from being loo 
"all -consumed" in the sport. 
"You can get burned oul on 
basketball. Coaching is 
emotionally draining at 
times," Calahan remarks. 
"So much goes into practice

the travel, and so on. U can
