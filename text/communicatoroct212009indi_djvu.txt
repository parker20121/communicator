Mike Birbiglia plays at 
Rhinehart Music Center 



By Craig Lloyd 

MhhfrttoontMfntiil low 



Rhinehan Music Center 
on the IPFW campus is 
mottly used for our fellow 
students and faculty to 
Icam. play and leach musn. 
day in and day out. tor 
ilic first time ever, Auer 
Performance Mall inside 
Khi unhurt was turned into a 
comedy club for one night 
us famous comedian Mike 
Hirbiglia stepped onio the 
stage lo deliver his stand up 
comedy .cl. 

Ilirhiglia has had two 
Comedy Central specials as 
well as multiple appearances 
on laic night talk shows and 
radio shows like Hoh &amp; 
Tom. He also has several 
DVDs and albums out as 
well. Although he has 
been around since 2002 
and has been blagging his 
"Secret Public Journal" 
long before blogging was 
ever popular, Birbiglia is 
not as famous as bigger 
names like Jeff Dunham and 
Dane Cook, but still delivers 
ii memorable comedie 
performance. 

Mike Birbiglia's act 
was very original and 
incomparable to any other 
comedian. He is very laid 
hack and almost sounds 
like he is about to pass out 
when he performs due lo his 
mildly slurred speech. Many 




would probably mistake this 
and say he is in a drunken 
state, but he ussured the 
crowd that he was not. 

Burbiglia is an incredible 
storyteller and turns all of 
his negative memories of 
his youth into hilarious 

jokes, like having u tumor in 

his bladder, prostate exams, 
being bullied at Catholic 
school and throwing up on 
carnival rides. He ended his 
storytelling streak by talking 
about his sleepwalking 
problem. 

"To prevent me from 
sleepwalking I wear a 



Photo courtesy of KVHT.com 
sleeping bag zipped up 
to my neck and I wear n 
mittens, that way I cannot 
gel out," said Birbiglia. 

At the end of the 
performance, Birbiglia 

wrapped up by playing 
a couple of tunes on the 
guitar and performed 

several humorous variations 
of rock music from 
different religions and 
also did a classy cover of 
John Denver's "Take Me 
Home. Country Roads" to 
incorporate each city that he 
visited or will visit on the 
tour. 



Kids Against Hunger 



By Louisa Danielson 

danlUOl eitud enli Ipfw k)u 



Sunday, October 25 - 
A German dinner will be 
held to raise money for 
the Kids Against Hun- 
ger international orga- 
nization. Items on the 
menu will include brat- 
wurst, sauerkraut. Ger- 
man potato salad and 
npfelkuchen. The dinner 
will be held in die Nerger 
Room at St. Paul's Evan- 
gelical Lutheran Church 
II 126 S. BarrSt), follow- 
ing their Reformation 
Vespers Service at 3:30 
pin. 

This dinner is 
the grand final to the cel- 
ebration held at St. Paul's 
Evangelical Lutheran 
Church to mark the 492 
anniversary of the Prot- 
estant Reformation. 
Other activities for the 
day will include a ves- 
pers service featuring the 



combined adult choirs of 
three area churches, two 
children's choirs, and 
special organ and string 
music. 

Funds from the Ger- 
man dinner will go to 
the Kids Against Hunger 
organization, which is 
dedicated to the eradi- 
cation of hunger among 
children both here in 
the United States and 
in countries around the 
world. According to their 
website (ivww.fccdingchil- 
dren.org) the organization 
has already distributed 
meals for 100 million 
children and their fami- 
lies. 

Kids Against Hun- 
ger is a volunteer-based 
program, which strives 
to provide pre-packaged 
rice and soybean casse- 
roles to starving families 
around the world. Using 
a recipe created by a joint 
effort of the Pillsbury. 
General Mills, Cargill 
and Archer Daniels Mid- 



land companies, volun- 
teers mix rice, soybeans, 
a vegetable extract and 
chicken broth powder to 
create a highly nutritious 
casserole that reverses 
the devestation of star- 
vation in children. Each 
package of casserole 
contains six servings, at 
twenty-three cents per 
serving. 

The organization has 
eighteen volunteer bases 
in the United States and 
one center in Canada, 
where stockpiled ingre- 
dients are mixed and 
packaged. Over 200,000 
people have assisted 
with the organization's 
culinary efforts, so far.

efit dinner at St. Pauls

Anthropology Department approaches with New Chair 



Dr. Richard Sutler, a profes- 
sor ai Indiana- Purdue Univer- 
sity sits calmly describing his 
ultimate experience as an an- 
thropologist. He points to pho- 
tographs of ancient "Moche" 
artifacts and skeletal remains 
that are placed neatly across 
his quaint culturally divided 
office. 

Suiter goes on to explain 
that his passions arc now 
achievements. He describes 
himself as a perfectionist, and 
that willingness to broaden the 
views on campus, and educate 
students through Anthropol- 
ogy. "Much of my current re- 
search ultimately touches on 
the process of group social 
identity formation or ethnoge- 
nlsis (Chaplin 20091." 

With most of his achieve- 
ments and travel experiences. 
Sutter developed a respectable 
background through his de- 
termination and hard dedica- 
tion. He goes on with a smile. 
although being the new Chair 
of the Anthropology Depart- 
ment and Fulltime professor 
at IPFW. he keeps his involve- 
ment through active clubs and 
presentations located on the 
campus. 

An addition to his already 
tentative schedule. Suiter al- 
ludes to his relationship with 
the Anthropology club. The 



Club stands as the oldest ac- 
tive club on campus, holding 
a reputable standing in which 
Sutter has a high interest in 
getting the students involved 
to give them a clear outlook on 
how anthropology affects us In 
today's society. 

Since Alan R. Sandstrom's 
retirement at age 62. also 
known for his publications in 
cultural anthropology. Dr. Sut- 
ter looks forward to leading the 
campus in an advantageous 
direction. He hopes to provide 
students with the knowledge 
and hands on experience to 
strengthen their major in An- 
thropology. 

Sutter gives a briefing of his 
future views and goals he plans 
to bring to the department in 
hopes lo enlighten more stu- 
dents on the fascinating sub- 
ject. As he continues to expand 
on the conversation his eyes 
widen and quickly states, "We 
125 majors, we are a highly 
recognized campus communi- 
ty... "lean tell the compassion 
he has for his newly academic 
position. 

Dating back to 1975, The 
Anthropology club was estab- 
lished on at IPFW. As a result 
students majoring in anthro- 
pology or were highly engaged 
by some of the remarkable ar- 
tifacts, different cultures and 
the application in its everyday 
link to us as human beings are 
still attending today. Sutter 
informs me that the club has 



campus meetings once a week. 

Another great incentive 
when joining the Anthropol- 
ogy club are the provisions 
of lectures, where Dr. Sutter 
takes pan in some of the ori- 
entations. Sutter's influential 
speeches of civilizations past 
open the minds of the stu- 
dents and faculty who seek an- 
swers to related context such 
as linguistics, biological, ma- 
terial advances, and basically 
how these interactions have 
progressed over time. 

When asking Sutter about 
his new promotion and the 
responsibilities that follow, he 
responded with tribute. "I feel 
responsible. .students. ..fac- 
ulty.. administrators. ..and the 
overall campus." 

A life-long dream brought 
to reality. Dr. Richard Sutter has 
expressed his love for leach- 
ing, travel experiences, and 
the purity of Anthropology. His 
admiration for culture contin- 
ues to grow as his love for the 
students who follow the same 
dream. This talented professor 
at Indiana-Purdue University 
continues to draw students 
in, providing the knowledge 
in a flexible and enjoyable 
classroom environment. The 
impact of Sutter's duties as 
Department Chair, are seemly 
thought through. Keeping his 
lingers crossed and head high, 
Sutter intends to strengthen 
the campus. Clearly mat is an 
artifact of education.

Drifting is the worst kind of 
friendship loss; out of nowhere, 
you start to get annoyed with your 
friend, talk less and eventually stop 
all communication out of either 
laziness or because you have grown 
tired of the person completely. 

Think back to when you became 
friends; you could not have always 
loathed this person. In order to 
prevent the relationship from 
drifting, or becoming what is called a 
waning friendship, any further, think 
about the things that you love about 
the person. Why you became friends, 
the limes you shared that made you 
happy, what it is about the person 
that once kept you sane. 

1 feel that it is hard to keep close 
friends in America because of the 
lack of loyally. In America, it is all 
about getting ahead; putting yourself 
before your friends, whether it 
is about romantic relationships, 
money or career. We are all guilty of 
putting ourselves before our friends 
at some point or another, in some 
other countries, people are more 
concerned with enjoying their lives 
with what they have -- spending 



quality time with family and friends 
-- rather than constantly trying to get 
ahead. 

So when you and a good friend 
start to drift, just remember the 
reasons you became friends in the 
first place; remember that it probably 
was not even a change in you or 
the other person. It was probably a 
situation that did not go as it maybe 
should have. 

BOY: Friends drift apart for many 
different reasons. It is a part of life. 
Eventually, you will need more 
things that keep you together other 
than the fact that you guys go to 
the same school. It is not anyones 
fault really. Life is about growth and 
development and you can't always 
expect to grow at the same rate or 
in die same direction as all of your 
friends. Maybe you guys had that 
one big fight because one of you 
was more mature than the other at 
that time. Maybe you realized after 
awhile that you guys didn't have as 
much in common as you think. Or. 
like I said before, you guys just grew 
in different directions. Whatever the 
case, it happens and although it is 
hard to swallow, it is a reality that you 
will have to face. Just keep the love 
inside you. Maybe all you can do is 
talk every once and awhile, but as 
long as the loves still there, you will 
always be just as close with them in 
your heart And who knows, maybe 
after a little space and time to grow, 
you guys can reconnect one day, and 
pick up from where you left off.

It's a Great Pumpkin 



By Jason Ward 



Halloween will soon be here. Leaves 
an? falling from trees and costume 
stores are popping up in strip malls. 

Some of these stores are tucked 
away in a comer of a mall: others are 
quite prominent with brightly colored 
signs. Some of the stores have lots of 
costumes while others have not so 
many. With so many options, what is 
the best place 10 go. and which store 
has what things? 

Halloween USA. located across the 
street from Glenbrook Mall on Colise- 
um, has masks, wigs. hats, makeup and 
jewelry. Make your own costume or 
buy one prepackaged, they even have 
his and hers costumes so you can be 
the eggs to that special someone's ba- 
con. 

The fitting room is a nice feature 
and surely best to find the right fit. 
Smoke machines and spooky goblets, 
for example. Halloween USA truly is 
one stop shopping for all ghoulishly 
scary endeavors. 

Halloween University at Parnell and 
Coliseum is a smaller store and a bit 
less intimidating. 

"We (Halloween University] are a 
locally owned Halloween shop |that 
is) affiliated with the Columbia City 



Haunted tail." staff memher Kyle F_s- 
selburn. The shop sufl i-. icn helpful 
and has an expanded selection of cos- 
tumes that can be ordered from one of 
many earnings, provided that Ordering 
is dune in time tu nxelVG the costume 

before Halloween. 

In the back of the store is the ike] 
eton and horse from the t .nlumlii.i I'in

in decorating ihe store. With a limited 

selection, helpful staff, and fun .1 re 

tions throughout die store. Halloween 
University is well worth a stop. 

lust a bit further from campus is Cel- 
ebrations Party Outlet near Jefferson 
Point Mall. Celebrations I'.ulv Outlet 
has a great many party accessories in- 
cluding costumes and decorations for 
Halloween. The selection Is not overly 
vast large, but they do have prop chain 
saws and plastic chains among other 
difficult to find things. 

Halloween is sure to be frightful, so 
long as a costume is worn. This Hallow- 
een should certainly be no exception. 
Whether it Is Halloween USA. Hallow- 
een University, or Celebrations Party 
OuUet that's chosen, Halloween is in 
the air. Masks are anxiously waiting 
for bright new faces. Capes, top hats, 
and funky plastic jewelry arc all wait- 
ing their time to shine for that one mo- 
ment, that one day where it is ok to be a 
clown or a vampire. 



Smoke Hut Diaries 



By Robin Crowell 



misunderstood hut: which is located 
in the middle of the parking lot by Neff. 
The only reason that I have ever used 
this hut is walking from the parking lot 
to one of my classes and It was simply 
for putting out my cig in one of their 
ashtrays. Never have I spent lime 
in this one. nor do I see anyone else 
spending time here. 

On thai note, being that there are 
two main smoke huts and people do 
have their preferences on which hut 
to attend on a regular basis, people 



Individuals become partial to 
specific things in life. For example, 
as there are two main IHOPs located 
in Fort Wayne, (we will not include 
the one located on Jefferson, it is not 
open 24 hours, so it does not count) 
everyone has their preference of which 
IHOP they would rolher spend their 
late evenings. Sometimes taking in 

the somewhat trashy offerings of the become very particular on their hut.

Students taking classes in the Visual 
Arts building may notice a new face 
strolling down the hallway this semes- 
ter. Matthew Walsh, or Doctor Kobra, 
as some of his students refer to him is a 
limited term lecturer in Package Design, 
Computer An and Design and princi- 
pals or Graphic Design. 

Walsh received his Bachelors from 
Indiana University Purdue University 
Indianapolis and went on to receive his 
Masters from Cranbrook Academy of 
Arl in Bloomfield Hills, Ml. 

Walsh's interest in the graphic design 
stems from the versatility that it offers 
to its practitioners. "Graphic Design 
can do anything; any of the other dis- 
ciplines can fall under'graphic design 
because you arc compiling everything 
together, said Walsh. Out of all the dis- 
ciplines within graphic design Walsh is 
most drawn to working in the field is ty- 
pography -the visual design of the writ- 
ten word. 

He recently traveled to Portland to 
record Some OThJS urinal spoken word 
poetry (you can listen to his spoken 
poetry at http://www.youtube.com/ 
jfkobra#p/a) and print a broadside to 
accompany it. 

"[His art| is about making people 



laugh." said Walsh. Comparing himself 
to that of the historical Shakespearean 
fool, "He's the only guy who could talk 
[badlyl to the king, the only one who 
could speak power to the truth be- 
cause it was couched in humor." What 
this analogue boils down to is Walsh's 
an combining information- heavily 
aligned In history-with humor. Which, 
if you think about it, is the purpose of all 
art, whether it is literary, fine art, theatre 
or graphic design, art is a commentary 
on reality. 

Walsh is not a big fan of displaying 
his art in galleries because it restricts his 
ability to share his work with large num- 
bers of people. 

"I would rather see work in a book or 
magazine, where you can spend more 
time with it." he said. 

At the core, Walsh is a traveler, never 
maintaining a single job for more than 
a couple months, not because he does 
not work well with others or because he 
is not good at what he does, but because 
it is his nature be a freelancer. Matthew 
Walsh is like the traveling bard from 
Shakespearean times, only staying in 
one spot long enough to tell a story and 
then move on to chase the horizon. 

For now, Walsh is content 10 teach 
because it lets him talk to people, gain 
new knowledge about the world 
around him, about him 
self and about his own 
work.

Nothington 



The Band Under 
the Radar 



Artist: Nothington 

Album: Roads, 
Bridges, and Ruins 

Label: BYO 

Release Date: 
October 6. 2009 

Sounds Like: 
Melodic punk rock 
with the nuance of 
lyrical prowess. 

Rating: 3.5/5 




This album bleeds 
energy. Seeping out from 
underneath the rasp of 
singer lay Northington's 
voice is all of the intensity 



and desire a singer of 
this genre should have. 
It barrels toward the 
listener like an oncoming 
train. 

Musical elements 
of the album are pretty 
conventional. This is not 
to say that the musical 
aspect of this album is 
bad, it just does not stand 
out as really anything 
new or exciting. It has 
jam quality: so if the 
listener is rocking put to 
this album on a road trip, 
they would not be able to 
sit still, but it is nothing 
more than typical. 

Although typical, 
there are moments 
of soaring guitars 
and breakdowns that 
showcase the vocal 
srylings aptly. The 
majority of the album 
is pretty fast paced: 
however songs like 
"Stop Screaming" offer a 



slower dose of awesome 
for those whose ears 
are not pleased by the 
album's other offerings. 
Nothington also does 
really well to make sure 
that everyone in the 
band gets at least their 
fifteen seconds. "This 
Conversation Ends" 

opens with percussion, 
yes, however the 
bass line during the 
percussion introduction 
is more than audible and 
it exhibits the bassist's 
ever fast fingers, also 
showcased intermittendy 
throughout the song. 

Nothington is a band 
still very much under 
the radar, however on 
November 19* they will 
be gracing Fort VVayne 
with their presence 
performing at The Brass 
Rail with local band 
Aadia. show starts at 8

It was a surpnse 
the fact that this album 
quickly made its way 
into heavy rotation 
on the ever popular 
iTunes playiist -- a large 
surprise indeed. 

This album begins 
very slowly and Built to

for being a band with a 
slower pace, definitely 
more laid back sounds 
than are typical of my 
musical likings. With that 
said, this album made the 
wet, dreary autumn days 
that have been plaguing 
the general vicinity seem 
satisfactory.

Roommate's Pick: 



Jeff Pianki 



By Mark Cox 



A couple of days ago, I was sent 
a link to a YouTube video from a 
friend of mine. Figuring it would 
be a clip of someone gelling him or 
something ridiculous beyond be- 
lief, I was hesitant to open it. Upon 
opening it I found a scrawny red- 
headed.boy with a guitar as he be- 
gan to play us a song he wrote only 
a half an hour before in which the 
song, "was originally intended as 
more of a journal entry than any- 
thing," said leff Pianki. the young 
musician from Milford, Michigan. 
All of his recordings are from an 



acoustic guiiar and a hint of cello. 

Pianki talks of how he does not 
take himself very serious in life and 
shows this by making m.iny jokes in 
his "about me" section stating how 
he lives in a state that looks like a 
poorly knit mitten and cried dur- 
ing Homeward bound, although 
his assumed dedication from those 
statements is not seen in his mu- 
sic. His songs are meaningful and 
come straight from his heart from 
his everyday situations. 

"Playing music is one of my fa- 
vorite things on the planet, it is just 
so much fun," states Pianki on his 
MySpace music profile. 

Most of his songs are avail- 



Although he does not have U) il 
bum currently out. I downloaded 
the single songs to give them ■. 
chance and was amazed at what 
I had found. If I were to compare 
his sound to two popular musk* 
groups I would have to say he is a 
mix of Bon Ivcr and Sufjun Stevens 
"Seeds in the Ground" is a really 
great track that is my favorite of his. 
which seems like he is dreaming In 
retrospect of a man thai he used Hi 
know and is now different and not 
a part of his life. The cello was also 
a great touch to his guitar play- 
ing. Go lo his profile, check out his

Lucero: 

1372 Overton Park 



Artist Lucero 
Album: 1372 Overton Park 
Label: Republic 
Release Date: October 6. 2009 
Sounds like: Lynyrd Skynyrd 
integrated a horn section. 
Raring: 4/5 




Lucero does a great job of taking 
the 'white trash' out of southern 
rock. The thematic elements still 
circle around drinking too much 
whiskey, women, and wandering 
around the city streets however 
with the release of thb album, 
Lucero seems to be drawing from 
a new vein entirely. 

Front-man Ben Nichob' voice 
is noticeably more gravelly on this 
album all the while the musical 
implements are far smoother than 
albums past. Abo. new to Lucero's 
repertoire, the integration of a 
horn section and more utilization 
of 'honky tonk' piano: thb adds 
a swank vibe to the album as 
opposed to drunken recklessness. 

Sad songs are there, few and 
far between though. "Can't Feel A 
Thing" and "Goodbye Again* stand 
out as tracks of mourning, however 
for every missed opportunity 



a breath 

of fresh 

air... 



and failure lie tracks of friendly 
camaraderie and drinks over good 
conversation as illustrated by The 
Devil and Maggie Chascarillo* and 
"lohnny Davb, both of which are 
very upbeat tracks immediately 
following solemn tales of numbing 
oneself and desperation. 

Being a band straight out of 
Memphis, Tennessee it b hard 
to get away from the southern 
rock aspect of their music. It is 
enjoyable, yes, and thoroughly at 
that. The only complaint is that it 
has been done before. There never 
will be another Lynyrd Skynyrd 
(though they are still trying) or 
Allman Brothers Band, but it is 
still fun to hear a refreshing twist 
on the genre. Thus, in the realm 
of pop-rock and nu-metal splayed 
all over the airwaves, 1372 Overton 
Park is a breath of fresh air.

PBS airs new show called "Arts Weekly 



a 



By Peter Schnellenberger 



PBS wtcweri may notice a new show being aired on 
Sunday nights thai discusses upcoming arts events in 
Northeast Indiana called "Art Weekly". 

"This is the first show of its kind in Northeast 
Indiana," said the show's host and creator, Chuck 
O'Connor, Dean of the college of Visual and Perform- 
ing Arts (or VPA). O'Connor having a heavy back- 
ground in theatre and television set design knows a 
thing or Iwo about the arts and media production. 

I hiving noticed the lack of an existing arts show 
in Northeast Indiana, O'Connor's history and the op- 
portunity that the campus television sludio provides, 
it only made sense for him to start one. 

livery Tuesday O'Connor meets with the pro- 
duction staff in the studio, located in the basement 
of llelmke Library, to discuss the artists to be inter- 
viewed and stories to be told for upcoming episodes. 

Arts Weekly is produced by IPFW students with 
some faculty assistance. The show has three segment 
producers- Even Figg -- Senior Media and Public 
Communication major, Kiowa Ackley - - Senior Media 
and Public Communication major and Veronica Ga- 
t'i-i - Senior General Studies major and loumalism 
minor . In addition, the staff also includes one stu- 
dent director, Nick Henney -- Senior Media and Pub- 
lic Communication major. 

Together they share the responsibility of putting 
together a half hour long broadcast quality television 
show, in only seven days, which is quite a feat espe- 
cially when, like them, you do not get paid to do all of 
that work. 

What they do get in return, is internship credit to-

wards their degrees, but only for this current semes- 
ter. Next semester they will be working for free. That 
does not seem to bother them though calling it their 
"labor of love." 

For Henney, being the director of a PBS show is a 
of pride and experience. 



how excited they are to be getting the hands on expe- 
rience of working on an actual television show and 
not just making coffee runs, like most other interns at 
this stage in their career. 

Arts Weekly broadcasts every Sunday at 7:30 
pm on PBS39- Digital 39.1, Comcast 3 and 240, Fios 



"I do not know anyone who has a show on PBS 3 and 470- and College Access Television Tuesdays at 
under the age of 30," he said. All of the interns noted 7:30 pm and Wednesdays at 7pm.

"week old" and "pizza" you begin to 

wonder, "Do I have health insurance?"

New Chess Club puts the game in 'check' 



By Kelly McLendon 

m-lfndon &gt; iNjg [puirf I inn 

Some of the besl clubs have 
fearless leaders who march 
iliem into the scene of battle 
triumphantly and always end 
up on the other side with a 
smiling face. The chess club's 
bold leader is Joseph Wright, 
who is anything but afraid of 
what people have to say and is 
willing to ensure that his group 
gets the lime and resources it 
needs to (unction. 

He started the group after 
he saw a hidden demand for it. 

"People formed around 
the chess board outside and 
started talking about how 
there used to be a club and 
how it might be a good idea if 
we could start one up again," 
Wright said. 

Putting the plan together 
would prove more difficult 
than originally anticipated, 
even though time went by and 
people were still talking about 
it. 

The only problem was that 
nobody seemed to want to 
take an active leadership role 
to start up the club. Wright ex- 
plained. 

So he stepped up to the 
plate and made it happen. I le 
was looking for something to 



passionately devote his time 
to and he found it. 

"I was debating on wheth- 
er I should use all of my time 
searching for a job. or if I 
should possibly devote some 
of my time to starting an orga- 
nization where people could 
get together and play chess for 
fun." said Wright. "More as a 
social environment, instead of 
a tournament style club." 

All in ail, Wright was trying 
to create a community of like- 
minded folks. 

"I was trying to develop so- 
cial networks for all of these 
people who gathered around 
a chessboard. Really we had 
all already become friends; we 
just needed to formalize it." he 
said. 

Treasurer Chris Knox de- 
cided to join the club and be- 
come a part of the leadership 
side when he realized he was 
in a club thai he really enjoyed. 

"You are always learning 
new things in this club," said 
Knox. "It is a good way to learn 
new strategics and tactics; it is 
very challenging." 

He also likes the way the 
group emphasizes communi- 
ty, as opposed to competitive 
hostility. 

"We are not a largely com- 
petitive group, we are a com- 



munity and we help each other 
learn through our mistakes." 
Knox said. 

Another reason for forming 
the club was the weather. Once 
the winter season had come, 
the giant outdoors board 
would not be a great choice. 

"The only logical option 
was to formalize the group 
when we realized we needed 
funding for winter." Wright 
said. 

He keeps on pushing fur 
changes in the club he orga- 
nized and he is satisfied with 
theresult-fornow. 

"I just decided (his would 
be my own big challenge of the 
year," he said. 

Presently, the club docs 
not have any tournaments 
planned, but they are working 
on it arranging events with dif- 
ferent clubs in the area. 

As a collective of friends, 
the group meets every day. As 
for a formal club meeting time, 
they meet on Thursdays from 
1 1 a.m. to 6p.m. From 1 1 a.m. 
to 3 p.m.. they use space on the 
second floor Walb lounge and 
from 3p.m. to 6p.m., they call 
the Stomping Grounds home. 
The club also typically gath- 
ers on the first floor ofWalb by 
the information desk on week- 
days.

Printing services Department F\/E NTS 
opens its doors to IPFW campus Qn Campus 



ByAnaAguirre 

1guljlaiUsluden11lprw.edu 



When speaking with 
Tom Lecy, supervisor of 
the printing department 
and professor on 
campus, he informs the 
campus that the printing 
services are mainly for 
the convenience of the 
students. He adds. "... 
Not many students 
realize we are even here." 

The printing services 
department started in 
1967. when the Indiana- 
Purdue campus was 
originally located 

downtown Fort Wayne 
on Berry Street 

Lecy smiles and gives 
a briefing that most 
of their achievements 
are based off helping 
students and campus 
staff members. The 
IPFW campus prints 
are produced and 
distributed from this 
small center located near 
the police and safety 
building. 

The services provided 
include resume work, 
large formatting, 

banners, and detailed 
graphic design projects 



that is completed by 
an on the site intem. 
Printing services 

itself is a Non-funded 
department, and fully 
attempts to complete all 
received projects within 
the day. 

Even though 

the department is 
commonly mistaken 
for the Publications 
Department, there is no 
relation what so ever. 
Most of the work is done 
strictly through printing 
services itself. 

Tom explains that 
the employees working 
fulltime are amazing at 
what they do and he is 
certainly grateful for an 
engaged staff. He also 
adds thai the employees 
possess the abilities 
and efforts to satisfy 
costumers and can be 
rewarded through the 
ripples program. 

When asking about 
any future plans Tom 
gives a "diamond in 
the rough* description 
of an ideal printing 
location located inside 
Walb Student Union just 
for students as a print 
ready shop. Although 
the concept stands alone

cer team fell on Oct. 10 
to Summit League rival 
Oakland 2-0. Oakland is 
now 3-0 in conference 

piny- 

Whelhcr it was a bad 
offensive night for the 
'Dons or a good defen- 
sive one for the Grizzlies, 
it's unsure, but IPFW was 
limited to only four shots 
on goal, spread evenly at 
one apiece for four play- 
ers. 

lunlor Dowling came 
up with three saves 
against Oakland. 

Then on Oct. I5.1PFW 
pulled off a 2-1 victory 
over Cleveland State. 

Going into half-time, 
the board read zero- 
all. This has come to be 
expected with IPFW's 
defense; it's the eighth 
game in 14 this year that 
IPEW has stopped their 
opponent from scoring 
in the first half. 

Sophomore Colin 
Heimlich weaved him- 
self through Cleveland 
State defenders within 
minutes of the start of 
the second half and 
scored his third goal of 
the season. 

Max Touloute 

brought the lead 2-0 in 
the 66th minute when 
he scored after a Viking 
free kick almost went in, 
taking the ball down the 
field and putting it in for 
what would be the game- 
winning score. 

It's his fifth of the sea- 
son, matching his team- 
best of 2008.

utes left in the match and 
a Viking score, the 'Dons

and kept possession for 
the remaining time to 
snatch the win. 

27 fouls were re- 
corded between the two 
physical teams, along 
with six yellow cards. 

Dowling posted two 
saves, while Touloute, 
a sophomore, led with 
eight shots, the team- 
high. 

The 'Dons rerumed to 
action on Saturday, Oct. 
17. They battled through 
110 minutes and ended 
with a non-scoring tie 
with SIU-Edwardsviile in 
Illinois. 

Dowling had three 
saves. The only shot on 
goal for IPFW was posted 



by senior Ben Haifley. 

With about five min- 
utes left in the match. IP- 
FW's Raphael Martinez, 
junior, and freshman 
Brent Helton were issued 
yellow cards as Cougar 
Peter Kelly was dealt a 
red card ejection after a 
dispute on field. This put 
the 'Dons one man up for 
the remaining minutes, 
but they were unable to 
capitalize with a score. 

Touloute had four 
shots and junior Liridon 
Qafleshi shot three. 

For the 'Dons, Sum-

With a five set vic- 
tory against UJPUI on 
IPFW's Pink Out night at 
Millard Gates Sport Cen- 
ter on October 10, the 
women's volleyball team 
travelled to the Dakotas 
last weekend for confer- 
ence matches against the 
lackrabbits from SDSU 
on Friday night and the 
Bison from NDSU on 
Saturday night. 

On Friday, IPFW got 
off to a good start with 
a 5-2 lead playing con- 
sistently well by using a 
balanced offense, to take 
the game under con- 
trol. Struggling to finish 
the first set, the Dons 
had to score some extra 
points to tie the knot at 
30-28 after facing sev- 
eral game points against 
the lackrabbits. With the 
first game on their side, 
the team around seniors 



blocking tactics from the 
Bison. Playing a strong 
and fast offense, the Bi- 
son made it hard for the 
IPFW defense to keep the 
ball in play. Despite the 
exciting atmosphere by 
playing in front of 1,147 
fans in the Bentson Bun- 
ker Fieldhouse. the Dons 
fell 25-19, 25-11, 25-21 in 
the toughest loss of the 

At this point of the 
season, having the con- 
ference tournament 
coming closer, the IPFW 
women's volleyball team 
still has good chances to 
qualify as one of the top 
four teams in the league. 
Now being tied for third 
place with 1UPUI be- 
hind North Dakota and 
Oakland. IPFW needs to 
perform well in the up- 
coming games this week- 
end to stay on top of Oral 
Roberts who arc ranked 
fourth in the conference. 

Concluding from last 
weekend's test against 
North Dakota, senior Re- 
bekah Roehm is aware 
of the fact that: " even 
though the tournament 
is approaching fast, there 
is still enough lime to 
make efficient changes 
in order to succeed In 
die tournament. Every- 
one has to accept this 
challenge and keep up 
the hard work for the re- 
maining weeks ahead." 

The Mastodons re- 
turn to action on Friday, 
October 23, at the Mill- 
iard Gates Sports Center 
when the host Centenary 
to open a three-match 
weekend that also in- 
cludes home dates 
against Oral Roberts (Oc- 
tober 24), and Missouri 
State (October 25). 



Rolling Dons Lose Twice

The IPFW women's 
soccer team has been 
dominant lately, there's 
no doubt about that, 
but in two games this 
weekend die Lady Dons 
proved rhat on any given 
day, anything can hap- 
pen. The action all start- 
ed Friday night at Heff- 
ner Field as Oral Roberts 
Un i v e rsi ty was we lco m e d 
to chilly Ft. Wayne. The 
first half looked just like 
the team who had won 
three gomes in a row 
not too long ago. In the 
20"Tninuie, freshman 
standout Lisa Under- 
wood deflected in a free 
kick from 25 yards out 



(torn Ali Okihiro. That 
would be all the scor- 
ing for the first half, and 
time would turn to the 
61"minute and it was 
Lisa Underwood once 
again coming up big for 
the dons when she broke 
loose from the ORU back 
line and put a shot past 
their goaltender and 
gave IPFW a 2-0 lead. 
ORU would later net 
two goals in just three 
minutes, and then six 
minutes into overtime 
ORU would put the game 
away on aWhitney Booth 
goal from ten yards away. 
On Sunday. 
IPFW ran into a very tal- 
ented Centenary College 
team for a big opportu- 
nity to rebound from a 
loss, and send IPFW's 
seniors out with a win 



on their last game at Hef- 
fiier Field. All the scor- 
ing in this one wouldn't 
happen until late in the 
game, and two goals in 
four minutes would put 
the Lady Dons in a 2-0 
hole with just under 20 
minutes left of regula- 
tion. In die 77Tninute. 
scoring her third goal of 
the weekend, Lisa Un- 
derwood put the ball in 
the back of the net off a 
corner kick to bring the 
deficit to one. Unfor- 
tunately for the senior 
lady dons, that's how it 
would end. and Cente- 
nary College would get 
away with a victory. The 
IPFW women have four 
remaining games on the 
road before starting con- 
ference tournament play 
November 6.

Athletic department due for improvement 

Improvements to be finalized in late fall of 2011 



By Monica Gerdeman

His hand reached for 
ihe loclcei room door, 
athletic director Tommy 
Bell claimed [he alhleiic 
department was due 
for a much needed im- 
provement. The door 
opened the duller over 
whelmed the room see- 
ing that every locker was 
jam packed and even the 
center of the floor was 
full of used towels and 
practice uniforms. 

"We are not Michigan 
State spending a million 
dollars on the men and 
a million on [he wom- 
en with flat screen TVs 
and jalousies, but we arc 
just glad to get the new 
carpel and new lockers," 
said Bell. 

The new aditetic and 
student services building 
will be large enough to 
fit our current sports fa- 
cility within its walls, so 
in reality as the building 



is completed, between 
the two, the space will be 
doubled. The new facility 
could have the potential 
to host a 3000 person 
concert inside. It's that 
big. 

About 1000 people 
go through the cur- 
rent weight room, track 
and elliptical area each 
day, as well as the time 
that our student ath- 
letes need to do their 
daily practice routines 
and workouts. Doubling 
the size will give the stu- 
dent body and athletes 
more of a personal sepa- 
ration and more impor- 
tantly extra space. 

"There have been 
some questions," Bell 
commented, "I've had 
a faculty staff member 
stop in and say diere's 
been a lot of rumors go- 
ing around about the 
new student services 
project and building. 
There will be some ad- 
ditional construction to 



enhance student athletes 
and their experience, but 
we are not taking away 
from Ihe siudenl recre- 
ation. We are going to 
have some new ameni- 
ties, some offices, and 
a great big facility that 
is going to help our in- 
ter mural and recreation 
programs become a lot 
better." 

One new 
addition to 
the siudenl 



up games, which will in the door and check 
not only allow what is right in and right away 



jrrently run for Ihe in- 
tramural program but 
opens the opportunity 
for much more. 

"The intramural will 
grow even larger with 



■here will be different 
stations of equipment 
because our use is going 
to be enormous." 

Although renting a 
locker space will no lon- 



the addition of that new ger be long term, there 
facility, more basketball, will still be full length 
more volleyball, more lockers for daily use as 
of what we, have but needed. There will also 
still be the Men's and 



will be the

better inter

grams. Be- 
cause Gates

ketball, and Mens Volley-

ity, there will be several strictly for student recre- 
courts dedicated to pick- ation. Where they come 



Women's lockers 
room and changes 
spaces complete 
with showers. This 
too will still be avail- 
able for faculty and 
staff. 

"The student 
experience will be 
much belter now 
that they are not all try- 
ing to use this one small 
facility ihey will have 
the big student services 
building." commented 
sports information di- 
rector Rudy Yovich. 

One of the biggest 
reasons for the improve- 



ment is the upcoming 
receriificalionoflPBVIu

top of the NCAA list for

top of their list. They look 
at the locker moms and 
any other rooms 01 arcnj 
available to give IPFW an 
identity. 

"I would like tothunk 
[PFYVfe Siudenl Govern- 
ment for Ihe help with 
our beautificuiion fund- 
ing. They huve allowed 
us to put up murals and 
buy paint for our athletic 
offices locker areas and 
halls, They have been 
a huge part In making 
our current facility look 
as wonderful as it does, 
and they will continue 
in helping us improve." 
said Bell. 

The much needed 
improvement will be fin- 
ished in ihe lale fall of 
2011 or early In 2012.

An alligator bit off part of a golfer's 
arm as he leaned over to pick up his 
ball at a private South Carolina course. 
Wildlife workers killed the alligator and 
retrieved the arm in the hopes it might 
be reattached. The gator pulled the 
golfer into the pond and ripped off his 
arm in the struggle. His golf partners 
were able to free him. The golfer was 
in his 70s.
