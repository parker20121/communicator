Program recruits greater company participation 



By DEBORAH A. ST ARKS 
Chief Reporter 

"There has been a 12 percent in- 
crease in the number o( companies who 
will be participating in the on-campus 
recruitment program for seniors and 
alumni this fall al IPFW, said Linda 
Scott, coordinator placement services 
at IPFW. 

This increase is in comparison to the 
number of companies who interviewed 
students at IPFW last fall. 

"Some companies have reduced their 
campus recruitment because the 
economy is good. We are pleased to 
have 53 companies participating in our 



on-campus interviews this fall." said 
Scott. 

"This is the second year for our pre- 
selected interviews. Companies select 
the candidate they want to interview," 
said Scott. 

"The pre-selecled interviews have 
been received well by both the com- 
panies interviewing and the students 
being interviewed," she added. 

Scott said the companies like the 
process of selecting people who meet 
their needs by looking at their 
resumes, and consequently, the 
number of companies who are willing to 
interview has increased. 

Companies expose students to a more

A local woman was disarmed and 

brought into custody after she pulled a 
weapon from her purse in the presence 
of IPFW police chief, Larry Gaff. 

On Oct. 16 at approximately 4 p.m., 
Gass was transporting the woman, an 
IPFW employee, to her residence al 
her request he says. Gaff had been 
called for aid by the woman's super- 
visor. 

"I felt she was under considerable 
stress," Gaff said. She became 
agitated and pulled a ,32-caliber 
handgun out of her purse. Gaff says he 
disarmed her and arrested her. 



While moving the woman from his 
vehicle to the University police office. 
Gaff said he was approached by a man 
claiming to be a Communicator 
reporter. The man interfered with 
Gaff, causing him to briefly lose 
control of the woman. Gaff says he 
quickly regained control and brought 
the woman into the police office. 

The woman, who Gaff says was 
obviously confused and needed 
assistance, was then transported to 
Lutheran Hospital. She has been 
committed by the courts " for 
psychiatrictreatment. 

Editor's Note: The man claiming to 
be a Communicator reporter is not on 
the Communicator staff.

realistic method of being selected for 
an interview. 

Students have received the method 
well because Ihey have access to 
having the university mail their 
resumes free, students can still be 
considered for interviews even if they 
don't meet the advertised degree 
requirements by writing a letter to the 
company and asking for an interview, 
and students also have the opportunity 
to interview when their resumes aren't 
chosen. 

Sometimes unexpected job openings 
arise within a company. This provides 
the opportunity for the additional in- 
terviewing of other candidates besides 



those the company has previously 

All company interviewers fill out an 
interviewing record for each candidate 
Ihey interview, which gives immediate 
feedback lo students. If students feel 
they cannot write good resumes, 
workshops and help are available 
through the placement office. 

On Sept. II, 1935, a list of companies 
interviewing was pasted on the bulletin 
board outside of the placement office. 
Handouts were also available in room 
113 of Walb Memorial Union. 

Students who were interested in in- 
terviewing left resumes in the folder of 
each company they hoped to reach. 



This was done prior to Sept. 18, 1985. 

On Sept. 19, 1985, mailings which 
included students' resumes were sent lo 
each company. About 1200 resumes 
were sent out. 

Companies decided who Ihey wanted - 
lo interview from Ihe resumes. They 
then contacted the placement office 
with the names of selected candidates. 

A list of selected candidates was once 
again posted on the bulletin board 
outside the placement office on Oct. 9, 
1985. 

Students whose names appeared on 
this list should contact the placement 
office before Octobe 14, 1985. 



Some students who were to be in- 
terviewed on Oct. 10, 1985, have already 
been contacted by the placement office. 

"There are listings from almost all 
disciplines at IPFW," said Scoll. 

Someof the companies contacted last 
summer and interviewing at IPFW are 
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Ernest &amp; Whinney, 
Drees, Robinson and Perugini, and CTS 
Corporation. 

On-campus recruitment is done twice 
a year. If you missed the first session, 
the next one will be Feb. 24-April 11, 
1986. For further information contact 
the placement office, room 113 of the 
Walb Memorial Union.

Forum discusses Star Wars technology 



By EARL SMITH 
Chief Reporter 

"The Soviet Union has been conducting similar research for some time," said 
Julius Smulkstys while discussing why the United States should support a program 
of Star Wars technology. 

Smulkstys, dean of Arts and Letters at IPFW, and Van Coufoudakis, professor 
of political science at IPFW, were the featured speakers at the Chamber of 
Commerce Third Thursday Forum on Oct. 17. 

Star Wars technology is the name applied to a defense system promoted by 
President Reagan called the Strategic Defense Initiative ( SDI ) . 

Coufoudakis, speaking against SDI, said it involves potential violations of in- 
ternational treaties including the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile t ABM ) Treaty. 

Weapons systems are developed to prevent political "blackmail" by another 
country, said Smulkstys. "The key to nuclear defense is deterrence," he said. A 
Reagan administration statement said an aggressor's uncertainty whether our 



defenses could be penetrated would be substantially increased with SDI, thereby 
making a system of ballistic missiles obsolete and impotent. 

Our current weapons systems are based on the concept of mutually assured 
destruction IM.A.D.J, SDI is a means of defense based on destroying weapons 
rather than destroying cities, Smulkstys said. 

1 "Very effective defense could reduce substantially the possibility of nuclear 
conflict," said the administration paper. 

Coufoudakis gave several reasons why SDI would not provide an effective 
defense system. "SDI increases the risks of nuclear war by creating perceptions 
that the United States is aiming at a first strike capability, " he said. 

Counter measures are likely to destroy any SDI advantages, Coufoudakis said. 
Other systems could be developed which would eliminate the advantages created 
bySDI.hesaid. 

"There are questions as to the effectiveness of SDI under battle conditions," said 
Coufoudakis The United States would be faced with the option of spending billions 
of dollars without knowing the end result and militarizing outer space, he said. 



AIDS task force seeks to support victims 



By CAROL KOENIG 

Staff Writer 

Viclims of AIDS suffer from more 

than just the medical symptoms of their 
disease. There is an emotional 
devastation that takes place, as well as 
a physical one. Victims may become 
isolated from their friends and com- 
munity due to the fear surrounding this 
fatal disease which has stricken 13,000 
people in the United States to date. 

The Fort Wayne AIDS task force 
seeks to lend support to AIDS patients 
and their families and friends. 

Formed in March of 1985, the com- 
munity-based task force has a two-fold 
purpose — lo provide help lo AIDS 
victims and their families and to 
educate the community about AIDS. 

The task force is composed of about 
30 local people with varying 
backgrounds and skills. Ministers, 
lawyers, homosexuals, social service 
people, psychologists and medical 
personnel work together with com- 
passion to do whatever they can to 
make things easier for AIDS patients 
and their families. 

Some task force members have 
received Hospice training and provide 
direct service to victims and their 



families. Service to an AIDS victim 
may mean visiting him In the hospital 
or providing home care. Task force 
members can administer medicine, 
obtain social or medical help, sit and 
talk, or go out for groceries if that is 
what is needed. The task force has 



provided services to three families in 
Fort Wayne and is now working with 
only one, according lo Steve Lewis, co- 
chair of the task force. 

The task force also sponsors a sup- 
port group for family and friends of 



AIDS in the classroom 

By CAROL KOENIG 

Staff Writer 

The Indiana Stale Board of Health believes it is possible for a child with AIDS to 
attend school. 

"The kind of contact that occurs in the classroom does not transmit this 
disease," said Dr. WoodrowA. Myers, Jr., Indiana State Health Commissioner as 
he spoke to a gathering of school personnel in Fort Wayne Oct. 22. 

The State Board of Health issued voluntary guidelines for schools to use if they 
should have a student who is a victim of AIDS. Schools will make their own 
decisions, "We need to consider the general slate of health of ihe child in these 
situations," says Dr. Jane Irmscher, local health commissioner. "The initial 
decision should start with the physician and parents." 

AIDS is a retro-virus which has infected 53 people in Indiana, 29 of whom have 
died. It will continue to double its victims for a minimum of four to five years 
according to Myers. 

Myers, former Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of California at 
San Francisco, helped to set up the first ADDS care center at San Francisco 
General Hospital before coming to Indiana in February of 1985 to serve as health 
commissioner "AIDS has become a social, moral, and religious question," said 
Myers. "The state board of health is providing the best public health information 
available." 



persons with AIDS. It is run by two 
social workers and meets the first and 
third Wednesday of each month. "We 
have made an impact." said Linda 
Graham, a member of the task force 
and a nursing faculty member al IP- 
FW. "We have given them support and 
helped them through a real rough 
time," Graham said 

Community education is an im- 
portanl goal of the task force. It is only 
through receiving correct information 
that people will begin lo understand 
AIDS and control the spread of rumor 
and fear, says Lewis. With this goal in 
mind, the task force, in conjunction 
with the Purdue nursing department, 
Indiana State and Allen County Boards 
of Health, the Gay Lesbian 
Organization of Fort Wayne, and the 
New World Center, is sponsoring a 
workshop Nov. 23 at IPFW. 

"Myths and Realities, AIDS Con- 
ference '85" will feature Debra Taylor, 
AIDS consultant for the Indiana State 
Board of Health, and Dr. Jerry Soucy, 
clinical psychologist and director of the 
AIDS action project at Howard Brown 
Memorial Clinic in Chicago as keynote 
speakers. The conference will be open 
to the public.

If you do not feel safe 
do not blame our police 



iThey unlock cars for those students 
upfbrtunate enough to have left their 
keys behind, walk students to their ears 
at rtight, jump-start cars too stubborn to 
sta/t on their own, and watch for suspi- 
cions characters on campus. 

jfhey are the campus police. If you 
dop't feel safe on campus, you must not 
know the people at the other end of 
campus extension 5474. 

•Last year, when a purse snatcher was 
very active on campus, they 
apprehended him. When vagrants camp 
out in the TV lounge in the basement of 
Walb, the police usher them out. During 
the great '"killer bee epidemic," a young 
girl- was stung by bees in front of the 
Helmke Library, they were ready to 
rush her to the hospital, in case she had a 
serious reaction. 

! It's obvious that campus police do 



much more than ticket illegally parked 
cars and collect fines. When the national 
organization, the Guardian Angels, 
wanted to locate on our campus, a panel 
connected with the university decided 
we didn't need their services. Why? 
Because our campus police do their job 
so well. 

Other services they provide is to check 
in on students working on campus late at 
night to make sure there are no 
problems. The IPFW police department 
also unlock rooms and buildings on 
holidays for authorized students 

If you ever have a problem with your 
car, or need to be walked to your, call. 

If you see any suspicious characters 
wandering around the campus, call. 

If you want to tell these fine folks what 
a good job they're doing, call 



Greeks shatter the myth 



By JENNY BLAKLEY 

Sport Editor 



! .College pranks, parties, drunkenness, 
aird general obnoxiousness. These terms 
come to most people's minds when they 
Ihink of fraternities and sororities. "The 
population trunks all the active members 
of a fraternity do is make pledges, 
swallow goldfish, dress stupidly on 
campus, and other numerous acts of 
"hazing." Hazing is defined as causing a 
person mental or physical discomfort, 
embarrassment, harrassment or 
ridicule. 

The general impression of fraternities 
and sororities has been cast by such 
movies as "Animal House" and 
"Fraternity Row." Although this may be 
the case in some Greek fraternal 
organizations, people should not 
attribute this image to all fraternities 
and sororities. There is more to "Greek 
life" than the total havoc that exists. 
. There are various social fraternal 
organizations at IPFW. There are two 
sororities, Delta Gamma and Pi Beta 
Phi, as well as two fraternities, Sigma 
Phi Epsilon and Phi Kappa Theta on 
campus. These groups are social 

"organizations, which means they have 
different objectives, unlike a 
professional group, such as the business 
fraternity, Delta Sigma Pi. 
Social fraternal organizations build 

! long-lasting friendships while fostering 

. scholarship; they promote philanthropic 
events both inside the community and 
outside, and comply with college rules. 
Although the aims are different than 
those of a professional fraternity, the 
social fraternity still promotes worthy - 
causes, and provides something else — 
someone to be there when you have a 
problem, to help you out in a difficult 
class and to be your best friend 
throughout college and after. 

The social fraternities on campus, 
which are all national organizations with 

.chapters around the country, have 



various worthwhile projects. Pi Beta 
Phi, for example, takes part in a Bowl-a- 
Thon for Big Brothers-Big Sisters of Fort 
Wayne, and are helping out with the 
Cerebral Palsy Telethon this year. The 
members contribute money to various 
national philanthropic projects each 
year as well, including Arrowmont, a 
famous arts and crafts school. The Delta 
Gammas contribute their time and 
efforts to various services for the blind, 
and donate a part of their money to the 
Delta Gamma Foundation They 
donated brail elevator plates in Walb 
Memorial Union for example 
Nationally, Delta Gamma has an 
Alcohol Awareness program; the Delta 
Gamma Foundation donates money to 
sight conservation and aid to the blind. 
Sigma Phi Epsilon raises money for the 
heart fund by various projects including 
a Monte Carlo Night and the recent 
carnation sale. Finally, Phi Kappa 
Theta is involved in such activities as 
blood drives and the Haunted Forest, 
among others. 

Although the "Pi Phi's," DG's," "Sig 
Ep's" and "Phi Kap's" are m wnbw g- o f-

i — Letters to the Editor 



Ask us - we'll help 

To the Editor: 

I feel I must respond to 
Mr. Motherwell's com- 
mentary in the Ocl. 10 issue 
of The Communicator 
regarding the participation 
of the student body in 
student government. Yes, it 
does take a multi-talented 
effort to make IPFW a 



campus of excellence, and 
yes, perhaps there are 
vacancies in the Student 
Senate. It is to these 
vacancies I wish to address 
the rest of my letter. 

I wonder if any thought has 
been given to the untapped 
resources available here in 
the part-time student body. 
I'm speaking of the non- 
Iradilional student — the 



returning adult or whatever 
label or term is applied to us. 
We are more than the 
sterotype of the frustrated 
housewife with nothing to do 
so we play at going to school. 
These students come to our 
campus with a knowledge of 
business and community 
affairs — organizational 
skills | itry gelling three. 
children ready tor school, 



breakfast prepared and the 
last minute touches on the 
term paper done and still be 



and a desir- 



&gt; be 



here to finish our education. 
Why not encourage our 
participation rather than 
look down your noses at us, 
or, worse yet, totally ignore 
our presence? Let's face it, 
tlys,. is a commuter ,corn- 
miimCv campus and Uienon- 



tradilional student is here to 
stay. We, perhaps more than 
the younger students, have a 
commitment to IPFW for 
being a good school; our 
families, our homes, and our 
businesses are here. We 
have something to say — we 
are aware of the problems of 
the student body — and we 
could help. Just ask us. 

.RitaM.Mayhall 



social organizations, the term "social" 
is not all their membership entails. To be 
a member, you must meet certain 
standards set by the fraternity, which 
doesn't include how many beers one can 
drink before passing out. As previously 
mentioned, the Greek system offers 
much more than just partying, contrary 
to popular belief It offers a chance for 
college students to make long-lasting 
friendships; and in these friendships lie 
the opportunity to better yourself. 

I'm glad I became a member of a 
national fraternity at IPFW, because 
I've discovered these benefits a 
fraternity can offer, and much more. 
Through my membership, I've built my 
confidence and self-esteem, and have 
witnessed various others do so as well. 
College life wouldn't be as rewarding if I 
wouldn't have joined a sorority. I'm 
proud to be a Greek!

Suicide destroys tranquility of family life 



ByKELLlKIRKPATRICK 

Staff writer 

Editor's Note: This Is part 

two of a series. 

Sitting almost motionless, 
head bowed and eyes fixed 
on the floor, Trudi Bragg, 48. 
recalls her son's short life. 

"Steve was 23 at the time 
of his death. He was 
diagnosed as a paranoid 
schizophrenic. One time 
after he'd read a book "The 
Late Great Planet Earth' ' he 
came home and said he was 
the Antichrist. He was 
divorced and had a child but 
all that was going sour 
because of his illness," 
Bragg said. 

Slowly turning her body 
and clutching a shredded 
Kleenex, she continues, her 
eyes squinting as she tells of 
the days prior to Steve's 
suicide. 

"Upuntillhat limeiof the 
suicide), Steve had been in 
and out of hospitals. He was 
on furlough from Larue 
Carter la state mental in- 
stitution in Indianapolis). A 
couple months after he came 
back, he committed 
suicide, 1 ' she said, her voice 
revealing the depth of her 
emotions. 

On Oct. 13, 1979, Steve shot 
himself in the head and was 
pronounced dead on arrival 
at Lutheran Hospital. 
Unable to cope alone, Bragg 
desperately searched for 
help via the Allen County 
Mental Health Association. 

"I asked Ruth Ann 
Sprunger (executive 



director! if there was some 
place I could go to talk to 
someone. That's when she 
told me about the Alliance 
group." 

The Alliance for the 
Mentally HI is a support 
group for friends and 
families of the emotionally 
and mentally ill sponsored 
by the Mental Health 
Association. But Bragg 
decided not to attend the 
group because she thought. 
"Well, here my son's 
committed suicide. What 
will that do to the others (in 
the group)?" Less than a 
year after Steve's suicide, 
Sprunger contacted Bragg 
about leading a new group 
for survivors of suicide 
called "We the Living." 
Bragg agreed to co-lead the 
group with her husband. 

"We the Living" meets on 
the second Wednesday of 
each month at Plymouth 
Congregational Church, 501 
W. Berry St., and has about 
six regular members, 
coming from as far as 
Marion, In., according to 
Bragg. 

The support group has not 
only helped Bragg come to 
terms with feelings of guilt, 
anger and desperation, but it 
has also enabled her to 
support others through 
crises. 

"A lot of my grief came 
when Steve was ill. When 
you come down after the 
suicide, it's like being a 
splattered egg- You need to 
find someone to talk to," she 
said. 




Her husband agrees 
"Something has changed 
and it's changed forever. 
You're never the same after 

A veteran member of the 
group, who asked to remain 
anonymous, said per- 
severence is the key to 
getting well. 

"When my son killed 
himself three years ago, I 
thought my life had ended. I 
kept asking myself, why, 
why, why? But vou never 



find out why because each 
situation is different. You 
keep searching for answers, 
but there are no real an- 
swers. Time is the only 
answer, "he said. 

Support, it seems, is the 
partner to time. 

"There might be 
something buzzing inside 
your head that you're afraid 
to say, like maybe you said 
something you shouldn't 
have and pushed that person 
over the edge. You keep all 



that guilt inside. Maybe 
someone in the group will 
ask what you're afraid to 
and you think, 'Gee, I'm not 
alone.'" 

"People say someone who 
commits suicide is crazy. 
They say that's the easy way 
out. It's not. It's one of the 
hardest ways to go," he said. 

Anyone interested in the 
"We the Living" support 
group should contact the 
Mental Health Association 
or Plymouth Congregational 
Church 



Seats filled with eager, fresh faces 



By EARL SMITH 
Chief Reporter 

Five seats in the Student 
Senate were filled at its Oct. 
17 meeting. 

Sandra Flum, student 
affairs committee chair, 
submitled petitions from 
Carol Harber, Timothv 
Nahrwold, James Ruckel, 
Steven Elser and Polly 
Dean. AffVere approved. 

"I see that most students 
won't take the time to voice 
their opinions i at Senate 
meetings)," Elser said He 
wants to be able to channel 
student comments and 
concerns directly to the 
Student Senate. 

Dean has been deeply 



involved in promoting a 
campus fine arts building 
and would like to see more 
student involvement in 
issues facing IPFW. 

Lisa Sewell reported that 
the Tommy Dorsey Big Band 
will be at the Grand Wayne 
Center on December 6 and is 
co-sponsored by WEZV. 

Three bus trips are 
currently scheduled: the Old 
Oaken Bucket Football game 
at Bloomington l November 
23), the Chicago Shopping 
trip (November 30), and the 
ski trips to Steamboat 
Springs, Colorado (January 
2-9andJanuary 4-l2i. 

Student Senate President 
Joe Motherwell reported he 



has written Purdue 
University President Steven 
Beering. "I urged him to 
allow student involvement in 
choosing a chancellor," he 
said. 

Motherwell read a letter 
from Robert Burton at 
Indiana University, 
Bloomington regarding 
whether or not Indiana 
University should dispose of 
its stock in companies doing 
business in South Africa. The 
Senate voted to refer the 
matter to the legislative 
affairs committee which will 
respond by October 24. 

Vice-President Brad 
Miller said he has been 
contacted about organizing a 



wilderness club at IPFW. 
Interested students should 
contact him at the Student's 
government offices in Walb. 
"I am forming a task force 
on non-traditional students," 
said Miller The task force 
activities will include the 
consideration of concerns 
recently voiced by adult

Rape victims learn to fight 
the violent crime in program 



By CAROL KOENIG 
Staff Writer 
Rape is a crime of violence 
which will claim one out of 
every three women as a 
victim. It is an invasion 
which can rob a woman of 
her sensuality, self esteem, 
sexuality and her own 
personal feeling of security. 

The Rape Awareness 
Program (RAPi, of the Fort 
Wayne Women's Bureau, 
exists to provide support to 
victims of rape and their 
families in a nine county 
area of northeast Indiana. 
Its purpose is two-fold — 
crisis counseling and 
community education. 

RAP has a 24-hour hotline 
for rape survivors. Callers 
remain anonymous. "You 
only need to give your first 
name," said Jeanne Harber 
Porter, director of RAP. A 
[rained counselor will 
respond to your call and 
provide information and 
essential emotional support. 

"If a woman had just been 
raped and called us we could 
go to the hospital with her, 
and we could assist her 
through the legal system if 
she chooses to go that 
route," said Porter. "Rape 
has a rippling effect, it 
touches all aspects of a 



woman's life. We not only 
work with her, but we work 
with her family and friends 
as well," said Porter. 

RAP also strives to 
educate the community. 
They have speakers 
presenting programs to 
schools, organizations, and 
churches almost every week, 
and will speak to anyone who 
requests it. Topics vary 
according to the group. 
They may speak on subjects 
ranging from the psychology 
of the rapist and survivor to 
self-defense and what to do 
and how to deal with being 

A RAP brochure states 
awareness is the most im- 
portant aspect of rape 
violence, and their literature 
and speakers emphasize 
self-protection. Women 
should be aware this can 
happen to them and trust 
their instincts "Most people 
have a gut feeling for when 
there is danger," said 
Porter. "We need to listen to 
that instinct and take safety 
precautions." 

RAP presents a special 
program in self-defense and 
rape awareness It is a six- 
week course designed to 
teach basic self-defense 



techniques 



The 



techniques can he mental as 
well as physical. One goal of 
the program is to make 
every woman a survivor 

Another special program 
is a support group for sur- 
vivors of rape and sexual 
assault. "Turning Point " is a 
six-week, 12-hour series 
designed to help victims with 
all stages of recovery from 
this traumatic experience. It 
is an opportunity for victims 
to share feelings and 
formation with others who 
have been there themselves.. 

The statistics are grim. M 
rapes were reported to the 
Fort Wayne Police Depar- 
tment in 1984. The F.B I. 
says for every one rape 
reported, ten more go 
unreported. 50 percent of 
rape victims know their 
attackers. And the average 
age of a rape victim is only 
14. 

The Rape Awareness 

Program has grown since 
became a part of the 
Women's Bureau in 1981 
"We are touching a lot of 
lives," said Porter. The

Chamber Singers present their first solo concert 




By SEBASTIAN CHAPMAN 
Staff Writer 
A variety of tones and a 
mixture of colorful voices 
highlighted the University 
Chamber Singers ac- 
companied by the Chamber 
Orchestra, in their first solo 
concert performance. 

The first piece was a Motet 
for Two Choirs by Johann 
Pachelbel. It showcased the 
singer's powerful voices 
through an array of high and 
low interacting tones. 



Conductor John Loessi 
appeared to be enthused 
with the selections for the 
concert. "I'vebasically done 
something I have always 
wanted to do with the 
singers," he said. "The 
pieces in this concert won't 
sound anything alike. For 
instance, J. S. Bach's con- 
tain is a very dramatic 
piece, while Vaughan 
Williams' piece is laid 
back." 

The concert consisted of 
baroque and contemporary 



selections from the 17th and 
20th centuries. The per- 
formances expressed a 
variety of moods, from the 
soothing blend of voices in 
the first Fort Wayne per- 
formance of Ralph Vaughan 
Williams' Three Elizabethan 
Part Songs to the robust first 
movement of Bernhard 
Heiden's Divine Poems, 

During the concert, Loessi 
recognized Heiden as the 
only living composer of the 
five. "He was on faculty at 



IU Bloomington. but he's 
now retired, residing in 
Florida the last I heard." 

Following a brief in- 
termission, the group per- 
formed the "dramatic 
Cantata of J S. Bach The 
first movement produced an 
excellent performance by 
the violins and Bonnie 
Cameron performed a 
comforting alto aria in the 
second movement. 

In the fourth movement, 
Joseph Welches performed 
an outstanding bass 



recitative He possesses a 
unique quality that enables 
him to captivate the 
audience His solo carried 
into a duel with soprano 
JoNell Kurtz In the fifth 
movement The Cantata 
ended with the angelic

JPFW students may oc- 
casionally wonder what the 
Student Board of Governors 
actually does with its 
collective time. The fact is, 
any spare time that SUBOG 
has is rare. Most available 
time is spent creating new 
projects and co-ordinating 
various activities for the 
university. 

SUBOG partially consists 
of committee chairperson 
Lisa Sewell and Mary Brant, 
administrator for student 
services at IPFW. "She 
(Brant) is present at all our 
meetings" stated Lisa 
Buckles, the SUBOG concert 
committee chairperson 
"We've been focusing on 



entertainment aspects such 
as music and movies." 

One of the activities 
sponsored by SUBOG is 
Harbor Arbor Days. On 
these days members of 
SUBOG plant trees in dif- 
ferent areas on the IPFW 
campus. This is a yearly 
ritual to help celebrate 
Arbor Day 

"We show children's 
matinees and other movies 
in the Walb Ballroom." The 
movies are shown Saturdays 
and are free to activity card 
holders. The price otherwise 
is $2. Recent videocassette 
releases are currently being 
shown. 

SUBOG also enjoys 
sponsoring locaJ concerts 
"We had Leon Redbone at 



the cement courtyard bet- 
ween Walb Memorial Union 
and the Multipurpose 
Building," Buckles recalled. 
"It was jam-packed." 

Possibly the biggest event 
ever sponsored by SUBOG 
will be the upcoming Tommy 
Dorsey concert on 
December 6 at (he Grand 
Wayne Center. Tickets are 
S10.S0 for students and$I2.50 
for the general public, and 
will be available on October 
25. Sales are limited to four 
per student, and are 
available presently at the 
Sweet Shoppe, Walb Union. 
The tickets will soon be 
available in Ketller Hall. 

"I lived in California, and 
people there always got 
dressed up to go see the big 



bands," Buckles noted. 
"People have really been 
demanding the Tommy 
Dorsey tickets." Radio 
station WEZV is helping 
SUBOG in financing the 
concert. 

SUBOG has used part of 
the finances to purchase 150 
table arrangements from 
Armstrong Flowers for the 
concert, The arrangements 
consist of evergreen, pine 
cones, and hurricane can- 
dles. "I've done all the 
setting up, footwork and 
public relations," replied 
Buckles. 

The Tommy Dorsey 
concert will feature dancing 
and a cash bar. "The cash 
bar is where the individual 
can purchase liquor and 



other beverages," The 
students from SUBOG do not 
profit from the cash bar, but 
the Hilton will since it was 
their idea. 

The table arrangements 
will be given as door prizes 
at the end of the evening. "If 
you pay for a ticket, it will be 
more than worth it with the 
door prize." 

SUBOG members are 
dedicated and work hard to 
bring interesting activities 
and concerts to IPFW 
students and the general 
public. "We are always 
looking for new members," 
slated Buckles. "We are 
Irving to raise the reputation 
of IPFW as a regular 
college We are proud of this 
college and this city."

Although there has been 
some confusion with ticket 
outlets here in the city, 
Ticketmaster has made it 
possible to select "the next 
best seat" for most 
Indianapolis events 

The international com- 
puterized system is being 
introduced to the Fort 
Wayne area through Karma 
Records at 3414 N. Anthony 
Blvd. "We're always having 
customers come in asking 
about tickets for concerts in 
Indianapolis, so we decided 
that Ticketmaster would be 
a good service for the 
community." said Manager 
Calvin White 

White added that tickets 
for any event in Indianapolis 
are available except those 
for the Indianapolis Colts 
games. "No tickets for the 
Colts went on the system, but 
something is being done 
about that," he explained. 

The next concert in 
Indianapolis that tickets are 
available for is the Bodv 



Blast Jam scheduled for 
November B Ready for the 
World, Gap Band, Climax 
and Andre Cymone are just a 
few of the groups appearing. 
"Six or seven groups will be 
at that concert. It will 
probably be an all day 
event," White said. 

The service will cause a 
slight addition to the cost of 
tickets. Usually there will be 
a $1.35 charge for all con- 
certs and only a $1 charge 
for sporting events. Both are 
included in the price of the 
ticket. 

"Most promoters do have 
a service charge. With 
Sunshine promotions it was 
25 cents, but the price has 
been raised to 75 cents since 
a standard has been set for 
all the stores that distribute 
tickets, "he said. 

Sunshine Promotions 
handles ticket sales for 
many of the conerts held at 
the Coliseum. They first 
receive tickets then dispense 
them to various ticket 
outlets throughout the city. 



When they decided to pull 
tickets from the community, 
they left a lot of people 
stunned by announcing that 
Wooden Nickel would be shut 
out. 

"We're not upset about it 
at all," said Barry Sordelet, 
assistant manager at 
Wooden Nickel, "but the 
publicity is kind of 
notorious," Sordelet said 
that Wooden Nickel has a 
"great" clientel and that the 
loss of ticket sales is rather 



insignificant. "It won't hurt 
our business," he added. 

All ticket outlets in the 
area receive 75 cents from 
every ticket sale. "Con- 
sidering the small number of 
concerts held in town and the 
number of tickets we sold, 
the amount of money lost 
can't be significant," said 
Sordelet, "even though we 



were the number one ticket 
outlet." 

Under the Ticketmaster 
system Karma Records 
won't even receive 25 cents, 
In fact, they don't receive 
any proceeds at all. But, 
White feels that the service 
will eventually "pay-off." 
"It's definitely not profitable 
now, but this city really 
needs it."

The Great Pumpkin gets another chance tonight 



By GARY LACY 
Staff Writer 

Halloween has again 
roared its frightening head, 
and goblins and witches are 
prowling the night in search 
of helpless viciims. These 
"creatures" have otherwise 
been spending their lime at 
certain locations in Port 
Wayne 

Some places of residence 
are the haunted house at 
Soulhtown Mall, the haunted 
forest at Franke Park, and 
the haunted castle at St. 
Vincent's on Coldwater 
Road. 

The haunted house in 
Southtown Mall, which is 
open until tonight, is an 
activity sponsored by the 
Fort Wayne chapter of 



Parents Without Partners 
Upon entering the haunted 
house, one notices the dark, 
mysterious atmosphere 
Strobe lights liven up the 
tour as children hidden 
around corners attempt to 
scare the next person 
passing by. Most of the area 
is dark, and not much can be 

Insulation had been placed 
on Ihe floor to give people a 
"sinking" feeling. This 
particular Halloween at- 
traction is geared to young 
children 12 and under, and 
costs $2.00 a person. 

The Franke Park haunted 
forest, which is also geared 
to younger children, also 
ends tonight. Adults can also 



enjoy (his attraction The 
tour is started at Foellinger 
Theatre, where cartoons are 
shown while waiting to be 
taken to the hayride. A row 
of people are taken at a time 
from the theatre to (he 
haunted house, which con- 
tains strobe lights and 
terrifying mannequins. 

The haunted house leads to 
the hay wagon, which takes 
everyone to the forest. The 
forest contains students 
from high school as well as 
elementary students dressed 
in their Halloween attire, 
jumping from behind trees to 
scare (he unsuspecting 
crowd passing through This 
particular attraction costs 



$1.50 a person. 

Possibly the most exciting 
of Halloween events this 
year, the haunted castle 
leaves everyone begging for 
more. Located just off 
Coldwater Road at St. 
Vincent's, it can't be missed 
because of the huge crowd. 

Afler paying the $3 ad- 
mission at the entrance, Ihe 
person is lotd to enter a 
grandfather clock. The clock 
has a door on it that leads to 
the dark, mysterious rooms 
of the "castle," which is 
actually an old church.. 
These rooms include fans. 
which can't be seen because 
of the darkness, (o produce a 
"cold wind" effect. 

One parlicular room has 



black-checkered walls with 
strobe lights flashing at 
every turn. Pressing on- 
ward, one notices several 
narrow passages and a huge 
"spider web" made of rope. 
The grand finale of the castle 
(our is sure to wake everyone 
up. The haunted castle is 
accepting visitors until 
Friday night, and is cer- 
tainly a breathtaking ex- 
perience. 

Looking for some ex- 
citement to cure those blues'' 
The haunting Halloween 
attractions here at Fori 
Wayne are a great way to put 
a jolt of electricity into your 
veins. Come check them out 
before time runs out!
