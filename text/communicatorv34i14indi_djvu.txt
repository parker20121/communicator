Wartell 

meets 

with 

IPFW 

students 



Last Thursday, IPFW 
Chancellor Michael Wartell wel- 
comed IPFW students to an open 
forum and lunch in the Columbia 
Room of Walb Student Union. 

Nineteen students, represent- 
ing

ed the chat. 

The chancel- 
lor's office pro- 
vided pizza and 
soft drinks, and 
after a brief intro- 
duction, Wartell 
opened the floor 
to the students to discuss any ideas 
or opinions they had about IPFW 
and its policies. 

Topics ranged from the future 
of on-campus housing to air-quali- 
ty and equipment concerns in the 
Visual Arts building. 

In discussing the ongoing 
parking congestion during week- 
days at IPFW, Caroline Harlan, 
IPFW Senior and Vice President of 
Finance for IPSGA, proposed the 
idea of developing a shuttle bus 
route for the campus that would 
run between IPFW, Woddbnilgu 
Apartments, and Canterbury 
Green Apartments - nearby apart- 
ment complexes where many stu- 
dents live.

newly raised dormitories and

Smoking 
to be 
reviewed 



The IPFW Student 

Government Association is form- 
ing a three person committee to 
review the campus policy on 
smoking. 

Kyle Richmond, IPSGA 
Senator and Student Legislative 
Affairs Chair, is spearheading an 
effort to revise the current policy, 
which allows smoking anywhere 
on campus outside of public build- 
ings. 

The policy does not, however, 
prohibit smoking immediately 
outside of building entrances, a 
practice that has angered many 
IPFW students who don't want to 
walk through second-hand smoke 
in order to get to their classes. 

The formation of the commit- 
tee was encouraged by Chancellor 
Michael Wartell at the open forum 
he held Dec. 4. 

Many suggestions were made

a wedding dance Saturday night. 



A difference in 
culture adds to 
BSA celebration 



Hundreds of people attended 
another night of cultural diversity 
at IPFW Saturday night as the 
Bangladesh Student Association 
presented Discover Bangladesh. 

Bangladesh is a country 
ruiigliK the size of Wisconsin with 
a population of 150 million, 
according to Ball State University 
Professor M. M. AH — a special 
guest of the night. It is bordered on 
three sides by Indian, and by the 
Bay of Bangal to the south and 
Burma to its southeast. 

About 250,000 Bangladesh cit- 
izens live in the United States. At 
IPFW, the Bangladeshis population 
has been very active in BSA. 

BSA President Mahmudur R. 
Bhuiya welcomed the crowd at 
Walb Ballroom, hoping to give 
IPFW a sample of the Bangladesh 
culture. 

"You will see how colorful is 
our culture and how spicy is our 
food," he said, smiling to the 

"People of Bangladesh are not 
lazy, but are active, social and with 
warm hearts, like me." he smiled. 

It was a celebration of their 
culture as they also celebrated their 
first year of the BSA existence at 
IPFW. The group has been active in 
most activities during the past 
school year, Bhuiya said.

DeVinney was not disappoint- 
ed for long. His film went on to 
win an Emmy for Outstanding 
Individual Achievement in 
Writing. 

In 1996, DeVinney formed his 
own production company in 
Boston that has worked on projects 
for such clients as The History 
Channel, CBS 
News 
Productions, 
A &amp; E 
Television, and 
The Discovery

gets confused 

with "Project Greenlight," which 
was created by Ben Affleck and 
Matt Damon to give struggling 
screenwriters a chance to market 
their talent. 

"Some people saw [Green 
Light Productions] in the phone 
book and confused it with Project 
Greenlight, which came along a 
few years later. Every once in a 
while someone would call looking 
for Ben or Matt." 

The term "green light" is often 
used in the film business to signify 



the 






ety of interna- 
tional traveling, 
DeVinney has 
also worked with his share of 
celebrities. 

"Sam. Waterston ("Law and 
Order") and William H. Macy 
("Fargo") starred in a dramatic film 
I wrote. Michelle Pfeiffer and 
Judith Light have narrated my 
films," DeVinney said. 

DeVinney says he enjoys 
researching and writing films 
because it means he is always 
learning something new. 

"It's a kind ol subsidized edu- 
cation. But that education often 
comes with a great deal of pres- 
sure. For example, in October 1 was 
hired to write a treatment for a MO- 



minute film on Human Evolution. I 
had two weeks to research a topic I 
knew little about and write a 17- 
page document describing a film 
that the National Geographic 
Society hopes to produce, in the 
coming vear,"he said. '" kaiihh 

For those of us who don-'t have 
the opportunity to produce a film 
on location in Rome, DeVinney is 
looking forward to spreading his 
knowledge among the students at 
IPFW. 

"I taught writing for TV at 
Boston University for ten years and 
found that very satisfying. And 
how I'm excited to be part of anoth- 
er first-rate Communications pro- 
gram where I can work with dedi- 
cated professionals and eager, tal- 
ented students to see what we can 
create together." 

Teaching will not slow down 
DeVinney's film making, however. 

"In Boston and Cape Cod 
there is terrific celebration of early 
American history, from Plymouth 
Rock to the battlefields of 
Lexington and Concord. But l think 
Midwestern history is just as excit- 
ing and I hope to develop films that 
demonstrate the significant role 
that this region has played in the 
development of our country," he 

DeVinney is eagerly anticipat-

student input is necessary for the

Canterbury Green, was raised at 
the meeting. Wartell expressed 
concerns about student safety, say- 
ing, "(Students) are going to take 
the shortest route between two 
points, and I have a fear that isn't 
going to be the bridge." 

The chancellor was receptive 
to all the suggestions and com- 
ments, and forthright with the stu- 
dents in attendance. 

Wartell has held these 
"Chancellor's Chats" a few times 
during the academic year for sev- 
eral years, but he still feels more 



do this more 
often," said Wartell, also noting 
that he would like to see more stu- 
dents attend. 

Notices of these "Chancellor's 
Chats" are posted around campus 
several days prior to the meeting. 
and the forum is open to any IPFW 
student. 

For more information, contact 
the office of the chancellor at 481-

Smoking policy to be reviewed 

from Page One 



at the forum, including imposing a 
20-foot perimeter around all cam- 
pus buildings in which smoking 
would be prohibited, or designat- 
ing certain building entrances as 
non-smoking. 

Richmond proposed building 
smoking huts, located away from 
the building entrances, and relocat- 
ing the ashtrays to these new struc- 
tures. He believes that smokers 
would naturally relocate to the 
huts to smoke, not wanting to litter 
outside the doors if there were no 



ashtrays. 

Wartell commented on the 
difficulty of enforcing any policy, if 
enacted. While Richmond *.uggt&gt;t- 
ed having university police issue 
fines to violators, Wartell said he 
would rather find a "kinder, gen- 
tler way of doing it." 

IPSGA held an all-govern- 
ment meeting on Monday, Dec. 8, 
but the smoking policy issue was 
not brought up due to time con- 
straints. The issue will likely not be 
discussed until next term.

'Last Samurai' an epic swashbuckler 



Imagine Japan in file late 
IHOOs. Samurai swords, bamboo 
armor, and a really pissed off 
Samurai lord, Oh, and did I forget, 
Tom Cruise? If you can imagine 
thai, then you are on the right road 
to understanding "The Lasf 
Samurai". 

Located in pristine Japan, the 
meat of the movie takes place- 
between the years 1876-1877. The 
movie opens with drunk Civil War 
Hero Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) 

displaying a Winchester Repeater 

rifle to a crowd of prospective buy- 
ers. After terrifying the crowd with 
his marksman abilities, Algren is 
abruptly tired from his job, His fall 
from grace turns info a stroke of 
dumb luck after being confronted 
by a Japanese merchant who wish- 
es to strike a deal with Algren. 
Knowing Algren's past, the 
Japanese merchant Omura pays 
him to train an army of Japanese 
soldiers and eliminate a rebellious 
Samurai. Algren, needing the money, corr 
plies and guarantees Omura a dead Samur; 
for the enormous sum of $500 dollars 
month. 

Algren raises the army, which inuldn 
conquer an anthill, and is requested to takeo 
the Samurai rebellion, which is at that tim 
iarauding the counrrysidi 




ways of the westerners. In the process, 
Algren and Katsumoto become close friends 
and allies. 

With a change of heart, Algren takes off 
to destroy the army he helped create. After 
many battle scenes resembling "Gladiator" 
and "Braveheart," Algren lies on the final bat- 
tlefield with his dying friend Katsumoto. 

i * T u 7!i V " j • ""'""" '" Wishine In die with honor Katsumoto asks

after a dynam.i las, s llln d against a group of M &amp;™ '" ^ him

falls to the ground and is taken back to the .

.harp object. The 
closes with the Japanese soldiers lower- 
their knees in silence to the fallen hero 
The second to last scene displays Algren hon- 
oring the Japanese Emperor with the sword 
of the fallen Katsumoto. 



The movie closes with a question of the 
whereabouts of the lost Captain Algren. The 
narrator leaves us with a choice of places, 
allowing our imaginations to wonder. 

"The Last Samurai" is definitely the 
movie that will put Cruise on the map of 
Hollywood greats. This movie had every- 
thing an adventure/action junky could ever 
hope for and then some. Amazingly, it even 
had a little bit of a love story running 
throughout it. 

Overall, I would have to say the story is 
definitely worth the visit. The acting, the 
mysticism, the overall mood and presentation 
of the movie provide for a dramatic Eastern, 
swash buckling epic.

Editorial 

The Yin &amp; Yang of holidays 

It's a misnomer that more suicides take place during this time of year than any 
other, but it's an understandable urban legend. Loneliness feels a whole lot more 
hitte during this time of year. 

The holiday season between Thanksgiving and New Year's is one of constant busi- 
ness for major religions in the United States, whether the days celebrated are 
Christmas or Chanukah or others celebrated by America's divergent populations. 

And, no matter what the religion, the significance of the holidays - which are ulti- 
mately based in a hope for the future and a desire to be better to our fellow neigh- 
bors across the street or ocean - is often lost in the bustle of foggy December 
moments. They are the moments caught studying while awaiting a jetliner; pushing 
through the mall for the current toy of the year; or returning to an age of 7 more 
excited by the concept of a present than the appreciation of being home again. 

In the middle of this, we hope for perfection for ourselves and are more upset by 
our circumstances if it doesn't live up to our expectations. We don't stress this desire 
so much so through the year, but our mentality does hinder our basic enjoyments. 

There are millions of people who won't be returning home for the holidays this year. 
Some are away on business. Some are in the military. Some are not able to afford a 
trip home to be with family and loved ones. A few will even be home physically, but 
be unable to deal with relatives on an emotional or spiritual basis due to stresses of 
life. 

It is for these people^tfaveleirs/'sbldiers, w6rkers r and"tl^lr3riely'inside, that'the Holi- 
days should be seen as an uplifting time. 

And it takes very little to raise their spirits. A letter, card or phone call from old 
friends are a high that no amount of carols or fruit cake can fulfill. It is simply an 
acknowledgement to one another that, yes, we still care no matter the distance - 
physical or emotional - between us. 

During these days of December fog, it also becomes difficult to smile to a stranger in 
a crowd, although it also seems more important to do so. It is. Breaking the winter 
ice between us for a smile and a mutual wish of Happv Holidays and a Blessed 
New Year brings us closer to humanity than any gift or television special. In 
responding to that spirit, we uplift ourselves and others. 



Letters to the editor 

4 No one was turned away...' 

In response to Ryan Brown's letter of December 3. 

Ryan, 

In your letter to the editor last week you expressed unhappiness over Homecoming 2003, and 
pointedly with the pre-game party. Are you sure you mean the pre-game parry? 

The official pre-game party, co-sponsored by SAB/1PSGA and the Alumni Association, was 
held at the Coliseum's Appleseed Room from 5 to 6:30 p.m. on November 21 for all IPFW students, 
alumni dues-pavers and season ticket holders. We had 780 students/alumni /season ticket hold- 
ers/children/guests in attendance with plenty of food for anyone who showed up. No one was 
turned away from the buffet tables. No one went to other parties asking students to leave to attend 
this pre-game party -- as your letter states. 

There were on-campus events prior to the pre-game party including Homecoming Central, 
cat decorating/tailgate and a pep rally. 

Are you confusing one of these events as the pre-game party?

Be positive in outlook of life 

i could call this week's column "Words of Wisdom," or "My 
Parting Shots of Advice," or "Best Wislies to You in 2004." But I 
toon 'i. 

Since I've been writing for The Communicator, I've been very 
proactive about you getting involved on campus, registering to vote, 
working out at Gates Center and encouraged you to attend tlw 
iu of let lures, shows and events offered at IPFW. I've told you to 
accept the diversity of the students on campus. 

I've told you to slow dozon, stop filling your life with useless 
activities to stop and smell the roses along your path. I've told you 
my opinion of "reality TV" and expressed that I am truly frightened 
:ve are becoming that "reality. " 

I also wanted you to recognize and honor Veterans, under- 
stand that your time is very precious and acknowledge tlmt you may 
live a "wonderful life. " I've directed you to look for miracles in your 
life, to love and respect others, and even applaud the teaching efforts 
of your instructors on campus. 

I've even asked you to go to Notre Dame to "catch the spirit" 
that you may need toinvigorate your IPFW experience, if you haven't 
light the "IPFW spirit" yet. 

Perhaps my columns didn 't indicate "you " directly, but I 
Jioping to reach out and "touch" someone with my words. Tliegi 

;/ gift any writer can have is to motivate someone to take an action 
due to the "clmllengt" thrown out to them, I can't just rest oi 
laurels of having someone read an/ column and not think about wliat 
is being written. 

It's true that I'm a "non-traditional" student, so mylifeexpe- 
es may be a little more diverse than you have experienced iu your 
life yet-: . . but you will. &lt;r 

As you enter the "holiday season," enjoy your family and 
friends. Reflect on your life to date and project your successful 
endeavors in 2004. Be positive in your outlook on life; be support) 
to your family and friends in need. Do something you 've never done 
before and push your envelope a little bit farther in the next yea. 
Stretch your spirituality, learn something new evenj day, start a daily 
journal and exercise. 

Enjoy your life, do everything in moderation, become a part of 
the "IPFW experience" and you won 't regret it. 

Happy holidays !o my fellow students and best wishes for the 
greatest New Year of your life. There are no limits to what you 
' ' ve in 2004! Noio go after it! 



Have a happy

Ah, all those beautiful holiday thoughts and crap 



Ahhh, the howling winds and 
numb fingers tell me that it's the 
"most wonderful time of the year" 

This means that we can expect 
some of the more famous residents 
of this season at any time. 

Winter means snowmen, win- 
ter wonderlands, and snow angels. 
It also means starting your car half 
an hour before you need to leave. 
It means scraping the ice and snow 
from all of your windows, deicing 
your locks, and hoping to heaven 
that your doors aren't frozen shut. 
It means bundling up like the kid 
from The Christmas Story just to go 
out to let your dog outside to go to 
the bathroom and spending an 
hour regaining your sensations in 
your extremities. It means sliding 
through stoplights, hoping the per- 
son behind you keeps control of 
their car, and finally, sliding and 
spinning your tires through snow- 
drifts across the road. Winter 
means ice skating, sledding and 
building snow forts. 

It also means snow delays, 
emergency kits in your car, 
hypothermia, frostbite, and broken 
bones. It means cuddling by the 
fire and freezing your butt off as 
you meander from class to class. 

Time off from school is one of

snowed in somewhere, stranded 

on the side of the road, or working 

constantly at some job that makes 
you less than happy But before 
you can spend all of your time 
working at some dead end job to 
earn minimum wage, you have to 
suffer through 2 weeks of pure tor- 
ture as you prepare for and take all 
of your finals. 

You know it's finals week at 
1PFW when people are too stressed 
out, exhausted and disinterested 
enough that they don't even bother 
paying attention to you, or con- 
versing. That's so out of the nor- 
mal for the IPFW campus that I 
dread every time they roil around. 
Holiday time means, among other 
things, spending good quality time 
with your family Getting to know 
and spend time with people you've

ed. Sitting 

around the 

house of people 
you barely 

know, making small talk about 
your involvement in activities that 
von finished 5 years ago, means 
one thing and one thing only, it's 
Christmas time. 

Christmas cheer, in every 
form, pours from the pores of every 
living creature. Nothing says cheer 
like fighting other people for the 
last Tickle Me Elmo, and running 
over the little old grandparents as 
they try to get presents for the one- 
day only low sale price of $9.99. 
I isi tighling ,il I he bargain bin, and 
chicken matches in the parking lot 
always make me feel warm and 
fuzzy on the inside. Spending 
money we don't have on gifts peo- 
ple don't need sends the message 
that we care. 

I'd rather have people I know 
tell me that they haven't put them- 
selves into extreme debt by buying 



me yet another orange sweater or a 
bathset that I'm going to turn 
around and give away next year. 
Now, if you want to buy me a new 
car, or finance a trip to Europe, I'm 
willing to accept those gifts as a 
sign of your true affection. 

Gift cards are the greatest 
invention ever. They are easy to 
buy and to redeem; they can never 
be the wrong size. Most people 
don't like giving gift cards because 
they feel like they aren't putting 
any effort or thought into their 
presents for others, but they could- 
n't be more wrong. I love gilt cards, 
because I can buy what I want, not 
what some random aunt and uncle 
thinks would be good for you. 
Then, if for some reason, you don't 
like what you've gotten, you don't 
have to fight the horrendous lines 
at the return counter and deal with 
store credits that you can't use on 
certain items on certain days. Gift 
Cards are just much easier. 

Food makes the season, some 
people say. Food makes us full, 
have indigestion, and gain .10 
pounds. 

Sure, it's great to have such 
awesome spreads of good food, but 
do we really require five different 
types of cheese platters to celebrate 
this time of year. 

When you think about holi- 
days, one of the first things that 



pop to mind are traditions. 
Presents, caroling, and watching 
Christmas movies are some of the 
more commonplace traditions 
They are pretty easy to understand 
and celebrated by most people 
Yule logs? What the heck. Fggnog, 
at first thought seems all right, hut 
have you actually tasted the stuff? 
BLECH! 

Mistletoe, sure a great idea, in 
THEORY, but when would you 
have the stuff? That's right, at par- 
ties. This time of year there are 
mostly company Christmas parties 
and family parties. I don't know 
about you guys, but 1 don't even 
want to think about being caught 
under the mistletoe by my some 
strange male cousin and kissing 
my boss wouldn't be awkward at 
all. 

Many things about this time 
of year make me smile and happy 
to be alive. But not all of them are 
as wholesome as we'd like to pre- 
tend they are. 

I hope you have a great holi- 
day season. May your car start and 
not end up in the ditch, your win- 
dows defrosted, your fingertips 
have feeling, your presents be gift 
cards, and you not get caught

White House playing politics with Iraq situation 



By Leonard Williams 
and Neil Wo 11 man 

Special to The Communicator 

In May of 2002, Vice 
President Cheney warned 
Democrats not to seek political 
advantage from the war against 
terrorism. Now that the Bush 
administration views Iraq as the 
"central front" in that war, the 
news indicates that some people 
are indeed seeking political advan- 
tage from that conflict — despite 
Cheney's warning. It is not just 
the Democrats running for presi- 
dent, though. These days. 
Republicans and the Bush adminis- 
tration are the ones most focused 
on using the war for electoral pur- 

To set the stage, think back 
to the 2002 congressional elections 
when Republicans painted any 
skepticism about the President's 
policies as disloyal and unpatriotic. 
Then, last July, the Washington 
Times quoted Ed Gillespie, chair- 
man of the Republican National 
Committee, as saying that 
Democrats "have crossed the line" 
of acceptable discourse by trying to 
score political points when 
American troops and the Iraqi peo- 
ple are facing life-and-death situa- 
tions. Now, with the start of the 
presidential campaign, Iowa voters 
are being shown television ads pro- 



claiming that: "Some are now 
attacking the president for attack- 
ing the terrorists." 

The national Republican 
Party wants to turn the debate over 
war with Iraq to their partisan 
advantage. Their reasons for 
doing so can be traced to the fact 
that President Bush's popularity 
has declined. It has declined 
because the original rationale for 
the war (large stockpiles of 
weapons of mass destruction) has 
not been supported by any evi- 
dence. His popularity has also 
declined because the postwar occu- 
pation of Iraq has not gone smooth- 

What has been the adminis- 
tration's response to these policy 
failures? Their first response was 
to change the rationale for the war. 
Where the United States was once 
confronting a looming military 
threat, now it is said to be creating 
a free society in an antidemocratic 
region. This argument rarely sur- 
faced until late in the pre-war 
debate, likely because it was not a 
compelling reason for invading a 
sovereign nation. 

Their second response has 
been to schedule a faster transition 
to a new Iraqi government. This 
represents a change in what the 
administration previously consid- 
ered important to establishing a

free and stable Iraq, namely writ- 
ing a constitution and building 
infrastructure over several years 
rather than quickly holding inde- 
pendent elections or hastily train- 
ing Iraqi security forces. Despite 
its earlier statements, the adminis- 
tration has also made a strong push 
to internationalize the Iraqi situa- 
tion. While this would result in 
fewer American casualties, it 
would also let the United States 
shift some blame if things do not 
work out as planned. 

In each case. President Bush 
and his Republican allies have 
denied that they are changing 
direction or acting politically. And 
they have now intensified earlier 
criticisms of Democrats, saying 
that it is the critics of the war and 
the occupation who are (as Sen. 
Orrin Hatch said) "playing cheap 
politics" with national security. 
They argue that Democrats are try- 
ing to make political hay out of the 
administration's difficulties in Iraq. 
At the same time, conservative 
commentators have been hitting 
Democratic presidential candidates 
hard by saying that their 



of administration policy are not 
only unpatriotic, but give aid and 
comfort to "the enemy," 

While accusing Democrats 
of partisan motives, administration 
officials such as Secretary of State 
Colin Powell still assert that the 
advent of new policies in Iraq 
somehow "rises above domestic 
politics." How is this possible, 
when such policy changes clearly 
follow on the heels of daily casual- 
ties for coalition forces and steady 
declines in the President's poll rat- 
ings? In our view, when they say 
it's not about politics, it's about 
politics. The policy change has to 
be political, because prior to Iraq 
becoming a political liability for 
President Bush, the Iraqis were 
said to be not yet ready for self- 
government. 

Can the administration's 
policy shift have occurred (as 
national security adviser 

Condoleezza Rice has asserted) 
simply because there was a "clam- 
or" for self-rule among the Iraqis 
themselves? We doubt it, because 
earlier appeals by Iraqis and the 
international community went 



unheard. Now thai a si/able num- 
ber; of Americans think that our 
country is off on the wrong track 
and that'll may be time to elect a 
Democrat as president, the admin- 
istration's hearing has suddenly 
become better than ever. 

Note that it is not just promi- 
nent Democrats, such as Sen. 
Hillary Clinton, who are calling the 
advanced Iraqi timetable a strategy 
to help President Bush win re-elec- 
tion. Members of Iraq's own 
Governing Council are doing so, 
too. In our view, the administra- 
tion's favorite Iraqi, Ahmad 
Chalabi, has revealed the true rea- 
son for the policy shift toward a 
speedy "Iraqification." As Chalabi 
told the New York Times, the 
"whole thing was set up so 
President Bush could come to the 
airport in October for a ceremony 
to congratulate the new Iraqi gov- 
ernment" — just in time to influence 
the November elections.

Talking Tofurky Holidays 



By Kelly Royal 

Special to The Comr 



Rynn Berry, the historical 
advisor to the North American 
Vt^elari.in Society, s.iys that this 
turkey sacrifice was not always the 
staple of American Thanksgiving 



Each year about 12 n 
Americans will choose to ju 
no tn turkey for the holidays. 

As they sit down to a not-so tradition. "It's true that the Indians 
traditional dinner, they may be provided some deer meat, and pos-

baked pumpkins with wild rice side dishes and not the focus of the

dish is lofu. The closest thing 
they will have to a bird on

Tofurky.

Being vegan, Nikki Hilkey, an 
employee at Ihe Three Rivers Food 
Co-op prefers a 
approach. "I don't

choices," she said. 

Whether it's a natural plant 
based meal as Nikki Hilkey enjoys, 
or a meat substituted entree, 
American consumers are constant- 
ly being presented with reasons to 
break away from all the conven- 
tional ways to celebrate the annual 
fall harvest season, 

Typical vegetarian foods are 
beginning to make clear-cut waves 
in what we know to be typical 
American tradition. 

At one time or another it is 
likely that we will entertain a vege-

veggie friendly foods during a hol- 
iday luncheon or potluck dinner.

First Person 



A Christmas behind bars 



By Joseph M. Dyer 

Special to The Communicator 

I woke up and didn't know 
where I was for 10 seconds. I 

leaned on my elbows and harsh 
light streamed at me through a 
small window. 

Then I remembered: jail. 

I felt 50 pounds heavier when 
I remembered what had happened. 
My pony-tail roots hurt from 
where it had been pulled at during 
my fight just nine hours earlier. My 
arms hurt from strangling the man, 
and I could smell his cologne 
under my fingernails. 

1 had gotten in a fight with a 
relative; a known child-molester 
who couldn't understand why I 
would not let my daughter stay at 
his house. The police and ambu- 
lance came, I was taken away in 
cuffs and paramedics worked on 

told no bail till 
after I saw the 
judge. Any battery 
is treated this way. 
The court was 
closed till 

December 26, three 
days away. I got a milk crate of per- 
sonal items and was lead back into 
the cell blocks. 

It was the first time for two 
things: my first time in jail, and my 
daughter's firsl Christmas. 

I was lead into the dark com- 
mons area of cell-block H. in 
Huntington County Jail. I slept on 
the top bunk, above a nice man 
named Scott. Of all the inmates 
there I was glad he was my, cell- 
mate. He talked to me about the 
books he was reading, and gave me 

I read the entire book in my 
three-day stay; it was, oddly 
enough, about a man named Joe 
who was escaping from a Russian 
prison in Siberia. 

But it did snow on that 
Christmas day; the worst 
Christmas I had ever had - and 



hopefully - ever will have. We 
could see the snow fall down on us 
from the sky-light above. 

On Christmas wu were treated 
to bowls of Rice Krispes and Tang 
to drink, with nothing to do but 
stare at each other. No one to dared 
to look too long. The night before

oth- 



er across the block; the other had 
been making fun of Christmas. 

At lunch-time we all lined up 
and got our dinners; room temper- 
ature ham and cake with white 
frosting and sprinkles. 

I called my grandparent's 
house and talked to my wife, and 
she said it wasn't like Christmas at 
all. My brother was sleeping, my 
grandpa was crying, and everyone 
was whispering about what had 
happened. 

It was surprising to me that 
the inmates were in good spirits. A 
middle-aged man colored a 



I think possibly that 
1 was spared getting 
into a fight because 
it was Christmas. 



Chri 






Dt his stymfoam cup 
and placed it in the 
window for the 
guards to see. There 
were two inmates I 
rarely saw, because 
they took sleeping pills, brought in 
twice a day by the guards. But on 
Christmas, they were out talking 
and playing cards. 

I had made friends with an 
inmate I will call Don. I have no 
clue what his name was, but on 
Christmas we took over the TV. 
There was a Godfather marathon 
on. Parts I and II were on back-to- 
back, so the block endured eight 
hours of mafia action and lingo. 
Other inmates would watch for 
awhile, and then go away. I think 
every inmate sat with us at one 
time during the day, but Don and I 
stayed strong, and made it till 
lights out. 

I think possibly that I was 
spared getting into a fight because 
it was Christmas. To watch TV, all 
there was to sit on were metal pic- 
nit tables Hon and I had our blan- 



kets for cushion, and 1 guess at one 
point I took mine back to my cell. 
Later, my water cup made a wet 
ring on the table, so I took what I 
thought was my blanket and 
wiped it up. 

"Is that my blanket?" another 
inmate asked me who was sitting 
with me and Don. 

"No I think it's mine," I said. 
He gave me a funny look, so I 
jumped up and checked my bunk. 
My blanket was on it, even though 
I don't remember putting it there. I 
came out and said that it was his. 

I sat by him for a few minutes, 
feeling heat off him and waiting to 
see what he would do. He was the 
same inmate who had screamed at 
the other the night before. He had 
just done nine months in prison, 
and was only in jail because the 
computer had said he hadn't paid a 
fine. He was stuck in there and 
away from his kids on a technicali- 
ty. He said nothing else to me. 

The day after Christmas we 
were led across the street in hand- 
cuffs to the Courthouse. My long 
wet hair started to freeze on the 
way over. I took my turn before the 
judge and I watched how long it ' 
look. There is a timer right beside 
him clicking off the seconds. The 
prosecutor said what I had done, 
but from her mouth, it seemed 
much worse and I was scared I 
wouldn't be given bail. All the 
other inmates told me just to ask 
for bail and keep what I said real 

He granted me bail and 
tapped his gavel. The clock 
stopped at one minute and thirty- 
six seconds' Iwas out in less than ' 
an hour after bail was set. 

The whole idea behind not let- 
ting a battery suspect out right 
away is to Stop reoecurring domes- 
tic violence. I understand that and 
agree, it shouldn't be used in every 

The next time you think about 
defending your family, check the 
calendar for the next holiday.

her own record by 21 seconds. 
Fruchey credited Ritchey's off-sea- 
son dedication and conditioning 

The women's volleyball team 
was arguably the University's 
greatest triumph this fall. 
"Hartley's Angels," as they are 
affectionately called, finished with 
an unprecedented 22 victories. 
Amidst a midseason winning 
streak, head coach Kelley Hartley 
was confident the team was capa- 
ble of achieving the 20-victory 
plateau. Those feelings were 
exuded after an impressive win 
over Mid-Continent Conference 
leader Valparaiso on Oct. 21. 

"We challenged the team to 
aim for a 20-win season and they 
were excited and accepted that 
challenge," she said. 

The Angels were unable to 
successfully defend their D-l 
Independent championship, los- 
ing to the Northern Colorado 
Bears. Playing against the team 
from the Rocky Mountain State 
wasn't exactly an easy task, as 
UNC finished their season with a 
32-2 record and 26-game win 

Hartley, who guided the 
'Dons to their first winning, and 
20 plus win season as a Division I 
program, was named 

independent Coach of the year. 
Lindi Bankowski, Fabiana Souza, 
Kirsta Solberg, Sarah Leffers, 
Nicole Ray, and Nicole Howell 
were honored to All-Independent 



The i 

ketball se; 



i and women's bas- 
is have been under- 



way for three weeks, but 
have only one win to show 
between the both of them. 
Inconsistency is the guilty 
party in the 1-12 combined 
records. Neither seems to 
have the offense and 
defense on the same page 
on a given night. One 
night, it will be the 'Dons 
shooting 50 percent from 
the field, while the oppo- 
nent shoots 60. Or the 
defense will force 20 
turnovers, while the 
offense gives up 30. The 
lone victory belongs to the 
women, as they dug in for 
an 18-point comeback to 
defeat Akron University 
55-54 on Dec. 2. 

A quick glance of the 
team's rosters would indi- 
cate lack of experience. Ten 
out of the 14 athletes on the 
women's roster are under- 
classmen, while eight out 
of 13 of the men are sopho- 
mores or freshmen.' 

Another glance of 
schedules would spark one 
simple word: ruthless. The 
men lost to Kent State, a 
perennial NCAA 

and Iowa State, an Elite 
Eight contestant in the same The 1 
tournament in 2000, is an Dec. 
upper echelon collegiate 
program. Games against Butler, 
Miami (Fl), IUPU1, Valparaiso, 
and Top 25 ranked Purdue still 
remain. The women have had no 
cakewalk either. Starting their 
season on the road in back-to-back 
games against Kentucky and 
Louisville is a daunting task for 
such a young team. Valparaiso, 
Wright State, and Wisconsin- 




nen's basketball team is off to an 0-6 start this season. On 
10, they shoot for their first victory 

Green Bay are challenging games iou-.lv waiting in the median with

a rough one, full of "Road Closed"

Take the "C" out of BCS 



Its so hard to 
say goodbye to 
my fans... 







By Nick West 
The Communicator 

Oh USC, I'm feeling s 
bly sorry for you. It's nc 
fault you are head and shoulders 
the best college football team in the 
country. It's not your fault all of 
the sports writers and coaches have 
you ranked #1 in both the 



fault thai 
thinks Oklahoma and LSU should 
play in the National Championship 
game instead of you. 

See, back in 1997 Michigan 
and Nebraska split the National 
Championship, even though 
Michigan's successful season was 
more impressive than Nebraska's. 

Commentary 

The next year, the Bowl 
Championship Series (BCS) was 
created to avoid such a controversy 
ever again. The computer system 
would put the top teams in the 
country against each other, based 
on strength of schedule, margin of 
victory, etc., etc., etc. and one 
National Champion would be 
crowned. 

Things haven't changed 
much. In three of the six seasons 
the system has been implemented, 
there has been controversy, howev- 
er; none worse than this season. 

This year, the coaches and 
sports writers voted USC #1, LSU 
#2, Oklahoma #3, and Michigan #4 
on December 7 after former #1 
Oklahoma lost and #2 USC and #3 
LSU handily won the day before. 
So it should be #1 versus #2 and #3 
versus #4 in the bowl games, right? 

Nope. At least not according 
to the BCS. 

The fatally flawed computer 
picked #1 USC and #4 Michigan in 



The system was created to disallow rematches from the regular 
season. So why in the hell is Florida State and Miami playing 
again? Oh weird, another flaw in the BCS.

Here are m\ 1 U'isnian and com- 
plete Bowl game picks.

is Larry Fitzgerald. Chris Perry from

round of the Iowa State Cyclone 
Challenge al Hilton Coliseum.' 

IPFW was able to keep Iowa 
State within hailing distance for most 
of the first half, using nine first half 
points from junior forward Ric 
Wyand 

But, the Dons failed to score 
over the last 2:24 of the first half, and 
a 5-0 ISU run made it 41-27 at half- 
Hoping to come out and close 
the gap, IPFW found itself on the 
wrong end of a 15-6 run in the first 
five minutes of the second half. Iowa

never looked back.

IPFW, trailing most of the first

The 'Dons would tied the game 
early in the second half at 40-all on a

But in a 10 minute stretch, 
UALR used seven unanswered
