piGrtionSy advertising: Facebdolc on fire 



By Said El-Dajar 

dddinOIOipfw.HJu 




Receiving mail 
was once a sincere and 
important matter. An 
elegant letter with the 
senders wax mark was 
delivered to your win- 
dows ill by 

carrier pigeon or ivizard's 
owl. Where after embrac- 
ing the message 10 
your bosom in recog- 
nition of the time and 
thought put into the 
message, a tear dribbles 
down your cheek in ad- 
miration that mail can 
travel so fast. ..now fast- 
er... Fast forward to 2007, 
Poke. Some random 
guy \vilh greasy hair and 
a passion for Halo and 
Pokemon confidently 
and telekineticaUy lets 
you know, "hey, let's su- 
per hug and play 
pirates and ninjas." 

Confused? 

According to 
comScore Media Metrix 
if you are under 25 years 
old, you have heard of 
Facebook, the super- 
hot place to be on the 
Net. You may have been 
lagged in a photo, ran- 
domly poked by some- 
one you least expect, or 
have an in depth wall - to 
- wall conversation that 
has the attention of all 



your friends. While noth- 
ing may seem new about 
this social net^vorking 
site, 

the reality is that there 
are businesses brewing 
and spe\\'ing out more 
than die average person 
can handle. With a new 
approach to community, 
here a look at what the 
projected 15 billion dol- 
lar company is doing to 
revolutionize Uiefuture 
of social networking and 
business. 

While many 

companies saw potential 
from the get go, it wasn't 
until October when Mi- 
crosoft invested 240 mil- 
lion dollars, a 1.6 percent 
slake in Facebook. While 
Facebook was already on 
the map, it was M^'Space 
who had tlie business 
spotlight. In a fune 2007 
issue of Home Business, 
Facebook wasn't even 
recognized as a strategj' 
for Internet businesses. 
According to the same ar- 
ticledeliberating whether 
MySpacc should be apart 
of your internet sirategj' 
for startups and home 
businesses, MySpace 
had increasingly become 
the jumping point into 
Internet marketing. 

While Myspace 
has been able to capture 
the world of the small and 
independent, through 
a rambunctious field 
of sound and YouTlibe 
clips, Facebook is allow- 
ing users to have fim and 
market themselves with- 
out even trying. 

According to The 
New York Times, Face- 
book now will give adver- 
tisers the ability to create 
their own profile pages 
on its system that will 
let users identify them- 
selves as fans of a prod- 
uct. Each user's news 
feed ivill contain items 
like "Bobby Smith is now 



a fan of Toyota 
Prius." 

Reportonbusi- 
ness.com reported that 
when a Facebook user 
makes a 

purchase, a message is 
sent to the news feeds of 
their friends, 
telling them what they 
bought. About 40 com- 
panies, including 
overstock.com and movie 
ticket retailers Fandango, 
have installed the 
free tool. 

Speculation has 
risen and groups on 
Facebook have already 
been 

formulated in rebellion, 
noting that shoi\ing 
members purchases is 
not only an invasion of 
privacy, but can ruin the 
surprise of gift giving. 
Facebook does on the 
other hand give notice to 
users and members 
before they add or post 
something. 

"Users also are 
given multiple ways to 
choose not to share in- 
formation 

from a participating site, 
both on that site and on 
Facebook," the 
company said in a state- 
ment. 

While the ethical 
concern for exposure is 
out there, according to 
comScore Media Me- 
trix, there are 33 mil- 
lion monthly users and 
counting on Facebook. 
While MySpace can boast 
72 miUion, Facebook has 
recently opened its "in- 
terwebJactic door" for 
everyone. What was once 
a place for only college 
students has become a 
"safe haven" for everyone 
and their grandmothers. 
comScore has reported 
that since May of 2006, 
the largest demographic 
to join and use Facebook 
has been 35 years and 



older. These networks 
are growing and not too 
many are concerned 
about the consequences 
of life on the Internet. 

With this shift, 
the Facebook team acted 
fast to ensure that every- 
one is satisfied and con- 
tent. How? 

How about han- 
dling around 7,000 free 
add-on applications 
where members can do 
everything from moni- 
tor tiieir stock porfolios 
to create and add digital 
bumper stickers to their 
profiles. Facebook allows 
programmers or anyone 
with the skills to develop 
their own applications 
through an organized 
and convenient interface 
that MySpace lacks. 

Thesiteishttp:// 
developer, facebook. 
com, and its a social 
netivork with in a social 
nenvork - sounds like a 
community. Developer is 



MySpace mthout an ego 
and narcissism, where 
members can keep up 
the groivth of Facebook 
andimplement new 

ways people can enjoy 
themselves and further 
become attached to the 
already addicting social 
networking lifestyle. 

The reason for 
sticking around would 
be the commitment and 
emotional 

attachment to these net- 
works. There has to be a 
constant novelty, or peo- 
ple will find something 
new. Sites like Friendster 
and Xanga ultimately 
lost popularity because 
there was nothing left 
to do there. They're like 
a highschool dance, " 
says Max Lecchin, CEO 
of Slide, a tope maker of 
image-based applica- 
tions for social networks. 
"Everyone shows up and 
nobdoy does anything, 
because there's nothing 



to do." 

Facebook now 
has 7,000 things to do, 
and it might be a while 
before you 

get bored. The latest 
trends and fads will be- 
come which applications 
are hottest and will fur- 
ther explore what people 
are looking to do on and 
off the web. 

Willie Facebook 
may seem like just an- 
other place to hangout, 
it is a slide under a mi- 
croscope the business 
world is studying closely. 
Observing us mice in our 
maze, feeding us cheese 
and cyber wine, the ways 
of accessing information 
is changing and so is the 
world of money making. 
Remember in Return of 
the Mummy when the 
bad guy shot down the 
falcon for relajing infor- 
mation to the good guys. 
Exactly.

Oil prices, trade deficit major culprits as U.S. money deteriorates in worth 



By JESSIE RUCKMAN

According to recent 
reports by Bloomberg 
Markets, the value of the 
U.S. dollar is declining 
in comparison \viih the 
Euro and the yen. 

While European and 
Chinese currencies have 
remained relatively 

steady in recent weeks, 
the Euro Is equivalent to 
S1.48 American. 

The value is declining 
due to rising oil prices 
and the trade deficit 
between the United 
States and foreign 
entities that produce 
cheaper goods, such as 
China and Japan. 

Oil prices have reached 
record highs, nearing 
SlOO per barrel of crude 
oil, which is a response 
to increasing demand 
and dwindling supply. 

"Think of all the HD- 
TVs that Americans 
are buying cheap from 
Japan, supplying more 



American dollars into 
the market," said IPFW 

economics professor 
John Kessler. 

The trade deficit 




may be an abstract 
concept that can 
be explained rather 
simply. According to 
Dr. Kessler, ultimately 
the value of the dollar 
comes from the imports 
and exports of goods 
and products. 

If something is 
imported into the 
United Slates, we are 
buying something from 
a foreign country so we 
have to exchange our 
money for theirs. In 



essence, companies who 
are exchanging goods for 
money are saying, '1 will 
give you a dollar for the 
equal yen amount.' 

By increasing the supply 
of American dollars into 
the market while the 
demand stays the same, 
the market becomes 
saturated. Once the 
marketbecomessaturated 
with American currency, 
the value declines. 

"If all we do is 
increase the supply of 
dollars and demand stays 
the same, then value 
of dollar goes down. 
Similarly when someone 
from China wants to 
purchase something 

from the U.S., they pay 
in American dollars, 
effecting the supply and 
demand," said Kessler. 

The problem with the 
weakening American 
dollar comes when there 
is more export than 
import, thus saturating 
ihe world market with 
that currency.

a lot of export-driven 
economies that are 
highly competitive, and 
with a large trade deficit. 
When that happens, 
the value of money 
drops and people hold 
onto their dollars," said 
professor Lawrence 
Haber, Ph.D. 

Meanwhile, investors 
are paying a higher 
price for gold, because 
it is seen as a sort 
of insurance policy 
against a slumping 
market. According 

to Pratima Desai 
{Reuters). "A falling U.S. 
currency makes dollar- 
denominated metals

other currencies, while

standards are a thing 
of the past, and now 
U.S. currency is backed 
by the good faith and 
credit of the American 
government. 

"The value of currency 
is based upon the health 
of our economy, and 
when it is perceived as 
a good value, people are 
willing to invest," said 
Haber. 

Gold has long been 
perceived as the standard 
of value, followed by 
silver. The American 
government had at one 



government backed 
dollars with gold -who 
are some of the world's 
greatest producers 

of gold? Russia and 
South Africa. The 

consequences of having 
those countries supply 
the U.S. market with 
gold could cause major 
inflation. 

"The dollar is weak 
and that means there 
is a general uplift for 
metals," said Dan Smith.

Music blog Stereogum celebrates 
Radiohead with cover tribute 



By Jeremy Buckley 

U-WIHE 



Music blogging has be- 
come a rather competi- 
tive industry within the 
realm of independent 
music. 

The most respected 
among them rise to the 
top of the heap in part 
by discussing the trends 
people care about, but 
also in creating original 
exclusive content that's 
not available elsewhere. 

In the lead up to this 
summer's media frenzy 
10 honor the -lOth anni- 
versary of the release of 
The Beatles' classic al- 
bum "Sgt. Peppers Lone- 
ly Hearts Club Band," the 
higher-ups at Stereogum. 
com realized it was also 
the 10th anniversary of 
an album that was in- 
credibly meaningful to 
its core audience. 

"It had been a decade 
since Radiohead gave us 
'OK Computer,' which 
seemed to sneak up on 
everybody," said Stc- 
reogum's associate edi- 



tor in chief, Amrit Singh. 
"We started brainstorm- 
ing ideas for celebrat- 
ing Badiohead's clas- 
sic, and at some point 
Scott (I^patine, founder 
and editor-in-chief of 
Stereogum) introduced 
the possibility of get- 
ting some of our favor- 
ite bands to cover songs 
from the record for a 
track-by-track cover trib- 
ute." 

The culmination of 
those brainstorming ses- 
sions became what looks 
to become a tradition 
with "Stereogum Pres- 
ents...' albums, the first 
being"0KX:A1Vibute to 
OK Computer." 

The 12-track album 
can be streamed at sle- 
reogum.com/okx and 
features a track- by- track 
reintcrpretation from 
some of today's leading 
indie-rockers including 
John Vanderslice, Cold 
War Kids and The IXvi- 
light Sad. 

Singh said the criteria 

for picking bands to be 

involved in the project 

was pretty simple. 

"The first and primary 



criterion is: we have to 
love the artist," he said. 
"In those initial stages 
we're just working with 
potentialities; once we've 
paired ariisis with songs, 
we allow bands the free- 
dom to pay tribute and 
record their cover as they 
see fit. We listen to the fi- 
nal product in the same 
way as our readers: just 
as curious, just as excit- 
ed." 

Brandon Soussy, a 
senior writer for Ste- 
reogum, wrote Ihe in- 
troductory essay for the 
compilation and noted, 
"We embrace the irony 
of releasing 'OKX' as a se- 
ries of MP3's sent to us by 
their makers via e-mail 
and enjoyed by you on a 
computer." 

For a brief period Ste- 
reogum was given per- 
mission to allow people 
to download the MP3's 
for "OKX" from the Web 
site, but now that it has 
run out of permanent li- 
censes, only streams are 
allowed.

Facebook co-founder 
backs Barack Obama 



By KASHAY SANDERS 



Describing the online 
ix-orid as tlie new venue for 
poliiica] campaigns, Face- 
lxM)k co-founder Chris 
Hu(^ics explained how he 
left tlie social -networking 
websile to work for Sen. 
Barack Obama, D-Ul., in a 
discussion with DanmouUi 
students in Rockefeller Cen- 
ter Wtednesday erening. 

The 23-year-old Harvard 
graduate began the sitewith 
his friends Mike Zuckeiberg 
and DiistinMoso3vitz while 
they ivEre sophomores in 
college They found them- 
selves discussing how diffi- 
cult it was to keep in touch 
with friends while in school, 
even ivith telephone calls 
and dinner dates. Hu^es 
said. 

Asa result, they creatGd an 
eaiiy version of Racebook 
for the Harvard community'. 
It included a profile, but 
tliere was no wall, messag- 
ing or applications of any 
kind. Even with this 'iDare- 
bones technologj'," Hu^es 
said, the company took 
off and became popular at 
Har.'ani 

"We soon saiv that iveheld 
the potential to change the 
iva&gt;' people were interact- 
ing," Hughes said. 

The co-founders soon 
extended their site to uni- 
versities, hi^ schools, busi- 
nesses and evennjally to 
anyone wth an e-mail ad- 
dress. Tlie site now boasts 
54 million users worldwide, 
receives 250.000 new users 
a day. has 60 billion page 




^tfM(UKl(Uau|&gt;_ 



views per mondi and is the 
number one photo shar- 
ing application on the web. 
according to the website's 
press page. Despite its targe 
si;^ Hughes said users are 
limited to interacting witli 
people witliin their own 
"networks," just like they 
would in real life. 

"It's a virtual community 
that mirrors one's real com- 
mtinity." Hughes said. 

Hu^es took a leave from 
the company in ftbruary. 
Originally interested in po- 
litical science, Huglies said 
he joined Obama's cam- 
paign because he found the 
polidcian to be "genuine." 

"Tlie more I learn about 
Barack, die more I am sure 
that he is a once-in-a-gen- 
eration candidate," Huglies 
said. 
Hufihes rallp d Ohamn's 



judgment "impeccable" 
and praised him for "hav- 
ing tiie strength and cour- 
age to say what he believes," 
specificallyindiecaseofthe 
war in Iraq. 

As a demonstration of the 
work he has done for the 
campaign. Hu^es took the 
audience on a tour of Face- 
books Obama-centric pag- 
es, urging audience mem- 
bers to join the One Million 
Strong for Barack Obama 
group. Hughes also show- 
cased the "Obama applica- 
tion," vjhidi displays all the 
latest news and videos on 
Obama and allows users to 
vote forwiietheror not they 
want the article to show on 
dieir profile. Hughes said 
tliat the Obama campaign 
recognizes the importance 
of peer-to-peer engage- 
mcnt, tvliich he said is more 



effective than direct mar- 
keting. 

Nationally, Hughes is the 
head of online organizing 
for tlic campaign, a posidon 
that allocs him to employ 
many of die same skills he 
used for Facebook, He said 
his positioii is based on en- 
abling supporters to take 
charge of tlie campaign in 
their mvn communities. 

It's not enou^, he assert- 
ed, to just have a website 
staling die position of the 
politician. The sites should 
allow people to see some- 
thing about Obama and be 
able to share it witli friends, 
Hughes said. 

Wlien asked if he would 
return to Facebook. Hu^es 
said, "Right now, I'm just 
lazer- focused on getting 
Barack in office."

releasing "OKX," Ste- 
reogum came back 
strong ivith its second 
album of interpretations 
with "Drive XV: A Trib- 
ute to Automatic for the 
People." The tribute to 
the classic R.E.M. record 
includes 12 cuts from 
artists like Rogue Wave, 
Blitzen TVapper, Meat 
Puppets and the Shout 
Out Louds. 

"We were encouraged 
by the response, too, and 
felt there were plenty 
more albums worthy of 
revisitation. reinterpre- 
tation, celebration. " 

The songs from that 
collection are still avail- 
able for download at 
sIereogum.com/drivexv 
and 10 bonus cuts that 
other bands contributed 
from the same album are 
also available to listen to. 
In his essay "Sweetness 
Followed: 15 Years after 
'Automatic,'" Fluxblog. 
com founder Matthew 
Perpetua pointed out the 
appreciation the e-in- 
terpretations had for the 
originals. 

"Whether the artists 
messed about with the 
songs or played them 
straight, every track on 
'Drive XV' is guided by a 
reverence for the source 
material, and for the as- 
tonishing craft of Bill 
Berr&gt;', Peter Buck, Mike 
Mills and Michael Stipe," 
Perpetua said. 

Because of the dming 
with the release of the 
tribute and R.E.M.'s in- 
tention of releasing a live 
album the same month, 
the Stereogum crew 
lucked into an amicable 
relationship with the 
band. 

"We were fortunate 



enough to work with 
R.E.M.'s camp to obtain a 
gratis hcense for a period 
of time," Singh said. "The 
band heard about our 
tribute, was 'really into 
it' - according to their 
longtime manager Bertis 
Downs - and we got to 
talk to Mike Mills." 

Singh said Stereogum 
has received offers to 
release the tributes as 
proper records but thus 
far his company has de- 
clined all offers of the 

"We're not interested 
in going that route; it's 
antithetical to the enter- 
prise," Singh said, "This 
is the product of a music 
blog that values the pow- 
er of digitally distributing 
carefully selected songs 
for Free. The 'Stereogum 
Presents...' projects are 
a reflection of that, and 
selling the record in a 
store would contradict 
it." 

The length of the pro- 
cess from the initial e- 
mails to b(inds to actu- 
ally releasing the MP3's 
on the Internet has taken 
between three and four 
months, Singh said, and 
the series is expected to 
continue in the coming 
years. 

"Looking for major an- 
niversaries would be 
too restrictive going for- 
ward," he said. "Our next 
tribute will be a classic 
album from the 1990s 
when our readership was 
coming of age - nostal- 
gia for alternative nation 
and aJI that, but not nec- 
essarily a special number 
of years to the day the al- 
bum was released."

Vfe all knoxv there's a writ- 
ers' strike going on. Within 
a few weeks, there will be 
no new episodes of just 
about any shows airing tin- 
til this thing gets lesolved, 
and major movies have 
been delayed. With indus- 
try insidere speculating 
tliat diat could be at least 
nine months fium now, 
M^iat are we to do? V\fe need 
to beenteriained. [propose 
a solution. 

I will whore myself out 
to the studios and become 



a scab writer, armed widi 
only my mediocre knowl- 
edge of film and television. 
With shows like "Termi- 
nator The Sarah Connor 
Chronicles" piuntiering 
soon and the "Sex and the 
City" movie headed for 
theaters next summer, I 
can only imagine the execs 
will like diis idea as much 
as I do. 
Here's what I have in store 
for television: 

"Legally Blonde: Jus- 
dee is Blonde": The series 
picks up after tlie second 
movie left off, wherever tlie 
hell lliat was, and would 
chronicle EUe Woods (Anna 
Paris, "Scary Movie") solv- 



ing tough "Lavv &amp; Oider"- 
style cases. But by using her 
unique skill set, she takes 
on cases other legal dra- 
mas can't, such as "Tlie prl 
who wore her friend's dress 
and then lied about it" (Gu- 
cci isn't supposed to look 
stretched like that) or "The 
tragedy of the fake hand- 
bag" (Prada double-stitch- 
es its purses, obvif). On The 
CW, Tliesday at 8/7 central. 
Dear God, I can actually see 
this happening. 
"Annageddon:The Scries": 
Wait, wait, stay with me. Ev- 
ery week it's up to A.J. Frost, 
Harry S. Stamper (he totally 
survived tlieexplosion) and 
tlie rest of dicir team to save 



the worid from impending 
doom. How manyivays can 
the worid end, exactly? Af- 
tertheyendclimatechange 
in the pilot, tlie rest of tlieir 
slrug^es include re igniting 
our dying sun, diffusing a 
nuclear war, ctiring a mas- 
sive bird-flu outbreak and 
finally enga^g in hand- 
to-hand combat with the 
Four Horsemen of the 
Apocalypse. The show \vill 
have a budget rouglily the 
size of Norway's GDP and 
will mvn the 18- to 36-year- 
old male audience. 

And coming soon to a 
dieater hopefully nowhere 
near you: 

"11 Film del Sopranos":

Monday in the UK with Hello- 
goodbye, Say Anything and Go 
Audio. Next spring they will be 
headlining their own tour, and 
you can bet that we'll be there 
to cover it. 

Sherwood started in 2002 when 
its four founding members were 
attending Cal Poly State Univer- 
sity. The band released their de- 



but LP, "Sing, But Keep Going" 
through Sidecho Records in 
2005. This sold over 20,000 cop- 
ies and Sherwood began getting 
noticed. They -■ — - ^^ 
played at the 
Warped Tour to 
sold-out shows 
and released 
their "Summer ' 

EP" through Ab- 
solutePunk.net, a free, down- 
loadable EP They went on to 
sign with MySpace Records - a 
choice that reflects the impor- 
tance that Sherwood places on 
continuing connecting with 



their fans. Their newest album, 
"A Different Light" debuted this 
year with 4,000 copies sold. 
Sherwood is a feel-good band, 
indie rock and indie pop, with 
thoughtful and catchy lyrics. 

Connecting with their audi- 
ence and fans is a focus for the 
band. "Fans are really impor- 
tant," Leibovitch said on Friday. 
"There's no exclusivity to our 
^^^^^^^^ music. All Sher- 
wood songs 
can be played 
on a guitar, sit- 
ting around a 
campfire." This 
accessibility is 
intrinsic to Sherwood, and may 
be one reason why the music 
translates so well to college stu- 
dents. 

The inspiration for such mu- 
sic is clear, "We're pretty normal 



"We're pretty normal 

college kids who love 

music and love making 

music." 



college kids who love music and 
love making music." 

Leibovitch reminisced that 
when writing their last album, 
'A Different Light," the band 
would spend a couple of hours 
a day simply listening to music 
together. In Sherwood's mu- 
sic there is a common thread 
between the music they lis- 
ten to and the music they play 
They would listen to music that 
spanned a lot of generations to 
figure out how to grow their own 
music into something greater. 
When asked about it, Leibo- 
vitch said, "You spend all your 
time entertaining and then go 
back to being vulnerable and 
honest and try to put out a re- 
cord that is indicative of where 
you are now. When you grow 
as a person, your music grows 
with you."

Sleep'ngiGiants 



1 2:1 4am Thursday, Nov 22 



As someone whose musical 
diet has consisted of nothing 
but Kate Nash, Interpol. De- 
vendra Banhart and Iron and 
Wine for the last few months; 
1 would never imagine myself 
at a concert making unbiased 
judgments about bands such 
as Cobra Starship, Sherwood, 
The Rocket Summer, Armor for 
Sleep and the Academy Is for a 
newspaper article. So I am going 
to paint a picture for you, a pic- 
ture from my brain to this very 
paper you are reading. 

Imagine yourself swimming 
in a white-capped ocean of 
"emo"-tainted estrogen. Teen- 
age girls swooning over the 
musicians from bands such as 
Cobra Starship, Sherwood, The 
Rocket Summer, Armor for Sleep 
and The Academy Is, as if they 
were all modern day Elvis'. The 



boys decked out in their pants 
deemed too humanly small to 
exist, trying not to appear even 
remotely excited. Suddenly 
the lights go down and you're 
trapped in a vortex of adoles- 
cent voices screaming and yell- 
ing in jubilation and sheer ex- 
citement. 

Cobra Starship took the stage 
first. The lead singer, Gabe Sa- 
porta, came strutting across 
the stage wearing jeans that are 
impossibly tight, a Me With- 
out You t-shirt, purple hooded 
sweatshirt and a piece of bling. 
The band ripped into tlieir set, 
which included a variety of high- 
lights. These included a cameo 
appearance by The Academy 
Is lead singer William Beckett, 
Gabe disappearing side stage 
and then returning to inform 
the crowd he "just threw up a

Nuts and Bolts: 

The Fort Wayne Philharmonic 

3:16pm Sunday, Nov 18 



Embassy Theatre, Saturday, 
Nov. 17 -The Fort Wayne Phil- 
harmonic showcased the artistry 
of Concertmaster Hiromi Ito and 
guest conductor Scott Yoo. Mu- 
sic for the evening was Cotton's 
Elegy, Britten's Violin Concerto 
No. 1 and Schumann's Sympho- 
ny No. 1 in B flat (spring). 

Ito performed the Britten 
concerto with great technique, 
sailing through difficult pas- 
sages of harmonic double stops, 
bombastic chords and arrhyth- 
mic melody. Prominent to the 
piece also were the piccolos and 
tuba, which added an interest- 
ing interlude. Yoo conducted the 



piece with great energy, bringing 
the chaos of sound into a me- 
lodic scale by the entire orches- 
tra near the end of the piece. 

Premiered in 1940, this piece 
was viTitten by Britten for violin- 
ist Antonio Brosa. Devised in 
direct opposition to the stan- 
dard form of a concerto, which 
has three different movements, 
one slow sandwiched between 
two fast movements, this work 
has two slow movements and 
one fast. 

A complete contrast in style 
and harmony was provided by 
Schumann's symphony after the 
intermission. Opening with a 



brassy fanfare, the first move- 
ment contained fantastic arpeg- 
giating chords that perfectly 
reflected Schumann's epithet to 
the movement, 'Spring's Awak- 
ening'. Conductor Yoo snatched 
at pieces of the music, stirring 
the orchestra together in one 
grand symphony of sound. 
The second movement (Eve- 
ning) was gradual, with twilight 
harmony and gende sounds 
among the strings. The quiet 
ending was exploded by a roil- 
ing, pulsing third movement. 
The 'Merry Playmates' closed 
a romp through the instru- 
ments and slid into a waltz 
tempo, strings gliding through 
while the timpani rolled beats. 
The fourth movement, (Spring 
Replete) boiled up at the begin- 
ning only to pause at a great 
fermata. Then the melody 
danced through, picking up a 



"Nutcracker" playfulness as the 
woodwinds flew above a string 
pizzicato line. Closing with a 
tremendous crescendo, the 
symphony ended on emphatic 
chords. 

It is interesting to note that 
Schumann later removed the 
individual movement titles 
to this symphony so as to al- 
low the audience to create 
their own interpretation of the 
music. For a man who feared 
insanity and eventually died 
in an asylum, this piece was a 
brilliant work of sense, reflect- 
ing beautiful harmony and 
elegant composition. According 
to Clara Schumann, the com- 
poser's wife, this symphony was 
inspired byAdolph Bottger's 
poem "Spring blossoms forth 
in the valley". It was first con- 
ducted by Felix Mendelssohn in 
March of 1841.

description 



Finals are two Wffks away. Siiidynia! Bl-ct pong? Ves. Kegs? Indeed. 
As much keg beer as an ove[ 21-year old can drinfc, until diey're lapped. Six 
dollar cover charge ai a hotel where, should you decide to stay, (he cost is 
only $45, But universitj' organizations don't sponsor such end -of -semester 
bashes like Fall into Finals, do ihey? 

According to senior Brad Bagan, they do now! President of the Student 
Alumni Association, Bagan joined up with Piere's and the Quality Inn Hotel to 
throwan end of semester bash for all students, both under 21 and over. 

"The whole point of this party is to have hin and relax before finals, and 
do it as safely as possible. That's why Piere's is supplying vans to and from the 
hotel, slopping by Flashbacks and back to Piere's." 

Piere's is not just a sponsor of this party, but a partner as well. Special 
Events Coordinator for Piere's, Amy Markancheck, sees a partnership between 
the bar and the university as nothing but a good decision. 

"Who drinks at bars? College students. IPFWstudenisdon't have any par- 
ty areas like sororities or fraternities, and Piere's can offer students a safe place 
to have fun and host events. Keep in mind that Piere's is the largest bar in the 
Midwest with the fourth most ticket sales in the world, so it's guaranteed to be 
a fun time." 

Markancheck added that Piere's had wanted to team up with IPFW because 
so many of the students are repeat customers of their bar. Piere's wanted to 
support student life at IPFW. 

According to Bagan, Fall into Finals will be an all-inclusive bash where ev- 
ery student is welcome to come and party with friends, and perhaps make 
some new ones as well. 

"We are going to have a 32-team NCAA-style beer pong with brackets. The 
cost is $3 pet person or S6 per team, and we are giving away tickets to the Papa 
Roach show on Dec. 15, " said Bagan. 

Fall into Finals will feature two bands - Freezing Scene and The North River 
Agents. Tickets were provided by Piere's. But how did this all come together? 

The Student Alumni Association, headed up by Bagan, found a loophole 
that lakes care of the liability. 

"We sat down with David Reynolds [Business Manager of Student Activi- 
ties/Organizations), took liability away from the school and the student orga- 
nization by having the party at a third party vendor." 

That vendor. The Quality Inn, will supply the party with bartenders and 
make sure that cabs are called when needed. There will also be privately-run 
security, which will be checking IDs at the door and making sure that every- 
one falls safely into iinals. 

'The West Lafayette campus has this type of event regularly, so we are fol- 
lowing in their footsteps. I fully expect the club to carry off a successful and 
safe event. There is a distinction between having an on-versus-off campus 
event. An on campus event would have many more restrictions," said Reyn- 
olds. 

But the fun doesn't slop after this bash, which lakes place on Nov. 30. Un- 
like Fall into Finals, however, future parties will take place at Picasso's, a part 
of Piere's party complex.

IPFW women's bas- 
ketball opened up their 
home schedule with Mi- 
ami (OH) and in over- 
lime clipped the Red- 
Hawks. 79-74 in the first 
meeting of the pair. The 
Mastodons finished with 
three ladies in double- 
digit points. 

IPFW opened up the 
game with a good lay-up 
by Samantha Edwards, 
but the BedHawks tied 
it up soon after with two 
good free throivs. Miami 
(OH) would score the 
next four points to take 
an early four point lead. 



but IPFW rallied back to 
tie it up at sLx and a made 
free throw by Natalie 
Roberts would put IPFW 
ahead by one, 7-6. 

The teams would trade a 
few points back and forth 
and then the Redl-lawks 
had another nin. taking 
a six point lead at 11:39, 
9-15. IPFW would start to 
cut away at the lead, cut- 
ting it to one widi 7:53 left 
in the first. 

The RedHawks contin- 
ued to take short leads, 
and held a six point lead 
with 2:35 left in the half, 
26-32. The Mastodons 
would cut it to three on a 
good jumper by Edwards 
and Chelsey Jackson 
would tie the game up at 



half on a good free throw 
and jumper, 34-34. 

"I thought we came out 
and played with alol of 
enthusiasm," said Chris 
Paul on the first half " We 
had trouble shooting, but 
we defended well. One 
thing we've been working 
hard in practice on is re- 
bounding and after losing 
Lieseloi at the beginning 
of the season and lulie for 
this game our rebound- 
ing came through. I felt 
[hat was the diference in 
the first half But overall I 
was pleased with our ef- 
forts." 

The RedHawks would 
Stan the second half with 
a good three -pointer to 
give them an early lead,

struggled in the first half 



but found her rhythm in 
the second. Natalie Rob- 
erts played the best game 
I've ever seen her play 
with the boards and her 
offensive scoring. 

"Sarah Haluska came 
off the bench and played 
and guarded well. Jordan 
Zuppe another freshman, 
also stepped up and made 
big shots. Samantha Ed-

the next five to take the 
game, 79-74. 

"The turning point for 
us was making big shots 
and the turnovers. I was 
very comfortable going 



into overtime and felt we 
had a good team effort 
and was very proud of 
how we played." 

The Mastodons were 
led by Lewis -Carlisle with

You can wear these 
around your hips or 
waist. Who can resist 
something so vers idle 
and in such fun colors? 



Really perfects your 

flaws and shows off your 

figure. The details really 

dress it up. 




This shirt is so versatile. 
Being black and white, it 
matches almost any- 
thing and can be worn 
no matter what your 
style.

Hey everyone! My name is Hope Lauster and I am a fresh- 
man at IPFW and the new fashion columnist for The Communica- 
tor. As a fashion design and merchandising major, I am definitely 
the guru you want to consult with for all your fashion mishaps. 
I have studied many aspects of fashion and can help you look 
slimmer, 
taller, curvier -you name it -I can help. 
Fashion has been a long time passion of mine and I have 
even designed many of my own pieces. So, when I was asked 
to start this column I jumped on the idea. I plan to teach you 
fun fashion tidbits, how to correctly build an outfit, and how to 
achieve a runway look on a budget. With the ever-changing fash- 
ion industry you can never know too much about it. And when 
you get down to it, fashion is something you wear every day. So, 
what's the reason not to be fashionable? 




The subtle style in a bold 

color can really make a 

statement. 




Metal studs are the 
newest trend. Cany this 
clutch out at night to 
add some silvery shine 
in the darkness, or throw 
it in your day time tote 
so you don't have to dig 
for odds and ends.

Cute with a little wicked 

side, these flats have a 

subtle edge. 




Comfortable and warm, 

these can be dressed up 

ordoivn.
