Student President Amanda McCann 
vetoed Ihe proposal because it was not 
in accordance with the constitution of 
Ihe Equestrian Club. Article III Section 
111: Financial Obligations of the Eques- 
trian Club constitution states "Should 
the club's budget be insufticieni io cov- 
er travel to and from competition, and 
lodging at the competition meets, then 
individual members will be responsi- 
ble for those obligations." 

In McCann's statement, she also 
stated that "IPSGA has been hesitant 
to charter an organization which could 
potentially be such a large recipient of 
funding while only catering to a spe- 
cialized group of students." McCann 
then went on to suggest that the of- 
fice of the Equestrian Club work with 



the Athletics Department to become a nel quoted Section 11, paragraph C of 



recognized sport at IPFW. In doing so. 
the club could receive financial and ad

on to warn Sen- 
ate that by "de- 
nying them the 
right to be eligi- 
ble to receive Senate TVavel funding is a 
clear violation of our own internal poU- 
cies, which trump the rules and poli-

perceived as an obscure, arguably Fu- 
tile, organization in which elected po- 
sitions were popularity contests and 
were sought after to pad one's resume 
and to promise "change" on campus 
and in student life, whatever that may 
be. Although there is already evidence 
of conflict between these elected posi- 
tions, this conflict may be healthy and 
illustrate that this year's administration 
will have a unique relationship, and 
thai proposals and rulings will be given 
more than one superficial glance this 
time around. 



Student coalition aims to save, develop IPFW Arabic program 



By Peter Schnellenberger 

ichnplDIOtludcnU.lplwcdu 



For die Fall 2009 semester, 
IPFW students had the oppor- 
tunity to enroll in an intro Ara- 
bic class. If you're interested in 
taking the class next semester, 
sorry, you're out of luck. 

The class's future does not 
sit well with some of the stu- 
dents who are enrolled in it 
now. The concerned students 
have banded together and set 
out on a mission to save the 
Arabic program so that the 



class v/ill be available to fiituie 
students. The group's ultimate 
goal is to start an undergradu- 
ate program at IPFW. 

This coalition has already 
started a Facebook group 
dedicated to saving the Ara- 
bic classes called, "Save IPFW 
Arabic!" Although they are not 
directly related, there are also 
plans for a student organiza- 
tion to be founded for students 
interested in Arabic culture. 

"I want to take action..." 
said Lauren Hughey, an IPFW 
Women's Studies major and 
"Save IPFW Arabic!' 



"considering the current 
events of the world it is inex- 
cusable for us not to [offer a 
BA. in Arabic|." Hughey wants 
to double major in Arabic and 
is ready to do whatever it takes 
to make the dream of starting 
a BA in Arabic at IPITV pos- 
sible. 

Cynthia Brandenburg Har- 
low, Arabic professor, said she 
is deeply impressed by the 
initiative that her students are 
taking. "I love my students. 
They are all capable of going 
as far as they want with Arabic 
Studies," said Harlow. 



Harlow is very commit- 
ted to her students and she 
makes herself available to her 
students if they are having dif- 
ficuldes. 

Harlow said she has recent- 
ly been assured that students 
currendy enrolled in the Ara- 
bic courses are guaranteed two 
full years of Arabic. These two 
years are enough to fulHli the 
College of Arts and Sciences 
foreign language requirement 
for an undergraduate degree. 

If you are interested in sup- 
porting "Save IPFW Arabic!" 
you will have an opportunity 



lo sign a petition to save the 
program, which wilt then be 
put forward to Student Sen- 
ate in hopes of it reaching the 
Chancellor. 

"Student Senate has the 
power to pass resolutions. A 
resotudon can be directed at 
specific persons and entities, 
calling for specific action." 
said Amanda McCann. Stu- 
dent Body President. The abil- 
ity to pass such a resolution 
might just be what "Save IPFW 
Arabic!" needs to achieve their

In the days following Sept. 11, 
Americans heard myriad inspirational 
speeches, promising victory over Al 
Qaeda, rebuilding at home, and never- 
ending respect and reverence for the 
fallen heroes and victims of the day. 
Eight years later, those speeches ring 
hollow. We are losing the war.

constructive, ambition. The National 
Sepi. II Memorial and Museum prob- 
ably will not be finished in time for the 
lOlh anniversary, as originally project- 
ed. The beautiful new subway station 
is nowhere in sight. Of all the lowers 
ringing ihc complex, only one has been 
lompleied; some have not even broken 
ground. 

The centerpiece of the rebuilding 
effort. One World Trade Center, stands 
barely more than 100 feel above street 
level, a hollow frame whose biggest 
progress to date has been its name 
change, from The Freedom Tower to 
a street address. The Port Authority of 
New York and New lersey tells us lo 
expect its completion in 2013, but It's 
tough to take them seriously when one 
realizes that there is still more than 
1.600 feel to go. three years after con- 
struction got under way. 

Hell, it has been eight years and 
the Deutsche Bank Building, mortally 
damaged in the attacks, still stands tail 
across the street, its deconstruction 
and demolition a slow, bachvard pro- 
cess that has already cost lives. There 
is talk that the entire site might not be 
completed by the end of Ihe next de- 
cade, and rumors abound that the proj- 
ect might not be completed because of 
cost. The country seems to have lost 
interest in the rebuilding effort. 

A similar story is unfolding In Af- 
ghanistan, where NATO's military 
operations are now opposed by most 
Americans. Increasingly, I read, see, 
and hear that Afghanistan is the next 
Vietnam; that it's immoral, that it's an 
exercise in empire building, or that it 
isn't worth the effort. 

I am no war hawk or conservative; 
I marched against the invasion of Iraq 
as a high school freshman and again to 
protest our occupation of that nation 
in 2005. I once squeezed in a protest 
march at the 2004 Republican Con- 
vention before rushing back home for 
football practice. But when faced with 
the increasing doubt and criticism sur- 
rounding our efforts in Afghanistan. I 
am flabbergasted. 



The similarities with Vietnam arc 
certainly worth noting; our enemy has 
safe haven in a country we cannot fol- 
low them into, the government we sup- 
port is corrupt and unethical, many 
years and deaths have yielded little 
progress, and we are faced with the 
ovenvhelming challenge of building a 
nation among an illilerale population. 
Far too many people have died while 
the powers that be have decided ihe 
appropriate tactics to lake. 

But Ai Qaeda and Ihe Taliban are 
not the Viet Cong or the North Viet- 
namese. The fact is that Ho Chi Mlnh 
never attacked New York City. Ho Chi 
Minh never released videos in which 
he laughed with glee over the deaths 
of American civilians. The South Viet- 
namese government so rivaled its 
Communist enemies fn brutality and 
oppression that it was difficult to justify 
the deaths of hundreds of thousands of 
people to keep it in power. In Afgliani- 
Stan, though, wiih memories ofTaliban 
atrocities still fresh, a recent BBC poll 
found that 90 percent of the population 
is opposed to its return to power, even 
after years of occupation and ineffec- 
tive government. 

These are nol mi.sguided ideologues 
wilh promises of social reform that we 
are fighting. These are men (and they 
are almost all men) who stage public 
executions in soccer stadiums, who 
assassinate little boys on their way to 
school and who do the same or worse 
to aspiring schoolgirls, who behead 
kidnapped journalists and aid work- 
ers on videotape for the world lo see. 
These are evil men who prey on fear 
and ignorance among an ill-protected 
and uneducated population. 

Sept. 11 is now an official national 
holiday called Patriot Day. We should 
be ashamed to call it thai. This coun- 
try's patriots twice withstood the brunt 
of the British Empire and later defeated 
Ihe Axis Powers in less than four years. 
This country's workers built the Em- 
pire Slate Building in just 410 days in 
Ihe midst of the Great Depression. Dare 
we besmirch ihose true patriots? Do we 
really care to dishonor the memory of 
the Sept. 1 1 dead wilh a catchy holiday 
name and ever- dwindling memorial 
ceremonies and slogans of 'Never For- 
get' while Ground Zero looks mostly 
the same as it did seven years ago and 
we stand ready to surrender Afghani- 
stan back to Al Qaeda and iheTaliban? 

I don't pretend to know the key to 
victory. I do know that it takes actual 
sacrifice, of not just blood but of lots 
and lots of time and money. This coun- 
try is now seriously debating whether 
victory is worth all of ihat. For shame.

If you drive to school, chances 
are you have experienced diffi- 
culty finding a parking space and 
traffic jams. A possible remedy 
for such inconveniences is using 
the Citilink or CampusLink bus 
systems. 

Citilink sharply reduced bus 
fare from forty-five dollars to nine 
dollars for students vrith a valid ID. 
Despite this discount, there have 
been a litde over 100 of these pass- 
es purchased since enacted in July. 

A recent survey taken 51 ran- 
dom members of the student 
population showed that all those 
surveyed were aware Fort Wayne 
had bus service, but only three had 
used CitiLink or (ZampusUnk in 
their life. Forty of those surveyed 
said they drove their own vehicle 
alone to school, and 38 students 
said they believed there was not 
enough parking at IPFW. When 
asked why they did not use public 
transporiadon, several students 
polled expressed concerns with 
insufficient routes, as well as mat- 
ters of convenience and reliability. 

Utilizing public transportation 
does require some pre-ride plan- 
ning. First, obtain a bus sched- 
ule. Route maps and dmes can be 
found online at wivw.fwcitiiink. 
com or at the Bursar's office. You 
will first need to determine your 
point of departure. If you have 
trouble finding a convenient ac- 
cess point, customer service rep- 
resentatives are on hand at 260 
"132-4546 if you need assistance. 

The most imporiant thing to 
keep in mind is that you will not 
be an expert bus rider right away. 
Yes, your first venture out may 



feel a bit awkivard. but do not be 
a&amp;^d to speak mlh your driver 
if you are not fully confident in 
navigatingyourdestination. Most 
importandy, lest your route before 
riding anywhere that ivill require 
time constraints. 

When you board the bus. insen 
or swipe your pass in the farebox. 
You can also pay with the exact 
change. S1.25, or purchase an 
All Day Pass for S3.00 by alerting 
the driver before you begin your 
transaction. Find a seat, keeping 
in mind immediate seating at the 
front is reserved for the elderly and 
disabled. There is also the likeL- 
hood of other riders attempting 
to make awkward small-talk ivith 
you. Ifyou feel uncomfortable, re- 
posidon yourself or move lo a seat 
in proximity to the driver. When 
you need to disembark, pull the 
stop-cord signaling to the driver to 
puU over. 

The biggest concern expressed 



by most riders is instances of buses 
running behind schedule. . Most 
drivers try to maintain sched- 
uled slops, but there is a chance 
your bus may run grossly behind 
schedule. Because stops are made 
only once on the hour, your best 
bet may be to find another mode 
of tiansporiadon. Conversely, If 
the route is severely behind, this 
may lend to the dilemma of busses 
showing up earlier to some slops 
than anticipated, also causing you 
to miss the bus. 

Bus service is unavailable after 
9:45pm on weekdays, past 6:30pm 
on Saturdays and inoperable on 
Sundays. 

With experience, patience and 
planning your use of Fort Wayne's 
Public Transportation Citilink can 
be a beneficial experience as it is 
cost effective, saves time and has- 
sle when trying to find a parking 
spot, and is environmentally re- 
sponsible.

Texting 



By Devin &amp; Hana 



Do other people, especially guys, 
read into text messages as much as I 
do? 

XX: Girls will read into a message 
what they would like to hear most. If 
a guy sends a message that says "Hey, 
I had a good lime, we should do that 
again," he probably just means what it 
says. To a girl who likes this guy, what 
she probably read was "Hey, I had the 
best time of my life with you and we 
should do it ever)' day, as a couple." 
Guys tend to say what they mean, get 
straight to the point. Girls like to test 
the waters and dirow hints around 
like leaves in autumn. Ladies, just say 
what you mean. If someone does not 
like what you say, so be it. What is this 
world without confrontations and in- 
dividuality? If you say what is on your 
mind and get turned out, who cares, 
you have about ninety more chances 
in a day. Saying what you mean to say 
makes you a mature person who knows 
what is going on and knows what they 
want. Also, pick up the phone once in a 
while and actually call the person you 
want to talk to; it is a lot more personal. 

XY: I would say most guys do not: 



it is just a text message. If they need to 
say something important to you, they 
will make sure you get what they are 
saying. I never understood why people 
say guys are confusing when most of 
us really are not. The majority of the 
time, I believe the girl is just trying lo 
find something that is not really there. 
As if they are not satisfied with what 
they got, so they want to twist things 
around and try to get themselves to 
see something more, when they need 
to realize that there is nothing more 
lo it. Whatever a guy wants lo tell you, 
if it is important, you will know. Until 
then, stop stressing yourself out over 
nothing. This does not mean you are a 
freak though. Many people over ana- 
lyze things because they truly want to 
get things right, and handle a situation 
as best as possible, but if you stare at a 
ham sandwich long enough, it will not 
turn into a steak. That is just fact. So if 
you are waiting for that big, "I like you a 
lot, and 1 want to see you tonight," and 
all you get is a, "want to hang later?" 
you need to realize that there is prob- 
ably not more to it than that. That does 
not mean give up. That just means you 
should not sweat the small stuff.

Music, in one word 

Bassist Victor Wooten graces 
Fort Wayne witti bass clinic 



By Lucas Carter 

luui,un&gt;t4&gt;hDlw|rdp'iyegnull to 



If you're a musician 
(especially a bassisl). 
chances are you've at 
least heard the nameVic- 
lor Woolen. 

Or maybe Bfla Fleck 
and the FIccklones? Or 
maybe you've seen him 
perform with friends in 
the Dave Matthews Band. 

Woolen is regarded as 
one of the best bassists 
of all time, past or pres- 
ent. His albums Soul Cir- 
cus and A Show of Hands 
have been a must listen 
for any music fanatic. 
Sweetwater Sound paired 
up with Hartke Amplifi- 
ers brought Victor to their 
campus for the night to 
perform and answer fan 
questions. 

The event was much 
more than just a guy and 
a drummer showing off 
their skills on a stage. 
Victor was more than 
eager to answer any and 



all questions thrown his 
way, and would not only 
answer, but manage to 
seemingly inspire every 
last person in the room to 
make music a bigger pan 
of their lives. 

"I've been asking 
people from all over the 
world over the last seven 
years to define the word 
"music" in one word." 
Wooten asked near the 
end of the night. Vari- 
ous audience members 
shouted out words like 
"love", "healing", "univer- 
sal", and so on. "It's inter- 
esting, no matter where 
I am I get that same re- 
sponse. The words I don't 
gel are words like notes, 
scales, guitar, bass.... if we 
aren't thinking of those 
words when we think 
about music, why should 
it be in our mind if we're 
playing music?" Wooten 
went on to say. 

"It was something 
completely different ' 
said IPFW finance major 
Natalie Shappell who was 
in attendance. 

He had a knack for re- 



vealing a side of music to 
the crowd that many had 
never thought of before, 
like the importance of 
how music should feel, 
rather than sound. 

Woolen would not 
only share his views on 
music, but would also 
play many fan favorites 
including "U Can't Hold 
No Groove" and his fan 
favorite bass rendition 
of "Amazing Grace". Even 
despite being familiar 
with the song he would 
be performing. Woolen 
always managed to ihroiv 
musical curveballs right 
when you were least ex- 
pecting it. Wooten was 
accompanied by well 
knovvn drummer J.D. 
Blair.

Peter Lupkin, Artist at Large 




By Andrew Gibson 

gi bi^DJOi lud(nts.)pfiv.edu 



Towering stain glass, 
images of St. Mary, Jesus, 
and other popular Chris- 
tian figures line the walls, 
with booming reverb 
bouncing off those walls 
and bits of dust and sand 
floating freely through 
the air. Was 1 in a mag- 
nificent cathedral? Not 
exactly. That is vrtiat I was 
greeted by when I walked 
through the threshold of 
the William L Lupkin De- 
signs studio, those things 
and of course artist Peter 
Lupkin. After introduc- 
tions and pleasantries 
were exchanged, I was 
given a tour of the space 
Peter primarily uses to 
create his arttvork. The 
downstairs held most of 
the pieces that were done 
by and for the studio, but 
the upstairs was a com- 
pletely different scene. 

Peter's personal works 
were on display and each 
was definitely eye catch- 
ing. There were oil paint- 
ings (Peter's favorite 
medium), charcoal paint- 
ings and of course glass 
pieces. At first ^ance one 
might assume thai Peter 
is a quiet, keep to him- 
self kind of guy. but get- 



ting to know him will re- 
ally turn that assumption 
around and on its head. 
He is chock fiill of ideas, 
opinions and beliefs 
about what an is and how 
it should be portrayed. 
Coming from humble 
beginnings, some of his 
first works included com- 
mentaries on violence 
over in Iraq and during 
the holiday seasons. Talk- 
ing about a still life he did 
early on, Peter told me, "I 
used a boxing glove, an 
alcohol bottle, and land 
of like a skewed Christ- 
mas ornament to try and 
show the holiday seasons, 
alcohol and violence and 
all that mixed together." 

One piece he had 
done in charcoal stood 
out quite well, it was one 
depicting a scene from 
the Book of Judith. The 
Book of fudith is pari of 
the bible and il contains 
the story of ludith who 
becomes involved with a 
General, Holofemes, of 
her Jewish people's en- 
emy. She double crosses 
him in order to conduct 
an assassination. It fea- 
tures Judith sitting next to 
the lifeless and headless 
body of Holofemes and 
he uiles it "The Contem- 
plation of fudith." 

"It rthe Book of lu- 
dith"! is a fairly well 



known story... itisaslon' 
a lot of other artists have 



that heroic action 
yeah it is a heroic stor&gt;' 
out there are all these 
complexes. I mean, even 
if you do something for 
the greater good, 1 think 
that WHS supposed to be 
the moral of il, but is she 
really a sinner or is she a 
saint? Yeah she saved her 
people but she also slepi 
with this guy and mur- 
dered him, said Peter. 

"The Contemplation 
of Judith" was actually 
sold to a private collec- 
tor for an undisclosed 
amount. Peter evennially 
wants to take over his fa- i 
tiler's studio and keep do- 
ing the work that they do 
there and hopefully ex- , 
pand upon it even more I 
and make it more sul- 1 
cessful. 

Does Peter have a fa- 
vorite artist? Yes he does. ! 
William Morris, an artisl i 
and designer in the lale 
19'" century." He admires 
Morris not just because of 
his body of work but also 
because he treated his 
workers under him fairly. 
Pclcr has a lot going for 
him and definitely has 
the talent to strike out on 
his own eveniually and ii , 
is safe to say he will no' 
be the starving artist type

It is understandable 



why Frank Turner is mak- 
ing wakes in the United 
States the way that he is. 
Large in Europe, Turner is 
still somewhat of an un- 
known here in the states 
but Poetry of the Deed 
shows potential to turn 
that around entirely. 

Generally an acous- 
tic anist. Poelr)- seems to 
draw from a more electric 
vein. Not overpowering. 
but slighdy different than 
previous releases none-

the aJb"atn-i5 aprimefljc-' 
ample of this, allowing for 
electric guitar to make its 
presence known without 
drowning out the sug- 
ary sweemess of TumePs 
voice. 

Stand out tracks 
would include "Try This 
At Home" and "Isabel," 
which proves that one 
can fall in love over and 



over again with this vocal- 
ist. 'l\irner is one of diose 
rarities in which you can 
actually tell he has an ac- 
cent when he sings which 
adds for a very unique feel 
to this music. He pours 
his heart out, yes, but as 
his voice envelopes the 
listener one cannot feel 
anything but bliss for the 
treat their ears are endur- 
ing. 

The first nine tracks of 
the album are very strong, 
howeverit is possibly that 
the listener could become 
slightly bored by track 
ten or eleven. When the 
closing track "Journey of

BANDS PERFORMING DOUBLE HEADER 

Both shows at Harrison House and Brass Rail cost $5 






By Robin Crowell

On September 25'" Heart Shaped Haie, Kantis. 
The Zebras, and others will be performing nvo seis 
of shows in one evening. Beginning at five pm the 
above three bands are performing at the Harrison 
llfjuse located at 1624 N. Harrison Street. At 10 pm 
rh(.' bands ivill be featured at The Brass Rail located at 
I !_'! Broadivayin downtown Fort Wayne. Both shows 
ro',1 five dollars, however pending attendance at the 
liiirrison House show, admission for the Brass Rail 
show will only be two dollars with proof of attending 
(he Harrison House show. 

Check out reviews for these three bands' latest 
:ilbiims. which you will also be able to pick up day of 



as it is bluntly documented in the song "Decapitated 
in Barbies Dreamhouse." The lyrics state "thousands 
of plastic role models/ an anorexic army turning teens 
lo trash piles," blatantly marring the role models and 
examples set for young people today. 

Though the album is only a six track EP, each track 
packs more punch than a lot of LPs are capable of in 
eleven or tivelve tracks. The album seems to travel 
faster than sound and just as one really begins getting 
into the music and understanding what the band is all 
about, it is over before it really began. Check it out, be 
prepared for great things from this band. 



like White Dancctastic ' make the nonsensical vocal 
st&gt;'ling not even matter because the music is just so 
much fun that what they are saving becomes instantly 
irrelevant. 

As above said, listening to this album on u casual 
basis probably isn't the best way to experience Knntis. 
however the live show is sure to hold entertaining sur- 
prises and an energetic atmosphere.

Rating: 2.5/5

pii'Ci,', all female, flectrunica ouiht sliuiild liave: biting 
IvrlLs, catchy, chanting vocals, and a reason lo dance. 
\-. far as instrumentaJs go, only aggressive percussion

The band is in every way bitter, angry, and cyni- 
t;tl loward the trials and tribulations of adolescence 



This band is not easy on the cars, huufvTr il there 
was any way to put humor to musii. , K.intjs would he 
it. Its'listenability' islow, however huinediingsLreaios 
epic live show' when listening to this album. 

The lyrics are hard to make out althou^ it is ap- 
parent that most of the 'words' are meaningless jin- 
berish anyivay. Kantis, unlike many metal bands, has 
a more tolerable sound than the likes of say... Panlera 
or Lamb oFGod [unless you're into that kind of thing). 
It is really hard to actually classify this band as a met- 
al band, but honestly that is the first genre that even 
comes close when attempting to judge this album. 

Stand-out tracks include the menacing 'One, 
l\vo, Three, Four' and 'Go Home,' a track poking fun 
at another local musician, Poopdeflex. Also, tracks

Sounds Like: Saddle Creek's band Beep 

Beep without the Conor Obersi influence. 
Rating: 3/5 



I iir some reason this band has everything 'in- 
liusiriiil about them, however they do not sound like 
an industrial band. They do well working with the 
synth and have an interesting way of complimenting 
the music with the vocals. 

There is nothing overpowering about the music 
itself, and it does well with aggressive crescendos re- 
lenting back to jumpy vocals. Also, for a three piece 
outfit, they have a remarkably layered sound not of- 
ten found in three piece situations. It is apparent that 
each individual in the band knows their instruments 
well, and this seven-track EP does well do exhibit this. 

Rumor has it that The Zebras put on a very lively 
performance, actively engaging the audience and 
playing the music fast and aggressively. 



Roommate's Pick: C/rca Survive 



Although this isn't a 
new band, i just discov- 
ered it in the past cou- 
ple weeks and thought I 
would give it a shot. Wlien 
! asked my friend about 
it 1 couldnt help but call 
it Cirque du Soleil, be- 
cause I could not for the 
life of me remember the 
name of the band, how- 
ever don'i get too excited: 



they don't perform circus 
ans or street entertain- 
ment. The genre of the 
group is sort of an experi- 
mental and progressive 
rock sound, and the lead 
singer's voice, Anthony 
Green, puts the music in 
its own niche of music. 
Some may recognize his 
voice as the former lead 
in Saosin and co-singer 
for The Sound of Animals 
Fighting, as well as his in- 
dependent work. 




Most of the songs are 
pretty laid back and easy 
to listen to whenever 
you put music on in the 
background. My room- 
mate had this placing a 
get-together for some of 
our friends and played it 
in the background, which 
is an alternate to blast- 
ing hip hop and rap that 
make no sense. 

I think that what I Uke 
most about this band are 
their track tides. "Hand- 
shakes at Sunrise," "The 
Glorious Nosebleed" and 
"The Great Golden Baby" 
are a few of my favorite 
ttack names froni^^eir 
discography. 

The band can be com- 
pared to the voices of 
Dashboard Confessional 
and the sounds of a less- 
cliche rock band. Scan- 
ning through two of their 

full length albums. On being anywhere close to thoughldonot find them at your next get together. 
Letting Co and /utuma. horrible or off-putting, to be. Circa Survive is a good

Low GPA causes 
coach to cut losses 



By Monica Gerdeman 



The IPFW Men's Vol- 
leyball coach Amie Boll 
cut his losses Ibis year 
by eliminating a strong 
link from last year's ros- 
ter. Former team mem- 
ber Ben Duckworth will 
not be continuing with 
ihc IPFVV men's volley- 
ball program. Boosting 
the team's stats last year 
leading in kills, aces and 
second with the most 
points scored the cut will 
be large shoes to fill for 
the Volleydons. The only 
part that Duckworth 
lacked was in the class- 
room. 

"It may be a caulls 
thing to say, but if you 
arc not a team player on 
both sides (on the court 
and in the classroom,} 
then 1 just have to cut my 
losses," said Ball. 

As division I athletes, 
students are required 
to maintain a 2.0 grade 
point average after their 
freshman year to be eli- 



gible to participate in 
sports. If an athlete's GPA 
is lower than a 2.01, they 
get the chance to redeem 
it within the semester 
before the season. If the 
GPA docs not exceed a 
2.0, the athlete is no lon- 
ger allowed a spot on ihc 
team. 

"Its a shame that we 
had to lose a great player 
due to academic reasons. 
He was one of my closest 
friends on the team, but 
we all have to move for- 
ward and focus on this 
years season. I wish him 
all the best," said current 
player Phil Peterson. Til 
be the first one to admit 
that school isn't my fa- 
vorite thing in the world, 
but I am a "student-ath- 
lete." which means i'm a 
student first, then a vol- 
leyball player," Peterson 
finished. 

The Men's team starts 
their 2009-2010 season 
in lanuary. Coach Ball 
will be counting on his 
returning team members 
and six new faces to fill 
the stats that will not be 
returning.

lenyVeagleywas just another coach 
in a spori that kids in Indiana could 
hardly find equipment for in stores. 
In 1973, Indiana's men's soccer 
program was in its infancy. Veagley 
came from a tiny Pennsylvania town 
to basketball country lo nurture 
and raise a game few embraced. 
Now, with six national championships, 
16 College Cup appearances and the 
NCAA record for wins under his belt, 
Yeagley is one of seven inductees 
who will be inducted into the lU 
Hall of Fame Class of 2009 on Nov. 6. 
"This is one of the greatest honors 
anyone can receive," Yeagley said. "I 
am deeply honored. I have had a lot of 
good things come my way. I had one 
job for 41 years, and for me. it was the 
best possible job 1 could have. It was 
my dream job that turned into my 
passion." 

The then-physical education 
teacher took on a soccer program 
that, because of its club status, 
received no money from the school. 
Team promotions, travel and other 
expenses came from Yeagley's bank 
account for lOyearsuntillUmen'ssoccer 
was finally able to earn varsity status. 
"I have always been very much 
involved," he said. "1 felt it was 
my responsibility for me to help 
develop the game as it is today." 
Signs exhibiting conference titles. 



Ail-Americans and other program 
accomplishments, surround the 
field's perimeter as a constant 
reminder of lU's rich history. 
lU honored Yeagley by dedicating 
the pitch in his name in 2004, 
the fall after Yeagley's retirement 
and final national championship. 
'You've got to look ai (how) the 
program was siancd in '73 by coach 
Yeagley. and the 'Yeagley Way' has 
hopefully been there since day 
one." ID men's soccer coach Mike 
Freitag said. Former players and 
coaching staff members have said 
Yeagley's fame comes from the lives 
he touched during his time at lU. 
"There is so much good aboui coach," 
Freitag said. "His people skills are 
second to none. If he was a politician, 
he could probably be resident of the 
United Stales." 

Despite his success, Yeagley 
doesn't believe the hype. 
"I don't think of myself as a legend or 
immottalized," Yeagley said. "I am very 
fortunate for the opportunity i had. 
The University gave me all I needed 
to succeed. I get all of the honors, but 
there are so many who share them." 

Yeagley was also inducted 
into the National Soccer Coaches 
Association of America in 1989. 
More than individual awards, Yeagley 
said the most important part of his 
career is the program itself and what it 
means to him having helped raise lU 
soccer to the status it has today. 



Volleyball Opens Conference Play on the Road .k « 1 

BvLo,.p„ ^^F^^^^^m Communicator i 



The IPFW Women's Volleyball team headed to 
Cedar City, Utah to take on the Southern Utah Thun- 
derhirds in the opening match of the 2009 Summit 
League Conference play. The Volleydons played 
well, but dropped the match in four sets lo avoid be- 
ing swept (25-19, 25-15. 19-25. and 25-22). Rebekah 
Roehm had another big game for IPFW, picking up 
17 kills to go along with seven digs, leading the dons 
in both those categories for the night. In the first 
set, IPFW would manage to tie the match 6 times, 
but only take the lead once, which was not enough. 
The second set seemed to he much of the same and 
Southern Utah took that in almost the same fashion 
as the first. The third set was the high point for the 
dons on the night as IPFW trailed almost the whole 
way. Wlien the score was knotted at 20, the dons look 
off and won the third set. but only to drop the founh 
set and pick up their first loss in conference play. 

In the minds of the Dons, the weekend had 
just begun and tliey would head to the UniversiE&gt;' of 
Missouri- Kansas City to regain some momentum in 
Summit play, and they did. The dons nearly swept 
the Kangaroos, but look care of business in four sets. 
(25-18. 25-21, 21-25. 25- 14.) Once again there was big 
play from Rebekah Roehm as she and Mary Schlind- 
wein combined for 25 kills on the evening. The only 
sel to cause trouble all night for IPFW ivas the third 
set. which was close the whole way and someone had 
lo win the sel. and it just happened to be UKMC. The 
Dons would win the fourth sei in dominating fashion 
to end tlie match and reach a 4-5 record on the sea- 
son (l-l Summit League) reluming home for match- 
es September 15. 18, 19 for big home games.

minutes when Himtington argued for 
a hard-ball penalty in the box. They 
did not receive the call, however, and 
the play continued to close up the l-O
