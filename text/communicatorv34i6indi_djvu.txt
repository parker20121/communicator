Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne 




Current Mayor Graham Richard waits while challenger Linda Buskirk speaks. 

Walb hosts mayoral debate 



IPFW hosted the first of sev- 
eral debates being held for the 
I'tiri Wa\ nt' mayoral contest Sept. 
23. 

The debate, between current 
ivKivoi Graham Richard and chal- 
lenger Linda Buskirk, covered 
topics including downtown 



i-up, 



owth 






business, job growth ide 
informing indi\ Jdn.ils more about 
city government. They also 
addressed l he need lor more com- 
munity involvement and the 
increased education to help 
emplm ment opportunities. 

The Mike Downs Center for 
Indiana Politics of IPFW hosted 
the debate. 

IPFW political science pro- 
fessor Andrew Downs spoke of 



the strengths and weaknesses of 
both candidates. He is also the 
director of the Downs Center. 

"The goal of most candidates 
is to stay on message. To this 
point Linda Buskirk has been 
delivering a message that she has 
a plan for Fort Wayne and that she 
will listen to what people have to 
say, 1 ' Downs said. 

Fort Wayne's current execu- 

message, the professor explained. 
"Mayor Richard has been 
talking about his ability to take 
care of the basics and how that 
makes the city more attractive to 
businesses. Both managed to 
deliver their core message," he 

Each tried to cut into the 
other's credibility for the cam- 
paign, he noted. 

"Ms. Buskirk tried to make a 



case for many of Richard's 
achievements starting during the 
previous administration. Richard 
tried to demonstrate that his 
administration has been more 
efficient at providing the same 
services that Buskirk was respon- 
sible for as the Director of Public 
Works during the previous 
administration," he said. 

One IPFW junior in atten- 
dance, Sarah Wimer, said that the 
biggest thing that stood out her 
mind about the debate was "the 
way Buskirk was continually 
catching herself interrupting 
Richard." 

"It wouldn't have been as 
uncomfortable if she hadn't point- 
ed it out by saying something to 
the effect of she wouldn't get a 
word in if she didn't interrupt

Childcare at IPFW 'works amazingly well' 



By Melissa Rentfrow 

The Communicator 
For many IPFW students, depend- 
able — and affordable — child care 
can be a dilemma difficult to 
resolve with busy work and school 
schedules to reconcile. 

Fortunately, for IPFW stu- 
dents, faculty and staff, the solu- 
tion for this problem can be found 
on the corner of Stellhorn and 
Hobson Roads— the IPFW Child 
Care Center. 

The center provides child care 
for children ages 2 to 12 by a 
trained and qualified staff led by 
Lynda Place, Director of the IPFW 
Child Care Center. With four full- 
time and 20 part-time employees, 
the center's enrollment hovers 
around 200 children with kids 
arriving and departing on a rotat- 
ing basis each day. 

"It works amazingly well," 
Place said. 

Place also noted that of the 20 
part-time employees, most are 
IPFW students majoring in educa- 
tion, nursing and even psychology. 



All employees, including the 
student workers, are drug and TB 
tested as well as trained in CPR, 
first aid, positive disciplinary pro- 
cedures, emergency protocol, and 
health and safety. 

Place, a graduate of Purdue 
with a degree in elementary educa- 
tion and early-childhood special- 
ization, has been the director since 
1997. She notes many changes at 
the center during her tenure, espe- 
cially the Preschool Program newly 
opened this fall. 

"There isn't much gap 
between preschool and child care," 
she said, but recommended their 
new preschool for its flexibility 
since the time frames for the pro- 
gram can be combined with child 
care hours. This enables children to 
be transferred between child care 
and preschool, depending on what 
hours are most convenient for the 

Place is pleased with the inter- 
est in the new program, which cur- 
rently enrolls 22 children between 
the morning and afternoon pre- 
school sessions. She is also pleased

Opinions 



October 1, 2003 



Editorial 

Take time to cast a ballot 

"Ask not what your country can do for you, bill what you can do for your country." 
This quote by President John F. Kennedy may have been said in the 1960s, but it has relevance 
now more than ever. Tuesday, November 4, 2003 is Election Day and you have a right to vote 
in the election, if you are registered. 

But maybe you don't even care. Or maybe you are one of the "many" who say that 
their vote doesn't really matter. Or maybe you feel all candidates are the "same" - only their 
political party has a different name. Or perhaps due to the growth of non-partisan politics, 
you feel everyone wants the same laws, programs, etc. So why vote? 

If you are "very verbal" about politics, policies and candidates, but do nothing to 
become involved with your political parly, aren 't you doing yourself (and others) a great dis- 
service? In order to facilitate change, "new blood" has to be added periodically. New ideas 
have to be "born" by the leaders of the future. It's important to be up-to-date on the views 
and platforms of the candidates. Being an American gives us the freedom to choose and the 
right to express our opinions, but we need to support the politicians who are looking out for 
our needs. Our "backing" strengthens our own individual political convictions through our 
elected officials. 

You are aware of the 150 plus candidates in California vying for the governor's seat. 
There are a lot of unknowns running but there are also "famous " people in the mix from Gary 
Coleman to Larry Flynt to "action hero" Arnold Schwarzenegger. It will be interesting to see 
if the winner in this race is based on political experience or financial backing or even a 
"Kennedy connection." But in a 150 plus race, there should be a lot of reading involved to 
determine the differences between the candidates. How lucky we are in the Tort Wayne may- 
oral race - only two candidates. It shouldn 'I take that much time to explore the candidate's 
priorities. How many of you attended the Graham Richards-Linda Buskirk debate? 

It's time to take your opinion to the polls and it's not too late. Be American, get 
involved, make your vote count now. Your vote can make a difference. You need to stand up 
and be counted for what and who you believe. You can do "something for your country. " 
Vote. 

The Voter Registration Office is located at 602 S. Calhoun Street by the Landing. 
Their office hours are: 8:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. You may also register 
to vote at any license branch and voter registration forms are available at all Allen County 
Public Library locations. The deadline for registration to vote in this fall 's election is Monday, 
October 6.

Why Campus Ministry? 

By Ben Gates 

Special to The Communicator 

Why Campus Ministry at IPFW? That's a good question. 
After aft, it is not some private or religious college — never has 
been. And besides, each person is entitled to his or her own 
spiritual beliefs, aren't the}/? Is this office trying to force some 
sort of religious viewpoint on the rest of us? 

Why Campus Ministry at IPFW? That is indeed a good 
question. No, we don't try to compel any religious viewpoint 
on the campus community. And yes, each person is entitled to 
his or her own spiritual beliefs. In fuel, I would go further wi ' 
that thought. Each person is responsible for the spiritual pt 
spectivc they hold. And we all hold such a perspective, bv... 
someone who claims not to believe in God has established a 
spiritual worldview. Because we believe that students, faculty 
and staff are, at the very heart of things, spiritual beings, we 
believe that a Campus Ministry Office on campus is essential 
to the university experience. 

We respect the spiritual perspective of each member of the 
campus community. We would fight for their right to hold that 
perspective even if it differs from our own. And yet we offer 
stuaentSjfaculty and staff the invitation to consider the claims 
ofjesus Christ as they formulate their spiritual worldview. We 
e a Christian Campus Ministry. Does that mean that we are 
tolerant of a Muslim or Jewish religious perspective 
Absolutely not. We pursue dialogue with those who come from 
differing religious traditions. Nevertheless, we recognize dis- 
tinctives in tuorldzuew. We also believe that it is crucial to 
remind the academic community on an ongoing basis that the 
secular and the sacred, reason and faith, must be held in bal- 

■ in any honest intellectual search. 

Why Campus Ministry at IPFW? Another reason is that 
we believe a sense of community is a significant ingredient fc 
healthy campus life. At times, it appears that such comnuin 
ty is sorely lacking here. The Student Life Office works very 
hard to create a sense of community, as do so many other stu- 
dent groups. The nature of a commuter campus, hozvever, at 
least for this year, means that students often glide silently by 
each other on campus without developing meaningful relation- 
ships with each other. The Campus fmnistry student group 
offers various activities that we hope 'will nurture campus con 
munity. Bible studies, social events (like last years Euch, 
Party), and our fall retreat are all examples of community 
builders. Weekly Bible studies are at the heart of what w ' 

tudent can safely explore spiritual issues and questions 
there m a context of friendship." He or she can even expr't 
doubt about or anger toward God in that setting without ft 
of being rejected or embarrassed. We desire a reality to o 
gatherings that is often sadly missing in the average American 
church. 

Campus Ministry at IPFW also offers the service-minded 
_ tudent the opportunity to help the neediest of the Fort Wayne 
community and beyond. We sponsor a group called S.E.R.V.E. 
that engages in monthly service projects, in October, we will 

serving a meal at the Fort Wayne Rescue Mission. I 
November, we will be helping to build a local Habitat fc 
Humanity house. And next March, we combine service loith a 
spring break mission experience. Wc will be taking students to 
the Bahamas to do low-skill construction work, painting and 
children's ministry. We will build relationships with '' 



Bahamian churches we 
unique culture. We will stay 



and will taste their 
hotel on the beach, get the 



ay in a hotel on the beach, get the 
cruise ship experience over and back, liave a morning of snor- 
keling and still be able to help some desperately needy people in 
the process. All for $1,080 including airfare to and from Fort 
Lauderdale, Florida! 1 love these mission trips because the}/ 
always provide the environment for students to grow and learn 
more about themselves and about the Lord. Invest your spring 
break with us in the Bahamas. 

The Catholic Campus Minister, Sister Pat\ 
Murray, and I are always available to talk to students who

he did so with a great deal more 
class, which is something people 
would like to see in their elected 
officials,'' Wimer noted. 

Wimer also said that if the 
election were held tomorrow she 
would likely vote for Richard. She 
felt he seemed more aware of local 
and national economics. 

Downs noted there are both 
benefits and drawbacks to seeing it 
on television and in person. 

"When you are watching it on 
television, it is possible to focus on 
the faces of the candidates and 
what they are saying. You are not 
distracted by other things happen- 
ing in the studio audience or by the 
off-camera movements or the other 
candidate and the crew. You also 
see the faces better and for some 
people that is important," he said. 

"When you are in the studio 
you see the off-camera movements 
of the other candidate and might

notice a candidate roll their eyes, 
make a face or do something that 
the audience is not supposed to 
see," Downs added. 

In the studio, it's hard to see 
faces with clarity and it's easy to be 
distracted. On TV, it's possible to 
mi;.;, body language or find sincer- 
ity in actions. The differences can 
be dramatic, he said. 

"The best of both worlds is to 
watch the debate in the studio and 
watch it on television later," he 

Downs thinks future debates 
need more flexibility in format. 

"It would be good to give the 
moderator the latitude to allow for 
some parts of the debate to go on 
for longer than others if the discus- 
sion is productive. Doing this will 
require a great deal of trust on the 



part of the candidates because it 
will be possible for the moderator 
to let the debate continue in a way 
that is detrimental to one of the 
candidates," he said. 

Downs also wanted students 
to know that debates "are a good 
place to hear the basic messes ot 
the candidates and make an 
informed decision on whom they 
will vote for.

Author reexamines the

after the shots had been fired.

"Why would someone have an 
open umbrella on a sunny day?" 
author John H. Gordon 



He 



of President John F. Kennedy has 
marked a spot in American minds 
since that Dallas day in 1963. 

Gordon brought his theories 
and a discussion to IPFW courtesy 
of Student Activities Board last 

Along with JFK's murder, the 
assassination of Robert Kennedy 
has stumped minds as well. 

There are many theories and 
possibilities as to what exactly 
unfolded with each murder, but no 
one is precisely sure of what hap- 

Gordon has devoted much of 
his fife trying to determine what 
exactly happened to each man. 

With John F. Kennedy, Gordon 
has developed his own theory with 
supporting evidence to prove there 
was more than one gunman taking 
aim on the grassy knoll that day. 

Crucial evidence to support 
how Kennedy actually died was 
hidden by the government, he 
believes. Statements released by 
doctors and witnesses changed 
during interrogations by the CIA. 
Another sketchy fact is that the 
autopsy was not conducted in 
Dallas; rather it was done in a 
Naval Hospital. 

"None of the doctors had 
autopsied bullet wounds," Gordon 
said. Because of that, he claims 
much of the evidence obtained by 
doctors in Dallas was either left out 
or changed to support the findings 
of the Naval autopsy. 

Gordon believes the assassi- 
nation was a conspiracy involving 
three major factors. These factors 
had close relations to Kennedy 
before and during his campaign 
and into the start of his presidency. 
Gordon developed a triad of inter- 
ventions of groups involved. One 
point are the Anti-Castro Cubans. 
This group was out to get him due 
to his lack of involvement with 
Cuba during the Cold War. 
Another point was organized 
crime syndicates. This group finan- 
cially supported Kennedy's run for 
office, and after being elected he 



after them. The third point of the 
triad was the lower echelon CIA. 

These members were in 
cahoots with organized crime 
members and the Anti-Castro 
Cubans possibly helping them gain 



The head of all this was not 
Lee Harvey Oswald like many 
believed, according to Gordon. 

"He was the lowest level of 
shooter in the Marines. There's 
Marksman, Sharp Shooters, then 
Experts" Gordon said. 

The theory he created sup- 
ports Jack Ruby as the leader. 

"He was the logical choice for 
organizing. He had connections 
everywhere." Gordon stated. 

Another key point was the 
man in the film with the umbrella. 
"Why would someone have an 
open umbrella on a sunny day?" 
Gordon asked. 

According to research and 
examination of the film evidence 
proves that the umbrella was 
moved in a manner suggesting 



Kennedy assassination for the 
more than a decade. His plate is 
never empty; this fall alone he is 
undertaking 20 lectures. He has 
also been a consultant for NOVA 
on PBS, 20/20 on ABC, Kennedy 
on NBC and an advisor for the 
California State Archives.

There's also the fact that govern- 
ment cover-ups began happening, 
he suggests. The FBI, CIA and even 
the media kept the public from 
hearing what actually happened, 
Gordon theroizes. 

No matter what would come 
about they would support their 
beliefs with one volume of the 
Warren Commission statements, 
not all 26, he said. 

Gordon's interest in the assas- 
sinations began when he saw the 
news during his eight grade study 
hall. 

"I never got over it" he said. 
Ever since then, Gordon has been 
interviewing witnesses, collecting 
evidence, and developing theories 
about what happened. 

He has traveled all over the 
country, including to Dallas, to find 
out what truly happened. During 
enrollment at Ball State, Gordon 
formed study groups in the dorms 
where they discussed what hap- 
pened. 

He has been teaching history 
since the early 1980's and began

The Foster family enjoys some dinner during the IPFW Students with Families gathering 
Friday. Among the special guests during the night -- along with the children of IPFW stu- 
dents - was Spongebob Squarepants ~ straight from Bikini Bottom. 

The IPFW campus family 



It was a day to remember 
for children of all ages. Yes 
indeed, Spongebob had 
Squarepants arrived from Bikini 
Bottom to welcome IPFW stu- 
dents with families. 

Screams of joy could be heard 
from all corners of Walb student 
union Friday, September 26. 
Refreshments were generously 
donated by Pizza Hut for all to 

Coloring supplies were avail- 
able for all children and bal- 
loons were flying everywhere 
towards the beginning of the 
evening. By the time Spongebob 
arrived at around 7:30, only a 
handful of balloons were found 
still intact. 

Before Spongebob's arrival, 
many contests were held. They 
included a coloring contest for 
children in different age groups, 
and a dress up contest for a few 
of the male adults, including 
IPFW student Doug Olsen who 
dressed as the Chiquita Banana 
lady. 

At 7:30 children were told to 
leave the floor and welcomed 
Spongebob loudly. Though a bit 
reluctant to do so, all children 
left the floor. It was then that 
Spongebob entered, and kids 
tried to squirm out of their par- 
One child, 4-year old Tayah 
Ryan, escaped from mother 
Becky Ryan and rushed to 
Spongebob's side. 

But Spongebob must have 
had his tie too tight and blacked 
out, because he didn't seem to 
notice the tiny toddler at his 
side. 

She then rushed back to her 
mother. 

"She loves Spongebob so 
much. We have all of his tapes 
at home. She just got a little 
overwhelmed at the sight of 
him and had to meet him,'' her 
mother said.

The preschool curriculum is 
housed in its own room and focus- 
es on social-emotional develop- 
ment, physical development, cog- 
nitive development and language 
development. It is based on the 
principles found in "The Creative 
Curriculum for Preschool. 1 ' The 
preschool program also adheres to 
the practices advocated by the 
National Association for the 
Education of Young Children. 

"And we can do some field 
trips," Place added with a smile. 

Even without leaving the cen- 
ter, children in preschool and child 
care have many play activities, 
including outdoor play during nice 
weather. A tour of the center's 
grounds reveals a large, fenced 
grassy area with a sandbox, play 
set, a hard surface for riding toys 
and a child-sized basketball hoop. 
Inside the center, each room is col- 
orfully decorated with pictures as 
well as artwork made by the chil- 

Also, the furnishings in the 
center are appropriately sized for 
smaller bodies, including tables, 
chairs, bathrooms, sinks, water 
fountains, cots for naps and toys. 
There are learning centers with

ulatives, computers and rotating

Additionally, each room is 
equipped with a microwave and 
refrigerator, which is convenient 
for parents, who must bring their 
child's meals with them if they are 
to be served at the center. Once a 
semester, parents also donate milk 
and nonperishable snacks or juice 
to be distributed to the classes. 

For younger children, parents 
are also required to provide their 
own diapers. Each child has 
labeled shelf space in the specially 
designated changing area for these 
supplies. In addition, parents are 
asked to supply a box of baby 
wipes each semester to offset the 
additional costs of changing sup- 
plies. 

Keeping the center an afford- 
able child care option for students 
also limits the amount of time thai 



children c 
hours per week. (The preschool 
hours do not count toward the 20- 
hour rule.) This limit is necessary 
to avoid official licensure, which 
would increase the cost per child 
by requiring that the center pro- 
vide all meals for the children- 
even for those not attending dur- 
ing meal times. 

Unfortunately, the 20-hour 
limit does disqualify some stu- 
dents from using the center's serv- 
ices, depending on the student's 
program requirements. 

"It leaves out student teachers 
and some nursing students who 
need to be in school (activities] fur 
more than 20 hours," Place said. 

Still, the center is able to offer 
a wide variety of hours to accom- 
modate students attending classes 
at all times of the day. Operating 
hours vary slightly depending on 
the season, but fall and spring 
hours are currently set from 7:45 
a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through 
Thursday and 7:45 p.m. to 5 p.m. 

Evening care is offered 
depending on enrollment, and the 



center is closed during scheduled 
university vacations and weather- 
related shutdowns. 

Although flexibility is an asset 
to parents using the center, afford- 
ability remains &lt;me of the greatest 
benefits. IPFW students are 
required to pay a $10 registration 
fee each semester per child in I, ill 
and spring; hourlv rates include $3 
per hour for 2-year-olds, and S2.H0 
per hour for 3 to 12-year-olds. 

Occasional or drop in care is 
also a\ ailahle for S3. 7s" per hour for 
students, depending on space and 
staffing limitations. All applica- 
tions for enrollment are accepted 
on a first-come, first-serve basis, 
and a copy of the student's class 
schedule is required at the time of 
registration. 

For more information about 
the center, students are encouraged 
to call 485-4187. Brochures with 
more detaled information about 
the child care and preschool 
options are available. Prospective 
parents are encouraged to schedule 
an appointment or stop in during 
business hours for a tour of the

"We have ihree different type 
of payment plans," she said. A per- 
son can pay a lump sum; an install- 
i urn I plan for 12 or 10 months; or a 
financial aid plan. The financial aid 
plan would entail paying 10 per- 
cent at beginning, 40 percent when 
first financial aid check comes in 
and 50 percent when second check 
comes in at beginning of second 
semester. 

"It's more (financially) friend- 
ly for the students, 1 ' she said. 

And there are good reasons to 
consider becoming a CA as well, 
she said. 

"They get to leave in a four 
bedroom-two bath. They do not 
have to pay for that room. And 
they get a $100 stipend per month," 
Henson said. 

Applications will be taken for 
those positions in January. 

More literature is available in 
the Kettler Hall office or by calling 
481-1180. 

The reality of student housing 
is becoming more and more evi- 
dent every day, Henson said. 
"They're doing really well with 
construction. Every day there's 
brick up or siding up," 



The rates vary from size of the 
dwelling to length of stay. A person 
who agrees to a 12-month stay as 
opposed to a 10-month contract. A 
one-bedroom/one bath fully fur- 
nished apartment for a full year 
would cost $570 a month - or $600 
a month for a 10 month plan That 
floor plan has about 510 square feet 
of space, according to student 
housing literature. 

Prices go lower from there, 
with a four-bed room /two bath 
unit costing $379 a month per 
dweller. The four-bedroom plan 
has 1,060 square feet of space. 
Henson said its possible friends 
may get together for this type of 

The apartments all also have a 
living area and a kitchen. 

Each unit has private bed- 
rooms with keys for the bedrooms 
- and security at the community 
will be three tiered. Swipe cards 
will be necessary to get on the com- 
munity, and a key will be needed to 
get into a unit, with a second key 
needed to gain access to any bed-

Fort Wayne gets Too Darn Hot 7 with 'Kiss Me Kate'

face, ablaze with emotion. After acting his

movie version of the play (starring Howard

Of course, I was going to compare them

for blunders from the cast, crew, and orchestra.

accent. One of the characters, Petruchio, (pro- 
nounced "pe-tru-she-o" in the movie) was

for what it's worth... 
i'm slightly nuts 



by scott m. lawson 



My troubles weren 't 
based on some ongoing 
family trauma or abu- 
sive nights with a guy 
named Bubba 

Hookhands. 



No, seriously, I've been diagnosed. 

Technically, nobody likes using the word 
"nuts" anymore - so when 1 say "nuts," med- 
ical professions say "mildly bi-polar." 

Ifs no big deal. Medical professionals 
have also diagnosed me as "hypoglycemic" 
and "embarrassingly pasty white." 

So I watch my sugar and sun intake, and 
with the bi-polar thing, I watch my depres- 
sion intake. 

I bring up this topic not to scare away 
friends, but because next week is Depression 
Awareness week. IPFW will host an informa- 
tional day on Oct. 9 from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. in 
Walb Union. 

My story is like many others, but to each 
person dealing with it, the pain is unique. 

In the fall of 1998, there was something 
wrong with me. Well, there's always been 
something wrong with me, but that's my 
"He's a bit odd" factor. 
This wasn't odd. This was 
a "God, I really don't tike 
the laughter of birds and 
chirping of small children 
anymore" situation. 

So I went into self- 
destruct mode. Kind of 
like the Starship 
.Enterprise {in The Wrath Of Khan, not 
Generations), I was ticking into bad habits. If 
memory serves (and some of it probably 
doesn't because of the heavy drinking of 
these days) there was a lot of, well, heavy 

t showing up to work on rime, 
and of having sex with a woman I hardly 
knew in my cubical after work hours. 

On face value, this might not seem like a 
bad idea, but I think my subconscious desire 
was to have my boss catch me misusing my 
desktop calendar - leading tu my firing. He'd 
been pretty patient with my tardiness. 

And by that happening, my longtime girl- 
friend would realize what a bad person I 
was, and she would have to end our four- 
year relationship with a flip of her finger. 

I was spending the weekends curled up 
on my couch fearing phone calls from collec- 
tion agencies and informing me I was now 
$6,560 in debt. 

As opposed to the $6,120 in debt I'd been 
the previous month. Credit card finance and 
late fees can be painful. 

So here it was. I feared my job, my girl- 
friend, my debt, myself. I drank like every 
bad stereotype of an alcoholic. 

My boss had assigned me a story about the 
local Depression Screening. So I talked to a 
:; the 




t about the details and \ 



The next night, I decided I probably should 
screen myself for depression. It was either 
depression, or I really was the world's oddest 
fellow. And while I perceive myself as odd, 
I'm not David Koresh odd - just Weird Al 
odd. 



determined my head 
needed some checking. 
It felt good to talk to 
someone about my 
thoughts - with some- 
one who knew how to 
dig the underlying 
troubles up so that I 
could start to slowly 
deal with them. 

My troubles weren't 
based on some ongoing 
family trauma or abu- 
sive nights with a guy named Bubba 
Hookhands. It was based in a situation that 
had taken place 15 years earlier - a friend's 
suicide. I had never come to terms with what 
she meant to me, or why I couldn't stop her 
when I was a 12-year-old. 

They wanted to prescribe anti-depressants 
- a fairly standard proced' 

but cautious. 
"Well," I asked, "what are th&gt; 

side effects?" 

"For this medication, then 

may be a few. It could lead ti 

dry mouth. And possible con 

stipation and/or diarrhea 

Also, there are 

effects," he told m 
And, by the way, it was going t. 
er $80 a month. 

Now, the dry mouth didn't mat

And one of the things that had mi 

month seemed a bad idea. 

So I denied the pill - however I promised 
that, if things didn't improve, I would con- 
sider it again. I was able to do that, but not 
everybody should. One of my closest friends 
was on Paxil for years because she needed it. 
And, come to find out, my boss was also on 
anti-depressants. 

He was a pretty clever guy, sending me to 
cover that story. 

Knowing what the troubles were, I was able 
to target them with other therapies. 

It took a lot of talking 
ones. It led to a break-up and a lot of tea 
There were some more endless nights, t 
instead of alcohol, I typed out my 

Not buying as much alcohol, I was able to 
pay some bills on time (funny how that 
works). Not being hungover every day, I was 
able to show up to work on time - well, as on 
time as I get. And 

and then winter went into the spring of 1999, 
I started to feel a bit of sunshine again. 

Not to be melodramatic, but 
sensation to care about the chirping kids and 
laughing birds. Not to be weighed ti- 
the depression. 

It's like my hypoglycemia and my embar- 
rassingly pasty whiteness. It is a factor in my 
life. ,

Lady VolleyDons get back on winning track 




Oregon State at California. 
The Golden Bears are coming off 
of a huge victory over No, 3 
ranked USC and want to keep the 
momentum moving against the 
Beavers of Oregon State. One 
problem: Oregon State's offense 
has put up big numbers thus far 
into the season thanks to running 
back Steven Jackson. The Beavers 
have been teetering on the edge of 
the top 25 rankings and should be 
able to slide in after this victory. 

Prediction: Oregon State. 

Indiana at Michigan State. 
The Spartans are on a rolllllllUlll 
right now and can't be stopped. 
You all know how bad IU football 
is. There is no way the Hoosiers 
win this game. NO WAY Okay, 
maybe one way Stop Jeff Smoker. 
But that is not going to happen. 

Prediction: Michigan St. 

Michigan at Iowa. 

Michigan's offense has not looked 
good the past two weeks. John 
Navarre is struggling with his 
accuracy and receivers are drop- 
ping eggy baUs,__^£&gt;n the other 
hand, the formerly No. 9 ranked 
Hawkeyes just lost to Michigan 
State and plummeted in the polls. 
Is the chip on their shoulder big 
enough to defeat the Wolverines? 
Doubt it. 

Prediction: Meeeechigan. 

Kansas State at Texas. No. 14 
at No. 13. A healthy Ell Roberson 
and Darren Sproles should propel 
the Cougars to victory, but 1 have 
my doubts. Their offense is real 
good, but their defense is suspect 
against big teams. California and 
Marshall have combined for 48 
points against K. State, one caus- 
ing the Cougars a victory. Texas 
isn't as dominant as the past few 
years, but are still a very good 

Prediction: Texas 
Tennessee at Aubum. A 

showdown in the dirrrrrty south. 
Aubum has bounced back after 
starting the season 0-2 in embar- 
rassing fashion. They have finally 
established the running game that 
was supposed to propel them to 
National Championship level in 
many preseason predictions. But 
Tennessee is undefeated for a rea- 
son and Casey Clausen is a pre- 
miere quarterback in the college 
football ranks. I'm actually having 

trouble with this one Ah,heck 

with it. I'm calling the mild upset. 
Prediction: Aubum

Mens Soccer splits weekend matche s 



By Staff and News Services 

Last weekend, IPFW's men's 
soccer team competed in the 
Southwest Missouri State tourna- 
ment in Springfield, Missouri. 

IPFW and Southwest 
Missouri State had to wait out an 
hour and a half lightning delay on 
Friday night, on the first day of the 



week because Notre Dame doesn't 
play anyone. Oh, dam. Maybe 
the Bluderin' Irish can figure out 
how to win. Until they do, I won't 
stop bashing. 

By the way, I'm 13-2 this sea-

achy breaky heart" because I just 
don't think it'll understand how

IPFW golf teeing up for success 



Men 's team may 
start in spring; 
women next fall 

By Nick West 

The Communicator 

Mark Pope wanted the "right 
person." The requirements: Fluid 
in northeastern Indiana's golf 
tongue, a proper disposition to 
handle collegiate student-athletes, 
a prior golf teaching experience, 
and a high integrity. 

When rumors began to swirl 
lasl summer about a goll program 
at IPFW, a handful of people threw 
their name into the hat. Some were 
seasoned, others raw, but only one 
fit the "right person" mold. 

Enter Jeff Marsh With more 
than a decade of experience as a 
PGA of America member, an assis- 
tant golf professional at Pine Valley 
Country Club in Fort Wayne, 
Legends of Indiana Golf Course, 
and Deer Track, and now head pro- 
fessional of the latter, Marsh was a 
front-runner for the position, 

Born and raised a Hoosier and 



graduate of DeKalb High School, 
he knew talent lay in this area of 
the state. And at a mere 30-some- 
Ihing, would bring a youthful 
vivacity typical of a young coach. 

"I was so firmly convinced that 
Jeff was our right guy, that we 
decided to go forward," Pope said 
o( appointing Marsh the new head 
golf coach. 

Golf was an athletic program at 
IPFW in the late 1980's and early 
1990's but faded out. He is not the 
school's first golf coach, but Marsh 
is IPFW's first women's and 
Division 1 teams' headman. 

He was ecstatic about Pope's 
decision. 

"I am very excited about it. 
IPFW has picked a good rime to 
initiate a program. Fort Wayne is a 
pretty much a golfer's environ- 
As Pope scoured northeast 
Indiana (or a home course, he came 
upon one of the top facilities in 
Indiana, Deer Track. Mike Thomas 
of Mike Thomas Realtors and 
owner of the course, kindly donat- 
ed it for IPFW's use as a home facil- 
ity. 



"It was almost too good to be true," 
Pope joked, "I get the course and 
the head professional." 

Deer Track is known for it?s 
tremendous practice range and two 
indoor practice tunnels; but per- 
haps the course's chief attribute is 
its proximity to IPFW. A simple 
ten-minute stroll up Tonkel Road 
and presto. Deer Track. 

Pope and Marsh are both anx- 
ious to get the program off of the 
ground in the spring of 2004, but 
realistically, fall of 2005 is expected. 
The spring team would consist 
only of current IPFW students 
because potential recruits would be 
finishing their respective high 
school tenures. 

Several IPFW students have 
expressed interest in playing for 
the new teams, many of who have 
played golf at other Division 1 
schools and have transferred back 
to IPFW for various reasons. 

"My first hope is to use current 
students. They deserve the best 
shot at it and it's easier to recruit 
them," said Pope. 

When the recruiting process 
begins, both Pope and Marsh are 



New head coach Jeff Marsh has sched- 
uled a meeting for any male interested 
in the school's new program. The meet- 
ing will be at Deer Track Golf Course on 
Monday, October 6 at 8 p.m. Call Coach 
Marsh at 260-481-4161 or SID Rudy 
Yovich at 260-481-6646 or Assistant SID 
Brian Miller 260-481-6372. 



conlident ihev &lt;..u\ attr.n. t are.) high 
school talent to the new golf pro- 
grams. For the recruits, the initial 
appeal is the idea of a fresh pro- 
gram. 

"There is better chance that they 
might be able to play," said Pope. 

At larger schools with estab- 
lished programs, the student-ath- 
lete has only an outside shot of fill- 
ing a roster spot. With a new pro- 
gram such as IPFW's, all roster 
spots are open for competition. 

"A lot it has to do with loca- 
tion," said Pope. 

Indeed, as the idea of staying 
close to home but still competing 
for a Division 1 program would 



bode well for a Fort Wayne area 
high school athlete. 

Marsh also attributes IPFW's 
academics as a healthy portion of 
influence for a student athlete. 

"Academics will play a big part 
in it," he said. "I don't want some- 
body out there playing golf and 
ignoring their schooling." 

IPFW is now fully stanch to the 
development of men and women's 
goif programs, A dedicated athletic 
director, youthful coach, mar- 
velous home course, a fertile area 
of high school talent, and the 
notion of a fresh sport make IPFW 
golf an exciting prospect for the 
school's future.

The bases are only 64 apart and the bat-

be found playing the game that they love. 
It's the Lady Mastodim's Softball team. 

The Lady 'Dons will be finishing up their 
fall season October 4th when they battle at 
Illinois, Chicago. 

The fall season which consists of only a 
few games, brings the question to mind. 
Why is it so short? 



"The fall season is a non-traditional sea- 
son that basically gives us a chance to mix 
the new girls with the young girls," said 
Keith Fisher head coach of the team. 

"This just gives us a little way to see what 
we have for the upcoming season." 

During the offseason the team will condi- 
tion three days a week: Mondays, 
Wednesdays, and Fridays, where they will 
perform strength and conditioning exercises 
to prepare for the season in the spring.
