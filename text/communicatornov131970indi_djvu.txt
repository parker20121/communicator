PENNIES 

FROM 

HEAVEN 

Tliis year's Penny Carnival 
was a huge success. Around 
120 orphans from the Allen 
County Children's Home, Stale 
School and St. Vincent's Villa 
were Ireoted to a wonderful 
evening browsing the ten booths. 
8267.05 "as collected (an in- 
crease of about J40 from last 
year) to be donated to St. Vin- 
cent's Villa for the purchase of 
recreational equipment. 

I&gt;. Manges, Dr. Stanley 
Lee, and Dr. Jack Ulmer judged 
tbe booths and [pve three tro- 
phies. Phi Gamma Rho won the 
"best overall" trophy for. their 
"County Club Hinature Golf." 
Dental Assistants woo the 
"most enthusiastic" trophy for 
their "ffhooz Zoo." "The Bar- 
ber Shop," where children 
shaved plastic faces to a chorus 
•of barbershop music, brought 
Alpha Psi Onega the "most 
creative" trophy. 

Alpha Epsilon Kappa spon- 
sored "Dunk the FVofessots." 
"Rolling Rocks" was sponsored 
by the Geology Club. Circle K 
sponsored two projects, one 
being a handwriting analysis 
booth and the other being a 
squirt gun shooting gallery. 
Kappa Delta Thela gave a 
"Bean Bag Throw." and Deatal 
Hvgenists sponsored "Catch a 
Falling Star." Alpha Phi One- 
ga showed "Ye Olde Flicks," 
a series of cartoons and films. 
The University Singers and a 
folk .group performed at frOO 

Many thanks go to the stu- 
dents who adopted the children 
for the evening. The children 
really enjoyed everything, espe- 
cially the "adopters," who were 
so nice to them. As one official 
from the State School said, 
"They'll remember this evening 
for a long time,"

DISCUSS PROBLEMS OF 

CAMPUS BOOKSTORE 



November 13, 1970 



Inner City Project Embarked 




by Sieve Spollman 

The Circle K Club of the 
1U-PU Regional Campus is and 
again embarking on a program 
to help those in the inner city. 
Club members are forming u 
tutoring program whereby col- 
lege students at the rcgionul 
campus will receive a chunee 
to tutor a grade school student 
in the inner city. The program 
will require the college student 
to spend only an hour each week 
at an inner city school teaching 
n student who needs help.

from the AEK Coffee House presented last Wed. 
~l~d~da v AEK frat- At the present 

mother of their coffe- Bookstore is advisir 



sen ted Mr. James Guseman and 
Mr- Hatch (manager and assis- 
tant manager of the Campus 
Bookstore). Mr. Guseman made 
no prepared speech, as the 
purpose of his presentation 
was to bring out facets of Book- 
store policy by the means of 
student questions 

As a member of the National 
Follct Corporation, the Book- 
store must operate within a 
certain structure and set of 
rules. The Bookstore's hands 
are tied economically. Mr. 
Guseman explained that "We do 
not price any book ia that book- 
store." The publisher sends 
on' invoice with all books 
bought by the bookstore, and 
they set a price 20% over that. 

There ore various basic 
criteria to be judged when 
dealing with buying - back of 
books. Tbe Bookstore itself 
sells used books at 75% of the 
list price. In one case, the 
student is refunded all money 
for his book; this tomes when 



to wait until the professors' 
turn in their list or ncKl semes- 
ter's books before they sell. A 
book thai could only be bought 
at wholesale value aow may be 
bought thea at 505. There is a 
wholesale price list of all 
books available for the students 
to consult when they sell books 
baok, and Vu\ Guseman urges 
Btudents to use it. 

There has been some 
trouble this year with books not 
being available. Of the two 
reasons for this, one is that the 
publisher just docs not send 
the ordered books 
store. Mr. Guscma 
has spent much lir 
phone, pleading 
lisher. One other 
sudden enrollment increase

up to teach and seeing at what

Some student hostility has 
been noticed and acknowledged 
about the fact that staff members 
get a 10% discount. This policy 
was in effect when \fr. Guseman 
took over management of the 
Bookstore. \t. Guseman fears 
alienation of the staff should

In flag football, the regular 
season is over. Starling Nov. 
)5th the six teams with the best 
records; Wetting, Aschbacher, 
Press ley, Brogan, llalley, and 
Jolianus milt compete in a pbiy- 
off for the championship. 

In looking back over the 

that they enjoyed playing, and 
that many would be back next 
year. None of the boys teams 
would pick a "Most Valuable 
Playef from their team. The 
captains said it um a team ef- 
fort, and that all the players 
were valuable. It teas different 
with the girls team however. 
The members of Pine's team 
said that if they were to give a 
MVP awatd, U would go to Pine 
herself. On Cleland's team the 
MVP award would probably go 
to Messerschmidt. 

The new look in flag foot- 
ball this year was, of course, 
the girb teams. When asked 
why they were playing, the 
girls said that since they had 
to pay the athletic fee they were 
going to get some good out of 
it. The boys, however, did not 
particularly like the idea. Some 
said that although it wc 
playing the girls, it jus

THE LOCK 



by J.5.D. 
In Easy Rider you saw the background and chamctcri union of people totally 
involved wilh the drag scene. They were introduced as the typical junkie pusher 
You sow how they passed from ™ e stage l0 another, the final being extermination 
at the hands of the -'straight" God-fearing pro-Anericon. 

Joe develops the identity of that element that destroyed them. A brief back- 
ground of what draws a "normal" law abiding citizen into a criminal behavior pat- 
tern is presented. We see a girl from an upper class (4S60.000/ycar bracket) fam- 
ily sharing a pad, a mattress, and bath with a needle-popping pusher. When she is 
taken to the hospital for treatment of u speedy trip. Daddy goes to the pad to prove 
to himself that his daughter's transmissions were not his fault. 

In the interlude that follows he winds up killing his daughter's beau and takes 
the junky's shopping bag full of goodies. He is countered and teemed with a cha- 
racter whom he meets in a bar (the 'American' no less). From this man, 'Joe', 
he is given nationalization for his evil deeds. Joe intimidates Mr. Well-to-do to 
enter into further exploits as a protection of Mother, the Dag, and apple pie. 

Joe is a powerful man of motivation without initiation. Mr. Well-to-do gives 
him the initiation. Together they take on a hippy commune in upstate New York. 
The resultant of which is a sad realization that is frozen on the screen and im- 
bedded in the brains of the audience. 

Joe is a real mover financially as can be attested by the VARI ETY score- 
board. It is rated (R) this year. Threeyears ago it would have been (X). It still 
should be. Go stag and you might appreciate it. Take a dute and you'll fail to 
pay attention to the story line because you'll only worry about how it is affecting 
your date. Friedland and Dewey, the directors, used a couple nice tricks to indi- 
cate a loss of reality. Other than that, Joc_ is a very casual (near amoture) pro- 
duction. You'll either dig Joe or be repulsed by it. I won't tell you which-you'll 
have to answer that for yourself at the Theatre A.

Jon Scott Duffei is doing

As we crowd more and more 
people into our country, we 
continually run into more and 
more problems of waste dispo- 
sal. Somehow we have to gel 
rid of all the trash and sewage 
created by these additional peo- 
ple. Unfortunately, we cannot 
afford adequate sewage treat- 
men t-we have to spend our 
money for more schools and col- 
leges (just look around you) for 
the increasing population. So 
we dump the sewage into our 
lakes and rivers. The predict- 
able result is that after a period 
of time the lakes and rivers 
become "dead." The fish and 
wildlife die and we have a 

ful and beautiful natural re- 
source. Re also dump vast 
quantities of waste into the 
atmosphere -over 500 pounds 
per year for each person in the 
country. When it gets bade- 
nough we call it smog and it 
keeps us from seeing the sce- 
nery'. In Los Angeles one of 
the worst smog areas, people 
talk wistfully of someday having 
1940 quality air. 

Is there any hope for stop- 
ping population growth? Yes, 
il is a realistic possibility. 
Some European countries have 
reached this goal. All that it 
requires is that the average fa- 
mily be two children. If there 
are only two children in a fami- 
ly, then the net long term growth 
is zero, because one child re- 
places the father and the olher 
replaces the mother. In the 
United States it is that third 
and fourth child in a family that 
is causing the population growth.
