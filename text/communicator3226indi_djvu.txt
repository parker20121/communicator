Tyncr ciicd several reasons 
why designing a suilahlc logo was 
Uiflicull. 

Firsl. IPFW is a very long

and a need for increased recognition 
by people ouisidc (he immcdiaie

unlveisily outside the immediate 
area many people need lo see the 
word "imiversily' or Ihc letter 'U' 
in (he logo. Tyner said. 

Additionally, the logo design 
had 10 be easy to use in prim publi- 

'A local agency developed a

thought of having hundreds, per- 
tups thousands of sirangers reel-

rather unnerving for this reason.

we make a judgmeni on single, 
rare events that happen in a per- 
son's life, I remember words that 



1 hatt: spoken and ei-cn worse, 
opinions thai I haic formed about 
other people 

Opinions or thoughts about 
someone are perfectly fine. They 
are not acceptable when no real, 
upfront information lo support 
these suspicions exists. 1 am noi 
speafcmg of hunches or theories. 
Instead 1 am interring about whis- 
pered fabricauoas. They thrive m 
our minds, stampede from our 
mooihs and radiau: dirough our 
actions. No matter how much 
effort we put into creating a palat- 
able illusion, our thoughts always 
transcend onto Ihe world ouKidc 
our minds through a look, gesture. 

All of us have fell thai 
unruly knot (hat fonns in our 

one has ill thoughts about us. I[ is 
one of the mosi uncomfortable, 
uiking feelings around. We don'i 
know of any juslifiable reason tot 
another person to hold a negative 
image of us. Not knowing gnaws 
al our brains, 

1 have spent an endless 
amount of time (without realizing 
il) analyj^ng a brief encounter (hat 
I had with another person that 



seemed out of sync. Some of the 
questions (hat first strike my 
thoughts are "What did I do or 
what did they doT" The questions 
go on and on until the whole situ- 
alion ha.s been lalionalued. Tlie 
creation of a new false image has 
been corapleied. All of us go 
through a lot of trauma via the 
opinions other people form. 
Unfotlunaiely, whispered fabrica- 
tions are a very imponani and 
pott-crful curie in our society. 

Wc arc all guilty victims of 
concocted supposiiions. Wc all 
despise il and yet we all panici- 
paie in it. Someday, many of you 
may tire of this endless cycle. I 
am one person who is very lired 
of (he mcny-go-round. 1 really 
don'l know what can be tlone, bui 
I believe I can give something id 
think about. 

Wc always tell each oUicr 
not to be so self-conscious. 
However, self-consciousness is 
something we will carry forever 
unul people smp forrtung false 
images. TTiink of how you would 
feel if you fell "free" to sky-dive, 
dye your hair purple or dance in 
front of thousands of people. 



It sccnu those good memories give me rea.son not to guard, 
(ust drop out of school and just slay at home u-au:hing 
Scooby Doo cartoons. I suppose I could wriie about my 
unfonunaLe life experience, bul who really wants to be 
depressed'.' Or I could write about something totally unre- 
lated to myself completely. Honesdy. I'd rather fill my col- 
umn with personal enjoymcnL 

Have you ever had the best lime of your Ufe? Was ii 
something dial was just completely ridiculous? Take me, 

for example. 1 have a lot of memories. I've been to 

Woodstock. I've taken spring break trips. Memorable remember anything. Ever"

Friend, (frcnd) n.-a person

expand on itiis very shallow defini-

some degree in Communication, but 
also with three priceless friends who \ 
will always be inttebted to. The cama- 
raderie Ihal has been created through 
the years with Uiese guys knows no 
bounds. They Live been iherc for me 
through sevnal trying limes: ttie 20 -f 
page papers, German tests, committee 
meetings, diabetic and other health 
problems, financial challenges and 



being where so-called adults spread 
their rumors at&gt;out someone. You fmd 
oui who your friends are when trying 
umes occur and they ivere always 
dictc to give support and lend a help- 
ing hand. 

Friends are also people widi 
whom youstiare the greatcsl of times. 
The New Orleans trip, golf outings, 
chasing wild women (the pursuit of 
happiness or the happiness of pur- 
suit), ~siudy breaks" and conversa- 
tions widi these guys in (he G. PG. 
PG-13, R and XXX categories will 
always be remembered. Each day 
brings a new memory wi(h Ihese 
guys. These arc broad topics, but 
dierc is no one else in ilie world Uial I 



would want to share Ibe good limcx

Greg Sehamberg, Jason Rocbcl

being extretncly piediciable, is 
quile a romaniic notion for a slory-

his wife is still ahve because he can 
still feel her heart teating. Months
