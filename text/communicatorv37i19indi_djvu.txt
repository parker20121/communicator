Why are movie tans worldwide 
fascinated by actor Johnny Depp? Is 
there .mother layer beneath his look 
and film choices? 

On Tuesday, Jan. 30. Murray 
Pomerance. a professor and sociol- 
ogy department chair at Ryerson Uni- 
versity in Toronto, presented IPFW 
with probable answers, as well as 
ihnughl-provnkmg i|iiesiions, regard- 
ing the actor's life, loves and career 

Why is Johnny Depp so important 
to multinational culture? 

"He (Depp) is a chameleon per- 
petually hiding ... he borrows from 
his culture in a practiced and decisive 
way," said Pomerance at Tuesday 

The public is not just fascinated 
with Depp's celebrity status, but also 
with his deep connection with world 
culture. 

There are layers to Depp, and it is 
a combination o| deconstruct inn and 



amplification that the actor uses to 
keep critics and tans guessing. 

As an actor Depp rework his per- 
sona constantly in order to be reborn 

His own history must be erased

Pomerance calls "goofy unbclicv- 

In a society of consistently incon- 
sistent celebrities. Depp remains a 
common choice in the typical Amer- 
ican's theatrical diet b&gt; choosing 
roles (hat are systematically decon- 
te\ied, meaning that Ins movies arc- 
set in no specilic lime or place with 
an omnipresent or virtually unknown 
background - what Pomerance calls 

Invariably, there are no real plac- 
es in Depp's films and that, Pomer- 
ance says, is because he is aware that 
the films have no "expiration date" 
-- Ihey are stylistically plastic, and 
the sets and backgrounds do not de- 
tract from the real message of a given

Pomerance says that Depp 



ety and culture because there 
is cither "every flavor or no 
flavor" in his performances. 
Actors, as well as politicians, 
use this tactic in order to be 
universally appreciated. 

Pomerance uses Depp's 
character of Captain Jack 
Sparrow in "Pirates of the 
Caribbean" as an example. 

"Attempt to conjure a sin- 
gle controversial or distinctly 
memorable line of Sparrow's. 



It is not impossible, but high- 
ly improbable," said Pomer- 
ance. Il may detract from his 
universal appeal. 

"If a role is void of fla- 
vor." says Pomerance, "then 
it is universally acceptable 
and open to all audiences. 
Johnny Depp understands 
that, and thus, has a duality 

Though Depp is most rec- 
ognized for his performance 
in "Pirates," he expresses 
himself through more ob- 
scure roles, says Pomerance. 
Roles in "Sleepy Hollow" or 
"The Libertine" allow Depp 
to delve more deeply into the 
artistic and possibly more ar- 



cane side of acting, thus split- 
ling his career into two distinct 
fields. 

The 1PFW Department 
of Communications and the 
Chapman Fund sponsored 
Pomerance's lecture, which 
was facilitated by the Direc- 
tor of Graduate Studies Steven 
Can - and Professor Michael 
Stapleton. 

Carr asked Pomerance 
to come to IPFW. because 
"Depp's career is very telling. 
(Depp) is a deeper issue of 
media culture at this point in 
history. There's a need to talk 
about media image."

Smoking ban promotes a 
healthier city and citizens 



Lately, everyone has been in a 
huge fuss over this whole smoking 
ban lhai goes into effect on June 1st. 
I, for one, am all lor it. I am sick and 
tired, of having a great night out at 
the local bars, dancing, waiehing ka- 
raoke, or an amazing local hand, on l\ 
to come home smelling like a chim- 
ney! Come on people, mut smoking' 
Save your own life, and the lives of 
people around you. 

I do know, however, that when 
this ban takes effect, we will all wit- 
ness what I like to call "The Ket- 
tler Cloud" in various areas of Fort 
Wayne Tins is .1 cloud of smoke thai 
always surrounds the doors of Ket- 
tler, even though students are sup- 
posed 10 smoke in the huts or num- 
bered lots and whatnni. This is what 



: Fort Wayne a 

experience if ihey ban smoking Ironi 
bars, restaurants, and the like. Even 
though 1 am all for the ban on smok- 
ing in Fort Wayne, 1 am not for this. 

I am from California, born arid 
raised, and they have had nonsmok- 
ing bars for a while However, every 
bar has its own palio where anyone 
and everyone can go. hut it is the des- 
ignated area for smokers. 

I think this is a great idea that 
Fort Wayne should adopt, and then 
our bars and restaurants will have 
clean air for nonsmoking patrons to 
enjoy, and the smokers can srill have 
their fix in an area in which no one 
can bother them and they bother no 

Look, we aren't trying to take 
away your right to smoke or any- 
thing, but f don't want my right to 
breathe tresh air taken away from 
and being a nonsmoker 



doesn't impact I he air, llie environ- 
ment, or the public. 

Bar owners in Fort Wayne 
are in fear thai their revenues will de- 
crease because people cannot smoke 
in their bars Well, rest assured, 1 have 
a perfeei, closc-ln-homc example for 
you. Aside from California, since 
that may be a little far for some of 
you, there is a city that is actually in 
Indiana thai is already nonsmoking. 

Many people are surprised to 
find out that Bloomington bars are 
all nonsmoking. Being the big col- 
lege town dial il is. one would dunk 
the ban would greatly effect revenue 
since one of the biggesi demograph- 
ics of smokers is young adults. How- 
ever, each weekend there are packed 
bars in Bloomington. regardless of 
nonsmoking bars. 

I am really glad for this smoking 
ban in Fort Wayne, not only for my 
personal preferences, hut because I 



think thai with this ban more people- 
will stop smoking because it isn't as 
convenient. At the very least they'll 



I think that people who may be 
casual oc social smokers (terms I 
have never understood anyway) 
will stop smoking for lack of con- 
venience, and I think iliat the people 
who chain smoke will slow down 
because there would be no point in 
going to ,1 bar if you had to spend all 
your time outside smoking and nol 
inside having fun. 

Not only that, but I think if peo- 
ple stopped or cut back on smoking, 
people would generally be healthier 
not only because of the fresh air 
factor, but because cancer rales and 
deaths would decrease, and maybe 
our health iare iosis would go down.

play, I'm not going to. 

In fact, I've decided a 
play-by-play on commercials 
would be much more interest- 
ing and educational. More 
importantly, I will review 
the "Super Bowl commercial 
theory" and practicing prin- 
ciples that make a successful, 
marketable advertisement. 

Pain is a key element in 
television. Any form of suf- 
fering has the ability to trigger 
laughter. Spontaneity and rep- 
etition also play upon pain's 



power to persuade the mind. 
So when someone literally 
throws a rock during a game 
of Rock Paper Scissors, we 
can't help but chuckle. With 
this in mind, there isn't any- 
thing more satisfying than a 
good-sounding slap. The "fist 
bump" or "pound" is out, and 
the face slap is in. 

Since sex sells, we can all 
agree that Jim Gaftigan with 
a beard comb-over, women 
plus water, and Sheryl Crow's 
hair all attract the manly man 
demographic. 

Godaddy.com had a simple 
yet effective concept in at-

sit back and watch Piere's try to light 
the ban. Their general manager weni 

patrons from smoking, hut I think the

will add up after a while and make 
them change their minds, So while 
they say they're lighting for a good 
cause, and they will appeal this de- 
cision, they really aren't I guess Wc 
will see in the coming months wheth-

is for sure, if Fort Wayne establish'

Bad weather provokes pre-Spring Break lessons 



By Said EL-Dajani 
Managing Editor 

I'm officially tired of Ihis ex-

delays ili;it have no effect on college 
sludents, and ihe layers of clothing 
through which I end up profusely 
sweating. 

I know I'm nol alone lo think thai 
our frowns need to be turned upside- 
down and that Spring Break arrive 
immediately. Fortunately, we have 
a little less ih.in .•(! days lo eel huff. 
lose weight, and maybe tan for the 
perfect pre-vaeation look. 



But is this look necessary? 

Absolutely. There is nothing 
more important in my life than to 
stretch my superficial limits for 10 
days of pick-up attempts, alcohol 
consumption and bad karma collect-' 
ing. 

Why do we tan? 

Apparently, if we tan before we 
go on vacation, we won't bum as 
much: hence, the initial tan is en- 
haneed. fins, my friends, is a wise 
man's talc. We tan to pretend like 
we're going somewhere, so that 
when all our friends come back 
from Florida, we can all look tan ... 



Why do we work out right belore 
Spring Break? 

Sardines in a can wouldn't be the 
same if they weren't almost stuck 

together This is the same feeling we 
all have attempting to work out the 
month before Spring Break. The phe- 
nomenon is caused h&gt; a posilhe shift 
in our cognition to follow the social 
norm. I h.mk go,nlnc-s jumping of I -,&lt;

Finally, why do all professors as-

The answer is simple. They are 

trying to save us from the trap they

Stupidity is all Spring Break has 
become. Luckily, this is Indiana and 
we naturally have nothing to look

that comes along much sweeter and 
more enjoyable Until then, enjoy the

Letter 
to Oscar 
conveys 
concern 



By Tiffany Dirig 



This week's 



i: The Oscars 



I know thai ofien times -okay, 
almost every time — this little column 
is vapid and senseless. Yes, I may 
whine and throw tantrums about ihc 
social injustices in the world once in 
awhile (in print, al least). But. after 
looking at my lasl few articles, it be- 
came glaringly apparent that I spend 
an exorbitant amount of energ\ pitch- 
ing fits about crap lhal is ultimately 
meaningless, which allowed me lo 
come 10 a very critical realization: 
I'm glad! 

So much of the opinion section 
of any newspaper is chock-full of 
heated arguments about this or lhal 
policy. (Don't gel me wrong, the se- 
mester is young. I'm sure I'll bust a 
few more of ihose out.) Every now 
.Hid again, isn't it good to read some- 
thing mindless? 

With that said. let me tell you 
about the Oscars. I love the Os- 
cars. 1 always have and 1 always 
will. We've laughed, we've cried 
and we've grown up together. Sure, 
we've had our lights, but year after 
year, we always manage to forgive 
and fall in love all over again. How- 
ever, it's time that 1 get something 
off of my chest. So, I will address 
the rest of this direcily lo you, Os- 
car—for it is you that has succeeded 
in breaking my heart once more. 

My Dearest Oscar, 

As the New Year dawned, I got 
lhal warm, gooey feeling in my belly 
lhal 1 always have when I know our 
time together is drawing near. Then, 
that fateful day comes when I learn 
definitively of your arrival. This year 
was no different. I was as giddy as a 
schoolgirl with her first crush when I 
heard (fiat you'd decided to speak to 

After our fight last year over 
Three 6 Mafia- I'm still sore about 
that, by the way (did you honestly 
believe that they were award-wor- 
thy?)—! was sure that you wouldn't 
forsake me. I'd convinced myself 
that you would just inherently know 
how much you had disappointed me 
and that you'd do everything in your 
power to correct such a grievous er- 
ror. I see now that you have not. Ap- 
parently, my pain means nothing lo 
you. Apparently, I mean nothing to 

I don'l even know where to begin 
with the decisions you've made this 
year, young man. They were care- 
less and incredibly thoughtless. I 
mean. Meryl Streep for Best 

Actress? Did you nol see "The Devil 
Wears Prada" ' And where was Steve 
Carell's nod? He was the best part of 
"Little Miss Sunshine." 

Oscar, have you no self-respect'' 
I'll give you points lor your decision 
lo throw -The Black Dahlia," an oth- 
erwise horrible movie, a little love 
with Besi Cinematography. Howev- 
er, on the whole, you did poorly this 
year. Your one moment of redemp- 
tion was your choice to give Martin 
Scorsese a nomination, but we 
both know lhal was because of a 
year-long guilt-trip. To truly make 
up, Oscar, you'd belter actually give 
Mr. Scorsese bis award, along with 
a band -written letter of apology for 
scorning him last year. 

Hopefully, you've thought about 
what you've done and. by February 
25, you'll be able to show your re- 
morse. If not, I'll walk away from 
you with a heavy heart and my head 
hung low, for another 364 days. 
Please, don't lei me down. 



We'll see at the end of the month 
if Oscar heeds my advice. I hope 

he opts io slaw, -unie characier ihi-

Since 2001. the Decembcrisl 
have been hard at work honing 



that 






sii.mgc epic hriis 2IH)fi saw ihc re- 
lease of '"ITic Crane Wife," and also 
the band's first appearance on a major 
label (Capital Records). 

."The Crane Wife" boasts some of 
the band's most accessible material 
; wrong, this 



Mspa. 



.Htl 



Deccmbcnsts. this record is an excel- 
lent place to start- The band currently 
consists of Colin Meloy (vocals, 
guitar). Chris Funk (Guitar), Jenny 
Conlee (organ). John Moen (drum-.) 
and Nate Query (bass). This is only 
an approximation ol the instruments, 
because each member is a multi-in- 
strumental isi playing whatever is 
needed. 

Their style is like a cross between 
Deatheah for Cuiie. a very mellow 
Muse and lopped off with something 
one might hear on a pirate ship. It's 
odd at times, but the truth is that it 
works and it works well. 

Upon first listening to "The Crane 
Wife," I have to admit I was unsure of 
my thoughts. The instrumentation is 
simple and lacks energy. When 1 hear 
Meloy 's voice, 1 envision someone 1 
might call to show me how to play 
an online videogame (no offense, on- 
line gamers). 

This lack of excitement was fully 
intentional. The Dccembcrists let 
Iheir highs he high and their lows he 
low. and they know how to work in 
between. Track two is a 12-and-a-half 
minute epic that nrcelv demonstrates 
this fact. 

Once you catch the band's vibe, 
Meloy 's voice becomes curiously ap- 
propriate. After listening to the whole 
record, I can imagine no other voice 
I'm convinced this happens when a 
band is honest enough to focus on 
only what they do well. 

This honesty is present ihrough- 
out the whole package, ami il makes 
the album sound fresh. It becomes 
exciting in what it doesn't try to do 
as opposed to hemg overly eoinpli- 

The musical soundseapes created

These people are worth) of their po- 

I have heard it said that tins album 
is slightly more accessible than much 
ol The Dccembcrists' older material. 
I am looking forward lo seeing some 
of the strange places this band has 
been before "The Crane Wife" has 
converted yet another fan.
