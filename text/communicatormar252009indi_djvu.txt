Roundtable allows 

students to address 

food service concerns, 

suggestions 

By Katy Anderson 

katy.andettDn@ipfwcommtinkatar.arg 



A common complaint among students is the lack 
of variety in food services offered at IPFW. The food 
and beverage choices a student has on campus ace 
Subway, Pizza Hut. Taco Bell, and Higher Grounds. In 
a survey conducted on the IPFW campus, 72 percent 
of students surveyed said they would like to see more 
food options on campus. 

A food service roundtable discussion was held on 
Monday for students to voice their opinions about 
the current and future food services at IPFW. Ap- 
proximately 30 people were in attendance, and came 
to the consensus that food services at IPFW need to 
be healthier, have more variety, open at more conve- 
nient times, be affordable for students, have better 
service, and be more efficient. Suggestions from stu- 
dents included opening a convenience store on cam- 
pus, opening more restaurants or having more inde- 
pendent vendors, opening a buffet or salad bar, or 
having more vending machines with more options. 

Though this discussion did not establish any con- 
crete plans to improve food service, two vice chancel- 
lors were in attendance and Vice President of Finan- 
cial Affairs Walt Branson said that there is to be retail 
development near the childcare center of IPFW.

student government elections

Vote 



By Said El-Dajani 

Edilor-in-Chief 



There is more to student government than the apparent youthful 
candidate. The misconception may be that these young adults are 
faced with menial challenges such as restocking the coffee creamer I con- 
veniently have access lo. Call it conflict of interest if you must, but these 
students care, some, even for the newspaper you are reading. 

The truth is, some students on this campus do care. Whether it be for 
self-interest, the welUbeing of student life on campus or an audacious 
concern for community, these candidates have a vision for their futures 
and the microcosm we call IPFW. 

We have a responsibility this spring. Four of the these candidates will 
be elected into senior positions; representatives of IPFW; student govern- 
ment officials. This is not monopoly - they play with real money. 

This academic year's budget. tickles at around SI. 000.000. The student 
travel fund alone hovers at 5100,000. IPFW students and faculty have ac- 
cess to a $60,000 beautificntion fund. This publication respectfully accepts 
a substantial amount each year. 

Bottom line aside, these students are responsible for gauging the ei 
pus. They address student life concerns, plan and execute large scaled 
events, and legislate on issues relevant to administrators. 

I could direct you to a web site, which would do as much as choosing a 
candidate based bn these photographs. 

However, over the course of this election, 77ie Com municator will ded- 
icate a portion of every issue to some aspect of this election. We believe it 
is our responsibility to relay as much information pertinent to our readers, 
n Indiana.- Purdue Student Government Association (1PSGA) proponent.

OKAY. NEW JOKE. 
KNOCK KNOCK! 




IP5GA Candidates Agree 

Student inactivity main issue on campus 



By Kim Coffey 

Kim.Coffey@ipfwcammuniutor.org 

With student senate elections 
coming up, many candidates 
have been faced with the never- 
ending question, "what are the 
issues?" One favored response 
among this year's IPSGA candi- 



dates was student inactivity. 

Over 60 percent of the student 
community lives 20 minutes 
or less from campus. With that 
statistic, one would think that 
more students would be hang- 
ing around campus, but what 
do they have to stick around 
for? There are only a few weeks 



out of the school years reserved 
for ongoing activities, such as 
the "Welcome Back" week and 
Homecoming. Even then, only 
30 percent of campus feels in- 
formed about these events. Be- 
yond that, only 24 percent par- 
ticipate. 

Where does student inactivity 



arise from? Could it be chance 
that IPFW does not host enough 
events to keep the student body 
interested? It could also be that 
the students themselves would 
rather spend their time at home 
doing their own extracurricu- 
lar activities than seeing what is 
happening on campus. 



What do they want to do for you? 



Student Body President 

DeAngelo Lavelle thinks the number of people living on campus will increase 
dramatically, and that more round table discussions should be taking place to 
make students more aware and have a voice in these changes. "I'm here to serve 
and to cater to the needs of the students," Lavette said. 

Ajay Mahay wants to facilitate more communication between Students and 
their advisors so that students are more focused in the academic 
endeavors. "Tell me and I'll fix it," Mahay-said. 

Amanda Marks wants to heighten student involvement and awareness on 
campus by havng new activities and having more roundtable discussions. 
"It's all about you [the student body!," Marks said. 

Ronald Ramsey would like to see senators Communicating more with students 
on an individual basis, and also believes that establishing a subset of student 
government in Kettler Hall would make students more engaged because it tends 
to be one of the busier buildings on the IPFW campus. 

Allison Westropp hopes that she can serve as a student president to ensure 

that other students are more aware of events going on campus. 

"Get involved. The campus is still young, and make sure your voice is heard." 

Vice President of Legislation 

Andrew Stackhouse said that if elected, he would "reach out to student organi- 
zations and help them realize what IPSGA can do for them." 

Kody Tunnel, the current Student Body President. He hopes to recruit more stu- 
dents to participate in die Student Senate and try to change the proportion in Don't forget to vote the week of April 13. For more information on the 
which academic groups are represented. "The student senate can be and should candidates and the upcoming elections, visit www.Ipfw.edu/stiiBOv/. 
be very influential." 



Vice President of 
Student Programming 

Niki t a' Mathews has been an SAB member for three years. She hopes to expand 
activities on campus to incorporate a broader range of students. 

Mickey Smith hopes to use his education he has obtained at IPFW to make 
long-lasting difference and record everything that is done within student 
government. 

Nicole Walker has had several years of programming experience from being in- 
volved at her church. She hopes to bring people to bring direction and make 
students aware of what is available to them. "People don't care how much you 
care until they see how much you care." 

Vice President of Finance 

Melissa Cornish is currendy the Student Body Vice President of Legislation. She 
is also experienced in finance, as she has served on two different allocation 
committees. 

Erik Shepherd is the incumbent Vice President of Finance, and said that he 
helped develop A more standard and efficient way for students and faculty to 
make suggestions to student government. "The campus is becoming more ac- 
tive, and student government plays a huge role in that."

Letter to the Editor A Response to 'Dane Fine, 

Coach Fife's Record Short 



I would like to respectfully disagree with Sports 
Editor Dan Vance's piece where he rated basketball 
Coach Dane Fife's overall performance at a B level. 

As a student who attends many of the mens' 
team's games, I would have to say that you only need 
to look at the results of Coach Fife's won-loss record 
to come up with a pretty accurate assessment of how 
the team is progressing. 

The facts arc that over the last three years, there 
has been a plateau with virtually no forward move- 
ment occurring. The fact that perhaps one or two 
games a year, the IPFW team is able to compete with 



a Big Ten team like Michigan State lor most of the 
game means relatively little. 

In the recruitment area, which is where Division 
1 teams must be competitive. Coach Fife's record 
(as Dan Vance pointed out) is little short of abysmal. 
In Indiana, where Coach Fife should be able to com- 
pete to get at least consideration due to his connec- 
tion to IU and Coach Knight, nothing seems to be 
happening. 

The final thing that should be considered is that 
Coach Fife has had four years to improve IPFW's team 
and this year a team {North Dakota State U.,which 



Making the Grade' 

of Absymal 

was in its first year as a full Division 1 member) won 

the Summit League championship and went to the 

NCAA tournament. 

If the NDSU team and coaches could do it in 

their first full year in the conference, why are we 

hearing nothing but excuses from our coach and 

"maybe next year"s. 

I really think it is time for Coach Fife to resign and 

let someone else try to take this program to a higher 

level.

Building a Habitat for Humanity House o P Ed 



By Kelly McLendon 

kelly-mdendon@ipfvvcommunicatar.org 



The alarm clock in my bedroom buzzes loudly, 
waking me from just a few hours of sleep. As I hazily 
get out of bed and walk over to turn it off. 1 see the 
illuminated time: 6:00 a.m. I'm not used to being up 
this early. I quickly get dressed, have breakfast and 
I'm on my way to the Habitat for Humanity building 
site. 

When I arrive, the site is all unfamiliar. I have no 
building knowledge or skill, except an interest to 
learn what it's all about. Feeling out of place in my 
Converse sneakers, I notice the experienced builders 
are wearing durable work boots. The building site is 
nothing, yet. There is just concrete for the foundation 
and lots of mud. 

The other volunteer workers are just as diverse - a 



majority are men in their fifties and sixties, but there 
are younger people from local colleges. Before the 
building starts, the volunteers are called together to 
pray, and talk about what's going to happen. One of 
the first messages the leader wants everyone to know 
is that it is okay to ask questions. After all, he says the 
Habitat for Humanity build program is a learning ex- 
perience. 

Then, the men in charge tell the eager volunteers 
where to go. I'm sent to unload building materials 
from a truck — something that requires strength and 
agility, two characteristics I didn't think I had. After I 
step in a giant heap of mud while trying to unload the 
truck, I finally feel like waking up early wasn't a waste 
after all. This is fun. 

Feeling arrogant that everything was working out, 
I was sent to do a more difficult task: putting together 
window frames. This includes nailing pieces of wood 
together, which was more challenging than it should 



have been for me. 

One of the men who work on the build sites regu- 
larly was around to help me out. I thought he would 
yell at me for having awful construction skills. In- 
stead, he patiendy told me what I could do to fix it 
and waited while I messed up a few times. The Habi- 
tat for Humanity program doesn't care if you don't 
know a hammer from a nail — they're willing to help 
you out. 

After three hours of construction, which included 
helping put up four walls, window frames and door 
frames, finally there is a break for lunch. Everyone 
disperses and gets in line to pick up their free Habitat 
lunch. As the volunteers find places to sit around the 
open walls of the house, there is a moment for reflec- 
tion. The day seems important. People from all walks 
of life in the community, coming together, making a 
difference for somebody else.

ha n a . h a wash® i pfwf 





uncomfortable distance and I text too much.. 

Q. I feel like the guy that I like is dat- 
ing another girl because she is more 
convenient than me.. .she lives closer 
and has more time to spend with him 
than I do. What should I do? I want 
this guy to like me but I do not want 
to seem desperate or clingy. When do 
you know when you are calling or tex- 
ting him too much? 

A. It is up to you to decide what kind 
of a person this guy is. Does he like 
you enough to have a long distance 
relationship? If he likes you then dis- 
tance should not be an issue. It will be 
hard and get in the way most of the 
time, but in the end if you are meant 
to be together, it will happen. 

If. however, he has not spoken up, 
maybe you should. Some of us, myself 

inlcuded, believe in the man making the first move. But here's the thing: some 
guys are just too shy. If you like him and believe that you could be happy to- 
gether, for goodness sake, girl, go on and tell him. Like everyone says, what is 
the worst that could happen? You could get shot down, sure, but at least you do 
not have to keep wondering for however many years to come whether he liked 
you or not. 

As for texting or calling too much, it is pretty widely known that guys do 
not dig being pressured or nagged. Texting a lot can sometimes feel like nag- 
ging and pushes a males buttons. I know a lot of males that do not even like 
texting and would really rather to get a call from you. Plus, texting can be a bit 
impersonal and if you are trying to convey the message of liking a guy then 
calling him can show that more. Letting him hear your voice and the concern 
or excitement is a great way to let him know you are....well, excited to talk to 
die ma.n. 

Trust me, if a guy wants to talk to you, he will talk to you, even if he is shy. He 
may not ask you to be his girl, but there will be hints. So good luck my friend - 
be strong and do what you need to do. If you are reading this, you are probably 
in college, so focus on what you are really here for and do not worry so much 
about the guy., .it will happen.

Musician Entertains at Rhinehart 

John Tesh

Hundreds of fans both 
young and old, came ou! 
to IPFW's Rhinehart Mu- 
sic Center last Wednes- 
day, Mar. 18 to enjoy the 
music and musings of 
John Tesh. 

Accompanied by gui- 
tarists, a vocalist and light 
effects, Tesh played the 
piano, keyboard and sang. 
The best part of the show 
was when the hip hop 
dance instructor of Tesh's 
daughter came onstage 
to present his popping 
talent. If you can imag- 
ine someone popping 
to Christian Rock, I con- 
gratulate you on having 



a wonderful imagination, 
though this was the great- 
est part of the show. 

Tesh is not only an ac- 
complished musician, 
but is aJso the author of a 
book and host of a radio 
talk show entitled Intelli- 
gence For Your Life Radio: 
With Your Host John Tesh. 
in the talk show, Tesh gives 
inspirational and effec- 
tive advice that helps any- 
one of any age with their 
day-to-day lives. A staff 
of 1 full-time researchers 
are always digging up the 
most useful and practi- 
cal life skills and habits to 
share with the Tesh radio 
show listeners. 

Along with the radio 
talk show, Tesh is die au- 



thor of a book entitled 
Intelligence For Life. In 
this book, Tesh uplifts 
and inspires readers to 
find the deepest desires of 
their hearts, create a plan 
for pursuing their dreams, 
overcome crippling fears 
and inspire those around 
them." according to Tesh's 
website. 

With over 25 years of 
career experience, 10 of 
them being the co-host 
of the widely known tab- 
loid entertainment show 
Entertainment Tonight. It 
was an enormous shock 
when Tesh left this recog- 
nized position to pursue 
his music career. 

Tesh began his career 
with his first performance 
on PBS called Live At Red 
Rocks, which was hugely 
successful and alotted 
a large number of fans 
for future concerts and 
shows. He has released 
music that is still on the 
Billboard Pop and Chris- 
tian Music charts. 

The music is meant to 
inspire and relax and it 
did. The slow piano tunes 
put some to sleep, while 
the upbeat notes had oth- 
ers clapping and ready 
for more. To learn more

Roommate's Pick 

Kings of Convenience 



By Mark Cox 



Kings of Convenience 
is an indie folk-pop duo 
from Bergen, Norway. 
Both Eirik Glambek Boe 
and Friend Oye sing and 
compose the 
band's songs 
and use their 
soothing tunes 
and subtle 
guitar melo- 
dies to capture 
their audience. 
The two have 
known each 
other since 
they were 10 
years old and 
have played 
in bands since 
they were 16. 
Their first 

band, Skog 
("forest" in 
Norwegian) 
was put to- 
gether by the 
duo along with 
two or their friends, 
releasing only one El' 
record, lam Tids Tale. 

before breaking up and 
forming Kings of Conve- 
nience In 1999. 



After being heard in 
European music festivals, 
American record label 
Kindercore signed them 
and they released their 
debut album, Quiet is the 
New Loud, which was pro- 
duced by Coldplay's pro- 
ducer, Ken Nelson. The al- 




bum was very successful. 
Falling off thegridline, not 
much was heard from the 
hand and Oye spent a few 
years in Berlin doing solo 
material. Their follow-up 



album finally emerged 
in 2004 with Riot on an 
Empty Street. 

I did not like them 
during my first listen, 
but the (racks began to 
grow on me. Remind- 
ing me of a slower and 
mellower lack Johnson, 
dieir Norwe- 
gian talent 
will either be 
inspiring or 
put you to 
sleep. Some 
of my favor- 
ite tracks are 
Gold in the 
Air of Sum- 
mer, Envoy, 
and Summer 
on the West 
Hill. 

After 
some small 
tours in Nor- 
way during 
the autumn 
and winter 
months, the 
two are ready 
to sit down 
and start recording their 
next album, which they 
hope will be done by 
April, but are skeptical 
about hitting their an- 
ticipated deadline. 




Local Metal Band Wins Big /

The origin of humanity 
and the relationship it has 
with the world around it 
has been explored ever 
since it has been able to 
ask itself the infamous 
question "why?" It has 
been asked in laborato- 
ries, text books, novels, 
atop ancient burial sites 
and upon the stage. 

Exploring the human 
condition and how it has 
evolved physically, spiri- 
tually and intellectually 
over the ages is a staple 
of a liberal arts education. 
This examination drives 
Annie Robinson to delve 
deeper into the study of 
anthropology theatre. 

As a freshman at IPFW, 
Robinson is justbeginning 
to learn the techniques 
that it takes to participate 
in the in-depth explora- 
tion of mankind. She is 
studying two exceedingly 
diverse methods leading 
to similar ends. 



As a thespian, she in- 
terprets a character bom 
(torn the mind of man. 

This process gives in- 
sight on her own human- 
ity, as well as the world 
created by the playwright, 
which is, after all, rooted 
in the world of that artist. 
As an Anthropology ma- 
jor, Robinson studies the 
culture, both material 
and immaterial, of hu- 
man beings, both living 
and dead. The two disci- 
plines complement each 
other well, giving greater 
insight into what it means 
to be human. 

Although her main 
focus is not centered on 
theatre, Robinson has 
begun to make a name 
for herself in the theatri- 
cal community. Her lat- 
est performances include 
"How to Succeed in Busi- 
ness Without Really Try- 
ing" at IPFW and "Fran- 
kenstein: A New Musical" 
at the Civic Theatre. "1 
don't want to be like my 
characters in How to and 
Frankenstein, caught in 
my own little world," said 



Robinson. "I want to dis- 
cover new ways of living 
and understand the world 
better. That's why anthro- 
pology is so interesting to 
me. There's always a new 
way to look at life." 

Even though her roles 
in the two plays were 
chorus parts, they both 
made power statements 
about human nature, 
"They both see a need 
for a natural social order 
in their world. Anything 
out of the ordinary must 
be squashed," said Rob- 
inson. 

Robinson doesn't know 
where these pursuits will 
lead her after gradua- 
tion, but that doesn't mat- 
ter at this juncture in her 
life. "1 really have no idea 
where I'll go after college. 
I would like to travel a lot. 
study different cultures. I 
may decide to go to grad 
school, it just all depends 
on where I am in life. I'm 
not a '5 year plan' kind of 
person. If an opportunity 
comes along, I take it. I try 
and live in the moment as

Mastodons ousted in the East 

■ Defending champs Penn State dominate; St. Francis (PA) avenges early season loss 



Coach Arnie Ball ihrew 
everything he had at St. Francis 
(PA) to stop the slide, but it just 
wasn't enough. 

The Mastodon volleyball team 
lost their fourth straight match 
Saturday after collapsing from a 
strong start to fall 3-2 (31-29, 30- 
24, 27-30, 18-30, 7-15) to the host 
Red Flash. The win for the Flash 
was revenge for an earlier season 
3-0 pounding at the Gates Center 
by IPFW (9-9). ' 

. Continuing to see more playing 
time after a finger injury, junior 
setter Corey Stewart paced the 
Mastodons well early and put up 
42 assists throughout the night. 
It was Stewart as well that helped 
end game one with a timely kill. 

That kill came after the Red 
Flash rallied to tie the game at 27 
but freshman Jonathan Meyer 
served an ace to help give IPFW 
momentum. 

In game two, tied at 14, junior 
Ben Duckworth put down one of 
his match high four service aces. 

Duckworth came into the 
weekend leading the nation in 
service aces per game at 0.67 and 
was third nationally in total service 
aces with 35. 

IPFW as a team had nine aces 
in the St. Francis loss, including 
three by Oliver Kook. 

Despite a .467 hitting 
percentage in the second game by 



the Mastodons, St. Francis came 
out firing in the third. Despite 
playing back and forth early, a 
Jordan Varee kill gave the Red 
Flash an advantage at 13-12 and 
never looked back, putting IPFW 
down by as many as seven points 
mid-game. 

Game four was all St. Francis 
as they never trailed and led by as 
many as 12 points. 

In game five, the Mastodons 
never quite Found their footing 
and went down 5-1 on a bad set, by 
Dan Mader. IPFW pulled the game 
to 9-6 but the Varee serve led to 
the next five points on an ace, two 
IPFW attack errors and two kills by 
Nick Rivett for the Flash. 

Darryl Shank led IPFW with 
20 kills while Kook and Nathaniel 
berg each added 1 1 . The Red Flash 
were led by Varee's 25 kills while 
Rivett added 20. 

It was IPFW's third five-game 
match this season and first loss

Tennis nets conference wins 



There is the age-old saying that 
"what happens in Vegas, stays in 
Vegas." 

Coach Eric Bums is probably 
hoping for the opposite and that his 
Summit League leading women's 
tennis program takes what they did in 
Las Vegas this past weekend and apply 
it during the rest of the spring season. 

The Masotodons made the trip 
West for a three day conference opener 
against fourdifFerent opponents, taking 
out all Four to improve to 18-3 on the 
season (4-0 in conference).

way on day one with three total wins,

topping Courtny Myers 6-0, 6-1 at 
number one singles. 

Also on the first day of play, the 
Mastodons topped preason conference 
favorite Oral Roberts, 4-2. Recht won 
again in the top singles spot, 6-1, 6-0 
over ORU's Hayden Rush. Ingrid Ballus, 
the reigning Summit League Player of 
the Week, was also 2-0 on the first day 
for IPFW and topped ORU's Rafaela 
souza 6-2, 2-6, 6-4. Yuka Kobayashi 
and Alexandra Forsyth also notched 
singles victories overtheGolden Eagles. 
Forsyth later teamed with Kate Brien to 
take a win at number three doubles. 

On Friday, the team stayed perfect 
in conference play with a 4-0 victory 
over Oakland. Recht, Ballus and Sachi 
Janek dominated in singles with IPFW 
picking up wins as well in doubles play 
by the teams oF Ballus/ Kobayashi and

The Mastodons finished their 
dominant weekend on Saturday with a 
4-3 edging of Southern Utah.

Coming off a home win on 
Wednesday, the baseball team traveled 
to Ann Arbor over the weekend for 
three games with a usually strong 
Michigan program. Falling in all three 
games. 

The first loss came Friday thinks 
to a Alan Oaks homerun to lead off the 
fourth inning. With the game tied at 2- 
2, Oaks (batting . 1 42 coming in) hit the 
hall off Samuel Walker over the right 
field fence. The Wolverines finished 
the game with a 4-2 after a Kevin Cislo 
sixth inning RBI. 

Mastodon Chris Gottschall was 3- 
of-5 in the game with an RBI. 

On Saturday, the Wolverines again 
took the win, 4- 1 , scoring ail four runs 
in the first two innings. 

The Michigan first was on the board 
earlier with three first inning wins, 
partially thanks to a Mike Dufek two- 
run homer off IPFW starting pitcher 



Stacy Herrold. Michigan also scored 
on a first inning sacrifice fly and a 
suicide squeeze by shortstop Anthony 
Toth in the second inning. 

All of the scoring was done after 
the second inning with Michigan's 
Eric Katzmah striking out 10 while 
Herrold put down five in eight innings 
of work. 

On Sunday, the Michigan bats got 
hot again, putting up four earned runs 
on nine hits off IPFW's Tyler Baatz in 
route to a 9-2 win. 

IPFW kept the game within a run 
until a thrpe-run Wolverine sixth, led 
by a Kenny Fellows double and John 
Lorenz homerun. Michigan added 
three more,runs in the 8th with a pair 
of RBI from Fellows. 

IPFW left 13 runners on base 
throughout the game, including three 
in the first inning. Three Mastodons 
each had two hits.

Pierce makes home debut 
with win over Rockets 



-season 

Hi;; Gottschall ■ 11 
Runs: Gottschall - 14 
Doubles: Gottschall- 1 
R8I: Gottschall -15 
ERA:Walker-3.18 



By Dan Vance 

dan.vance@iprwcommunlcalDr.org 

Before a single out was recorded on the 
scoreboard in last Wednesday's baseball home 
opener, the visiting Toledo Rockets had already 
hung three runs on the shell shocked Mastodons on 
only one hit. 

And in that, Coach Bobby Pierce learned what 
two walks, two hit batters and a crushing error by the 
team's offensive leader would do to start a game. 

Luckily for the first year coach, Chris Gottschall 
would make up for that error 
later with two hits, two runs 
and a big RBI to help the 
Mastodons to an 8-3 win. 

"Being down 3-0 in the 
first inning, you just want to 
show well in front of the home 
crowd," Pierce said. 

Things didn't always seem 
as solid for the Mastodons on offense. A first inning 
Gottschall single was the only hit in the first three 
innings. Of the nine other batters who stepped to 
the plate for 1PFW, eight of them struck out. 

"The big thing for us is we just want to kind of 
slow the game down pitch by pitch," Pierce said. 

The Mastodons finally broke through in thefourth 
as the temperatures began to drop and forecasted 
rainfall moved into the area. 

Joel Washko led off the inning with a single, that 
Gottschall followed with a double - his second hit in 
as many at bats. The first run finally crossed the plate 
as first baseman sh.mii VanDriessche hit a sacrifice 
fly to score Washko. Mason Rovenstine added an 
RBI single before the inning was over to make the 
score3-2, still in favor of the Rockets. 

The Toledo defensive fifth started much like the 
Mastodons' first as a Jared Hoying error started the 
inning. 

From there, the Mastodons went wild off of 
Toledo mistakes, scoring five times on just two hits. 

Even a mid-inning pitching change didn't work 
out for the Rockets as freshman Lincoln Rassi hit 
VanDriessche, the first batter he faced. Mark Carden 
singled in Washko midway through the inning off 
RassL 

"We wanted to.force them to make plays and they 
didn't and we just kept pushing," Pierce said. 

The Mastodons picked up an insurance run in the

8th, scoring Jason Doerffler on a Gottschall walk. 

"That is what good teams do," Pierce said. "They 
aren't comfortable just winning by a run, they keep 
playing on." 

After a sluggish first inning, pitcher Josh Shatto 
came alive, giving up just two more hits in innings 
two through five before handing the game over to 
Scott Micinski. Shatto 's win was his first in Mastodon 
blue, including three strikeouts. Micinski pitched 
four innings and gave up no hits while striking out 
five on his way to the save. 

Pierce noted that he's seen that he can leave 
Shatto in through rough situations and still see him 
succeed. 

"His last two outings are scenerios where he's 
shown he's not going to get rattled emotionally," 
Pierce said. 

Gottschall finished the day 2-for-4 from the plate, 
including a double. The shortstop leads the team 
currently in hits, runs, RBI and doubles. Washko 
also had two hits on the day, but Rovenstine was the 
only multiple RBI man with two. 



Track competes in Early Bird Relays, prepares for split next week 



The IPFW Mastodons took 
third of nine teams at the 
Cincinnati Early Bird Relays 
on Saturday afternoon. Crystal 
M artinez, who earned All -Summit 
League honors during the indoor 
season in the 5,000-meter run, 
missed a school record by just 
over one second, taking the top 
time in the event. 

Martinez and Felicia Mondry, 
each took first in an event, with 
Mondry's coming in the 3,000- 
meter steeple chase. 

A relay meet is scored much 
differently than a normal meet, 
as a school's top two times in a 
running event, the top two marks 
in field events, are added together, 
and then, as a pairing, the best 
time or marks earn 10 points for 
the team for a first-place finish, 
eight for a second-place finish, 
andso-on. 

Complete relay scoring on 
individual events, however, was 
unavailable in the results. 

IPFW placed third overall 



with the special scoring, finishing 
with 64 points, three points 
ahead of Xavier, and ahead of 
Indianapolis (46). Robert Morris 
(43), Mt. St. Joseph (29), Miami 
(28), and Morehead State (9). 
Host Cincinnati took home the 
women's team tide with 165 
points, with Dayton finishing 
second with 132 team points. 

Mondry ran to a Lime of 
11:32.47 in the steeple chase, 
taking first overall, while Sarah 
Hutchings placed fourth in the 
field with a time of 11:46.31. 
Annina Gruber, also competing 
in the event, placed eighth with a 
time of 12:37.89. 

Martinez and Ali Paul took 
first and eighth in the 5,000-meter 
run, with Martinez running a 
time of 17:1 1.86 and Paul 18:12.78 
The duo of Whitney Lane and Jill 
Edmonds placed third and fourth, 
respectively, in the triple jump, 
Lane leaping to a distance of 10.51 
meters (34-feet, 5.75-inchesl, and 
Edmonds 10.00 (32-9.75). 



Edmonds and Lane also 
teamed up in the 200-meter run, 
Edmonds taking 14th in a time of 
28.28, and Lane 28.44, and in the 
long jump, where Lane took 20th 
with a leap of 4.55 meters (14- 
11.25), and Edmonds 21st in 4.54 
(14-10.75). 

Laura Williams was IPFW's 
super-competitor for the meet, 
as she took part in four separate 
field events, placing inside of the 
top-12ineach. 

Her top placing came in the 
javelin, where she finished in a 
lie for ninth with a toss of 28.92 
(94-10), with Jessica Miller, in 
her first meet on the track team 
after completing her eligibility on 
the volleyball squad, placed 14th 
in the event, tossing the spear a 
distance of 23.82 meters (78-1). 

The squads split next weekend , 
as members from the squads will 
be at both the Alabama Relays, 
and at the Stanford Invitational 
on Friday and Saturday, March 27 
and 28. 



Southern Utah 
strikes down IPFW 

■ Cronin pitches complete game shutout 
on day two to avoid sweep for IPFW

Last weekend the women's softball team traveled 
to Southern Utah for a match up against the 
Thunderbirds. With a split in the conference the week 
before, IPFW took a long exhausting week of pracdce 
and prepared for a knock down drag out battle. 
Starting on Friday with a double header, the evening 
didn't end well as the Lady Mastodons lost 8-0 and 
12-4. But, on the bright side, freshman Cassie Wolfe 
had a career day, hitting 3-for-4 with two homeruns 
and three RBI in game two. 

Picking up where they didn't leave off on Friday, 
IPFW came out Saturday to stir up some dust. 

"I think on Saturday we really came together as a 
team. We worked really hard in practice all week after 
being on the road, and we were all tired," explained 
sophomore catcher Kristina Karpun. 

Freshman Courtney Cronin pitched an IPFW 
shutout in seven innings to allow the 'Dons to end 
the series taking the win in one of the three games, 
5-0. 

"Courtney did a great job, but we also had some 
excellent defense, and our offence also came through 
for us. This coming weekend we will be playing 1UPUI 
and naturally we would like to win three games in a 
row, but we will be taking it one game at a time," said 
Coach Keith Fisher. 

The Lady 'Dons hope to see a large crowd for their 
first home games of the season. They take on IUPUI 
Friday at 3:00 and 5:00 and Saturday at noon.
