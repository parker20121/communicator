Senate OKs ad hoc committee 

Faculty to review 
ties to I.U., Purdue 



By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 
Editor-in-Chief 

The Fort Wayne Faculty Senate 
voted almost unanimously on Monday 
to establish a committee that would 
study iPFW's relationship with Indiana 
and Purdue universities. 

A proposal, authored by Steve 
Hollander, assistant professor of 
English, suggested that the 
nominations and elections committee of 
the faculty senate submit a slate of 
candidates to serve on an ad hoc 
committee Ihat would review the 
relationship. 

"This is the first time the senate has 
asked for any thoroughgoing analysis. 
It's some kind of milestone," Hollander 

This issue of the relationship between 
I.U., Purdue and IPFW is not a new 
one. The possibility of fPFW becoming 
independent from the two mother 
universities arises quite often, 
Hollander said. "It (this proposal) 
could have come up anytime in the last 
several years," he said. "What had 
been discussed in the hallways and In 
- the faculty lounge ...has just finally got 
on the floor of the senate." 

The concern over whether IPFW will 
get to otter its own M.B.A-, rather than 
a statewide one. and the ongoing 
negotiations about IPFW offering a 
computer science degree, are just a 
couple things that concern the faculty 
with the present relationship, 
Hollander said. 

Following are some of the matters 
that the seven-member committee will 
study : 

— selection, attraction, and retention 
of students, faculty and administrators 

— academic and nonacademic 
program development 

— employee compensation and 
benefit programs 

— fiscal and funding policies and 
procedures 

— academic transferability 

— flexibility in meeting regional 

^ governance 

— physical development 
Hollander said he would expect very 

in-deplh market research and student 
interviews to be just a part of the study. 
"There is very strong support for 
doing the study," Hollander said. He 
also said that independency might not 
be the answer to problems that exist. 
One of the alternatives mentioned was 
a redefinition of the whole relationship 



to get rid of impediments that have 
caused problems belwen the three 
campuses inthepasl. "There is a broad 
middle ground," Hollander said. "1 
le-an toward independence and that's no 
secret. It's quite possible that evidence 
producedby the study could change my 
mind." 

"People made it very clear that 
voting tor this resolution was not a vote 
for severing ties," Hollander said. 

The only faculty member dissenting 
was Richard Hess, associate professor 
of communication. Although Hess was 
unavailable for comment on Tuesday, 
he told the faculty senate on Monday 
that his vole was a vole against 
establishing another committee. He 
said IPFW already has Iwo standing 
committees lliat handle issues between 
IPFW, Purdue and I.U. 

Hollander said he would rather have 
an ad hoc committee study this issue 
because the members of the other two 
committees were not chosen to do this 
kind of research. He also said that 
studying the relationship IPFW has 
with Purdue and I.U. was not in their 
chargi" as a. committee. Hollander's 
proposal states that the seven-member 
commillee will consist of at least three 
senators of each university affiliation. 
He said the faculty he would support to 
be on the committee would be IPFW 
faculty who will "represent IPFW's 
best interests." 

Purdue University President Steven 
Beering was unavailable for comment 
on Tuesday. An assistant in his office 
said he woidd not be available until 
later in the week. Indiana University 
President John Ryan was nol available 
for comment either. However, Dan 
Orescanin, vice president for university 
relations at Blooming ton, said he hoped 
the IPFW faculty would constructively 
examine the relationship and make 
suggestions on how to improve the 
weaknesses that exist, IPFW Chan- 
ceUor Thomas Wallace was out of town 
on Tuesday and was unavailable for 
comment. 

Hollander said the committee's study 
could work in either a positive or 
negative manner depending on whether 
people saw it as sincere faculty interest 
in the future of IPFW or whether they 
saw it as a threat. 

"I would really hope they (university 
officials) would see it as a constructive 
step that would improve the relation- 
siiip among the three campuses," 
HoUander said. 



Rights to free speech, 
fair trial examined 

ByDEBHARMENING 
Copy Editor 

On Thursday, April 15, nineteen panelists gathered at IPFW for the Press Bar 
and the Constitution seminar. 

The panelists represented Fort Wayne and surrounding areas, not only in 
media, but also included a host of notable Fort Wayne attorneys, two judges, two 
IPFW professors and Reverend Margaret McCroy-Worral of Campus Ministry. 

Paul Helmke, a Fort Wayne attorney who is a candidate for the 1987 mayoral 
office, mediated the affair. 

A hypothetical ease was proposed by Helmke and different representatives on 
the panel were asked questions concerning the case and answered according to 
their given roles within the hypothetical situation. 

Interaclion among the panel members showed that the First Amendment 
guaranteeing the right to a free press is not mutually exclusive of the Sixth 
Amendment wtiich guarantees the right to a fair and public trial, 

"The basis of the whole exercise had its origin in the seeming conflict between 
the First and Sixth Amendment," Ernie Williams, coordinator of the IPFW 
journalism department said- 
Williams said the purpose of the panel was to "illuminate many of the problems 
of both the Bar and the press, the Constitutional safeguards provided the courts, 
the press, and most important, every American citiien." 

"Over a decade ago, the press and the Bar were locked in a bizarre battle which 
concerned and even frightened many thoughtful leaders" in both camps, Williams 
said, 

Williams said the tension today between the opposing parties has eased because 
each party is aware of the other's problems and concerns. He added Ihat people 
are realizing "you can have a tree press and at the same time have the Con- 
sfitution which provides a fair trial," 

According to Williams, one of the major problems during the 60's and 70's "was 
the feeling of the Bar that the press didn't give a damn." However, this attitude is 
' changing due to the realization that newspapers print material only after carefully 
arriving at conclusions, and not out of malicious intent.

Program heightens 
awareness of rape 



By JUDY RAMSEY 
Staff Writer 

Rape is a crime of violence which can 
happen to any woman. Learning how 
not to be a victim of rape, heightening 
awareness, and discussing the value of 
taking self-defense classes were topics 
covered during a Rape Awareness 
Program conducted at the IPFW 
Women's Center April 15. 

Karen Bojrab and Valerie Gater, 
counselors with the Fort Wayne 
Women's Bureau, and Cheryl Hen- 
derson, a two-year veteran with the 
University Police and Safety Depart- 
ment spoke at the program. 

Terry Worman, coordinator for the 
Women's Center, also hoped women 
would "realize they can come to the 
Women's Center and continue to talk 
about what was started in this 
program." 

"Over two-thirds of all rapes are by 
acquaintances," Bojrab said during her 
presentation. Rapists are categorized 
into three areas. The anger rapist 
tieats, cuts, and abuses the victim. The 
power rapist, the most common type, 
threatens the victim with a weapon but 
never actually uses il; and the sadistic 
rapist mutilates and kilts the victim. 

Bojrab said 58 percent of all rapes 
occur in tite victim's home with the 
automobile and the rapist's own home 
considered the next likely places for 
rape attacks. 

Bojrab offered the following 
suggesfions to lower thechancesof date 
rape: set hmits beforehand with clear 
messages; everyone has the right to 
say "no." Exercise this right; when 
dating a new acquaintance, double or 
group-date; avoid rides with strangers; 



be aware ot the affects you are having 
on another person: don't have sex with 
someone because you feel you owe it to 
him or you feel you have to; always 
trust your instincts; and remember, 
you are most vulnerable when under 
the infiuence of drugs and alcohol. 

The University Police and Safety 
Department continuously patrols the 
campus grounds, Henderson spoke of 
the escort service which the depart- 
ment provides for the campus com- 
munity. This service is for anyone 
needing an escort to the parking lot and 
operates twenly-four hours a day, 
seven days a week. 

Henderson also mentioned the 
possibility of telephones being installed 
throughout the parking lots on campus 
in the future. These telephones would 
\x connected directly to the university 
pohce department. Henderson con- 
cluded by emphasizing the importance 
of reporting all crimes and suspicious 
looking individuals to the police 
department. 

"One out of three women will be 
sexually assaulted in her life," Jeanne 
Harber Porter, director of the Rape 
Awareness Program at the Fort Wayne 
Women's Bureau, said, consequently 
women are encouraged to develop a 
conslanl awareness, to discover the 
different options available against 
attackers, and to learn more about the 

Porter outlined the following 
procedures tor anyone who has been 
sexually assaulted: 11 Call a counselor 
Uirough the Rape HoUine at 426- RAPE; 
2j gel medical attention; and 3) report 
the rape to the police. It is not 
necessary to prosecuteor to provide the

Faculty committee looks 
at IPFW independence 



Independence is an idea that seems to 
grow in strength as the semesters pass 
and problems grow at IPFW. 

Severing the sometimes-binding ties 
between IPFW and its founding in- 
stitutions, Purdue and I.U. is not, 
needless to say, a new idea. For years, 
faculty members have grumbled about 
the problems of working under the 
management of the two universities. The 
cries seemed to get even louder after 
Indiana State University at Evansville 
cut its ties and became independent. 

But the question still remains: What is 
best for IPFW? Some people at IPFW 
would contend that going independent 
would be best for Fort Wayne and IPFW 
for many reasons. Some say that an 
independent Fort Wayne university 
would be able to offer more programs 
that would better serve the region. 
Vocation programs, for example, could 
gel a boost. The problems that IPFW is 
experiencing right now in trying to get 
approval to offer its own M.B.A. 
program, rather than participate in a 
statewide program, is another example. 
Getting approval to offer programs like 
social work, physical therapy and 
radiology IS anoUier example. 

Fort Wayne businesses could possibly 
t&gt;enefit from an independent university, 
although more research would have to 
bedoneby the commit tee which the Fort 
Wayne Faculty Senate voted to enstate. 
One possible benefit for Fort Wayne 
businesses would be that educational 
offerings, like an M.B.A. , would more 
directly correlate with their needs. If a 
university in Fort Wayne had to rely 
more on local monetary support, it 
would be more likely to offer programs 
that would directly serve its con- 
stituents. 

Opponents would say that IPFW was 
founded to be a direct extension of the 
internationally known Purdue 
University and Indiana University. It is 
quite possible that those Fort Wayne 
citizens who were very strong sup- 
porters of establishing IPFW would turn 
their backs and refuse to support an 
independent university. Opponents 
might offer as a defense that receiving a 
degree from Fort Wayne State 
University would not tie an attractive 
alternative to receiving a degree from 
I.U. or Purdue. 



Questions do remain. Concerns 
remain also. Valid concerns, as a matter 
of fact. It is understandable when 
faculty get upset at Purdue officials 
when President Steven Beering says he 
would support an M.B.A. program at 
IPFW, but on the other hand, says he 
thinks it would be to IPFWs benefit, and 
he would support, IPFW participating in 
a statewide MBA program controlled 
by Indiana University. 

Researching the answers to the 
questions and trying to find solutions to 
calm concerns and to help strengthen 
weaknesses that do exist in the bond 
between IPFW, Purdue and I.U. is the 
charge of the committee that senate 
memt)er Steve Hollander proposed to be 
established. 

Right now it would be premature for 
faculty members, administrators here 
and at the main campuses, and Fort 
Wayne community members to get 
upset. Rather, they should look upon the 
proposal as a step toward improving the 
relationship between the three 
universities. Open communication is the 
only way problems can be resolved. 
They cannot be resolved by the 
faculty's grumbling. They cannot 
be solved by Fort Wayne community 
members pressuring university officials 
to act one way or another. The 
weaknesses in the bonds need to be 
confronted. Solutions have to be found. 
Whether the solution is to redefine the 
relationship IPFW has with the two 
main campuses; whether the solution is 
to completely sever the ties IPFW has 
with the two main campuses; or whether 
the solution is to leave things as they are, 
all involved should support the com- 
mittee's efforts and realize they are 
trying to improve IPFW. They should 
trust that the committee would take into 
consideration all factors involved: 
recruitment of students and faculty, 
fiscal and funding possibilities, 
academic program development, em- 
ployee compensation and benefit 
proceduresand governance. 

Finally they should trust that the 
committee would make proposals that 
would better enable IPFW to serve its 
consumers: thestudents. 

After all, we all know that an in- 
stitution that does nothing but serves 
itself, serves no one in particular. 




1— Letters to the Editor- 



Budget woes 

To Itie Editor: 

Pertiaps your readers 
ouid like an update on the 
budget crisis in the English 
and Linguisiics department 
The Communicator, March 
%). Thanks lo the resour- 
:erulness ot the deparl- 



ments faculty, teaching 
effectiveness will not be 
impaired. Many instructors 
have taken less expensive 
ways of communicating 
course materials to students, 
and a (ew have sought out 
alternative sources (or 
research support. Even a 
guardian angel or two has 
helped restock the dwindling 



paper supply 1 am proud of 
the faculty's positive, 
professional response to the 
shortfall of funds, 

Vour coverage of the 
department's fiscal woes is 
valuable because it informs 
— or reminds — members of 
this community that IPFW is 
an underfunded campus. For 



that reason I have no ob- 
jection to the publicity about 
the department's situation. I 
confess, however, to feeling 
ambushed by the quotation 
you chose to highlight. Aside 
from making me sound like 
an academic Marie- 
Antoinette ( "Let them 
deduct expenses!") by 
omitting the question which 



prompted my remark, this 
conspicuous quotatio 
distracts allcnlion from the 
general, much more im- 
portant problem: [PFWdoes 
not receive sufficient 
resources.

/.Policy intentions^ blurred 



Recently the Faculty Senate approved a 
policy thai would allow smoking in only the 
designated areas These areas have yet lo be 
determined, but the senate feels that smoking 
should not be allowed in offices, meeting 
rooms, classrooms, hallways, restrooms and 
laboralones Ashtrays will be removed from 
areas that are not designated smoking areas. 
Equipping designated smoking areas with 
separate ventilation has also been discus.sed 

Unfortunately this policy may not create a 
smoke-free environment for the students and 
staff of IPFW, The policy leaves far too many 
loopholes and unanswered questions to be 
effective 

First the policy clearly states the objective: 
a smoke free environment, but the Faculty 
Senate is wishy-washy in ttv? method of im- 
plemenlation. No smoking is lo be in the 
classrooms, restrooms. meeting rooms, 
hallways and laboratories The only place left 
to smoke is the lounges. This means thai the 
lounges will be packed with smokers, pushing 
out the non-smokers who wish lo watch 
television or gab with friends. 

Also the policy refers to implementing a 
separate ventilation system for the lounge 
areas This system will definitely t&gt;e needed 
lo keep second hand smoke from drilling lo 
non-dcsignated areas. However, how much 
will this system cost? Will non-smokers be 



paying part of their tuition to ensure that 
smokers keep their right to smoke? 

There is also the mailer of enforcement lo 
consider. It would be hoped thai smokers 
would only smoke in designated areas. 

This means that ttie campus police, or 
someone, will have to patrol non-smoking 
areas if this policy is to be enforced. This will 
take away valuable time that the campus 
police could be using to prevent car break-ins 
and rape. It has also l&gt;een suggested thai 
some buildings be entirely non-smoking 
buildings, like the animal care facility and 
Neff Hall, This seems like a good idea, but 
reasons could be found lo make all IPFW 
tniildings non-smoking 

Also if someone was caughl smoking in the 
boys' room, what would happen to this per- 
son? Would ihey be ticketed or fined'' It 
seems superfluous to initiate a policy if no 
moves are made to carry it out. 

It IS clear that IPFW needs a smoking 
policy, but ttiis isn't it. This policy is blurred 
to be seen clearly. The admiiuslration and 
senate should create a well slated no smoking 
policy thai covers every eventuality and can 
be understood by all. 

Making policy promises should be more 
than just words, A policy should be effective, 
cost-efficient and enforcable. It is time for the 
administration and faculty to stop making 
promises and start keeping Ihem.

This movie is one that (he

berth in the NCAA Final 
Four to be played at UCLA, 
May 1-2. 

Ball Slate, defending 
MIVA champion Ohio Stale 
and host IPFW all bring 
impressive credentials into 
the tourney. 

Ball State, ranked fifth in 
the nation, is 22-12 on the 
season and wrapped up the 
bye into the finals by virtue 
of an 6-1 regular-season 
MIVA slate. 

Ohio Stale, 16-19 on the 
year, defeated Ball Slate 3-1 
in last year's final to claim 
its fourth title in six years. 
To defend this season. 



however, the Buckeyes, 
ranked 10th nationally, will 
have to get by host IPFW 
1 14-12 and ranked I2th). The 
VoUeydons hold a 3-2 seiies 
edge over OSU this year and 
are 3-0 in the Multipurpose 
Athletic Center IPFW has 
enjoyed great success on 
their home court, checking 
in with a 10-2 record. 

The winner of the MIVA 
Tourney has traditionally 
earned a Iterlh in the NCAA 
Final Four- The lofty 
rankings of the teams in- 
volved in the tournament 
this season would point 
toward that probability 
again this season. 

The first MIVA champion 
was crowned in 1%1 when 
George Williams look home 
the trophy. Since then, Ball 
SlateorOhioStale have won, 
or shared, 21 of the 26 
championships. Only George 
Williams (1961, '62, '63 and 
'73) and most recently 
Kellogg Community College 
(1980) have been able lo 
break the domination. 



Four members of last 
season's all-MIVA team are 
back this year led by MVP 
Mark Edinger, Ohio State. 
Joining him are teammate 
John Loflus, IPFW's Jay 
Golsieyn and Ball Stale's 
John Waite, This year's ehte 
squad v;ill be named at the 
conclusion of the tour- 
nament. 

These teams are not 
strangers, having met four 
times during the regular- 
season series plus other 
meetings in various tour- 
naments. The coaches also 
know each other quite well, 
as both IPFW's Arnie Ball 
and OSU's Pete Hanson 
played college volleyball for 
Don Sliondell at Ball State, 
Both earned all-MIVA 
recognition, Ball in 1966 and 
'67 and Hanson in 1978 and 
'79, and were named their 
team's MVP. 

Ball (head coach) and 
Hanson (assistant) will team 
up to coach the North Squad 
in men's volleyball at the 
Olympic Sports Festival in 
Raleigh, N.C, this !

Owen and Bodine hope to lengthen season 



By DARREN J. 
WAGGONER 
Sports Editor 

Ted Owen and Phil Bodine 
weren't exposed to much 
volleyball during their high 
school years in Ihe Fort 
Wayne school system, Amie 
Ball, volleyball coach at 
IPFW. saw a great deal of 
athletic ability in the two 
players and realized they 
had Ihe potential to be 
outstanding collegiate 
volleyball players. 

Today, the hometown duo 
is one of the main reasons 
why the Votleydons have 
claimed wins over Top 20 
foes Ohio State, Navy and 
New Jersey Tech and are 
currently ranked I21h in the 
nation. That pair, and the 
rest of the IPFW squad, will 
try lo earn a trip to the 
NCAA Final .Four this 
weekend when the 

VoUeydons host Ball Slate 
and Ohio State in the Mid- 
western Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Association 
Championships The winner 



of the MIVA tourney 
traditionally earns a trip to 
the NCAA Championship 

Owen, a 6'4" senior, 
played basketball for four 
years at Heritage High 
School before enrolling at Tri 
Slate University, He didn'l 
make the Trojan basketball 
squad as a walk-on and 
decided lo return home 
and lo IPFW to continue his 
education in Electrical 
Engineering Technology. 

He has also played 
volleyball for a year at 



Heri 



and 



iraged by Ball to play that 
sporl for Ihe VoUeydons, 
Owen quickly proved he had 
what it takes to play major 
college volleyball as he 
finished second on the team 
in both blocks and kills in his 
first collegiate season, 

"Ted has really grown into 
being a superb player, 
especially at the net," Ball 
said. "He has outstanding 
leadership qualities and sets 
a great example with his 
work eiliic," 



I l\m\j^4t II Help Wanted 



Owen's 104 blocks tops the 
team this season and his 364 
kills is good tor second best. 
His 131 digs and 25 percent 
attack average also ranks 
second with teammates on 
the 15-12 team, 

'■I've learned an awful lot 
about the game since I've 
been here," Owen said, "I 
started at square one and 
had a long way to go. It's 
been a good experience and 
something I'll be able to 
carry with me for years to 



Like Owen, Bodine was a 
basketball player in high 
school and, despite his lack 
of volleyball experience. 
Ball recruited him lo play 
Ihe sport tor IPFW, 

"Volleyball and coach Ball 
IS the prime reason 1 came to 
IPFW," Bodine said, "he 
had heard some good things 
about my athletic abilities 
and asked me lo come and 
play the sport." 

Ball has said thai Bodine, 
a junior, may have the most 
raw athletic ability of 
anyone on the team, "He's 
Just an outstanding athlete," 
Ball said ot his setter "He 



had very little training 
before he came here but he's 
obviously learned quickly. 
Now he's the leader of our 
team from his seller's 
position." 

Bodine said he couldn't 
help but learn the system 
playing under Ball's watch- 
ful eye, "Coach is real 
demanding and expects a lot 
ot his players, I've never 
played for any coach that 
demands as much. His goals 
and expectations are even 
higher than mine at times. 

"He especially expecLs a 
lot out of the setter (Bodine's 
position). He was a setter 
during his college career and 
knows every little move and 
detail about the position. 

"He has brought me a long 
way over the years. Not just 
as a player but also in 
building my character. He's 
had a great influence on 



Both Owen and Bodine are 
excited aboul the rapidly 
approaching MIVA tour- 
nament and Ihink the home 
court advantage will give the 
'Dons a psychological edge 
over Ball Stale and Ohio 
Stale 



"i think we have a good 
chance ot winning on our 
home court," Owen said. 
"The winner will jusl be 
determined by who shows up 
to really play. It should be a 
high point in my career." 

Bodine shares the same 
feelings and expects the 
mental part ot the game lo 
determine the conference 
champion, "I know we can 
win," he said, "'it's jusl a 
matter of who wants it the 
most," 

■'Physically, our only 
shortcoming is our team 
depth. II will basically be up 
lo Ihe six starters and il will 
come down to altitude We 
just have to be ready lo 
play." 

Both Bodine and Owen 
have tieen ready to play 
since they first took up 
volleyballal the beginning ot 
iheir college careers Jusl a 
lew shorl years later, they 
are the leaders on a team 
that is just a few steps short 
of playing in the national 
championship tourney It's 
not a bad turn of events for a 
pair of kids that didn't know 
much aboul volleyball jusl 
three or four years ago.
