Music has been popular throughout 
the ages as a form of entertainment and 
a means of expression, but few people 
are aware of the iheropeutic value of 
music in a clinical applies lion. Musical 
therapy involves the use of music as a 
method for improving a person's 
menial and physical health 

Since IK5. IPFW's music Inerapy

or PU diploma without going 
Bloomington or West Lafayette. 

IU and PU have helped IPFW 
long way. but IPFW also deserves a lot 
of credit for being ahle to provide a high- 
quality education, 

IPFW has Ihe potential to provide the 
same quality of education, or a better 
one, while being separate from IU or 
: PU. If It gains this status, it should in- 

■ deed break away from its parent in- 
: stilulions. 

Many disagree with this plan because 
• they say a degree from the University of 
; Fort Wayne won't haveas much clout as 
;one from Indiana or Purdue. This may

■ educations from an institution located at 



- of U.S. 30 Bypass and State 
Road 37, not from IU Bloomington or PU 
Wesi Lafayette. 

In becoming independent. IPFW 
would gain autonomy IPFW ad- 
ministrators would no longer work under 
two bosses. They could make decisions 
without wondering whether or not "Mom 
and Dad" will accept them. 
Administrators at Bloomington or West 
Lafayette probably don't want IPFW to 
deviate from the norm, i.e., make 
policies different from theirs. IPFW 
administrators, however, know their 
Fort Wayne campus better than the 
administrators at Bloomington or West 
Lafayette. 

The University of Fort Wayne could 
play a vital part in helping to bring 
economic life to Fort Wayne and North- 
easten Indiana and keeping it there. 
Engineering and computer technology 
degrees could attract new industries 
while other liberal arts degrees could 
make an education truly well-rounded. 

A well- respected institution bearing 
the name of an all-American city that 
saved itself could become reality.
