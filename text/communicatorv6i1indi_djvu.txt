THE COMMUNICATOR Fri., August 30, 1974 



Election problem solved expediently 



The Chancellor and merger 



unanswered last year awaiting the coming of the super-chancellor, who is now on 
campus and quite obviously in charge of things. So it is time that we get down to 
the business of finding answers. 

The recurrent theme of the questions is unification. Will IU-PU unify in 
substance or will there be only token or apparent unification al the topmost visible 
levels of the campus structure? The consensus on campus, at least that which 
surfaces in public statements and semi-private conversations, is to achieve as total 
a merger as pi.»&gt;ihlc wiilmtil obliteration the campus identity. That makes the 
question open-ended. 

Or, taken in a more positive light, such open-endedness will nut m.-.trii t imu|ii&lt;- 
solutions to our unique problems. Unifying two institutions so diverse as I.U.' and 
Purdue without dictating the subservience of one to the other requires unique 
solutions. A third party to solution must be the Fort Wayne environment and its 
own peculiar educational needs. Given this triangular line-up, too many ground 
rules established beforehand will increase the chances of there being one or two or 
even three big losers. 

The campus must also foster a spirit of compromis. Although compromise 
may be a dirty word to the special interest groups that so ably argue their cases, an 
unwillingness to reach an equitable compromise after a good hard public debate 
will again increase the chances for big losers. 

Of course, this means that the sabre-rattlers will have to sheath their swords 
(or the time being so that the best possible solutions can be achieved and achieved 
quickly. Too much in the way of polemics - this newspaper stands among those 
which have proven to be so inclined on oeeassion -- will mean too little in the way of 



themselves on record for both. It will be Chancellor Schwartz's job to keep them 

This brings us right back to where we left off last year. The responsibility for 
the future of the campus rests squarely in the lap of one man, last year some 
unknown super-chancellor, today Chancellor Schwartz. 

When he accepted the job, Dr. Schwartz committed himself to a full 
investigation of the situation, promised a sensitivity to local problems, and 
determined to find a solution tlul is in I lie IhsI interests of the Fort Wayne Campus. 

Responsibility is a iwo wflj street. We must give him our support when he 
goes to the presidents, the boards of trustees, the community, and the legislature to 
argue the IU-PU case. We must accept Ins decisions even though he may decide 
against our own particular special interest We are obligated to express faith in his 
ability to administer IU-PU wisely WY helped choose him tor I he job, now we must 
help him do it. 

Last year very little was accomplished toward unification because we hod no 
super-chancellor Now we have one, and that excuse can no longer be used by those 
who wish to slow the process. It is time to move ahead. 



That beautiful sidewalk 



Last year The Communicator regularly complained about the lack of a 
sidewalk between the North B Lot and the Student Union. We are happy to be able 
to report that the sidewalk was constructed over the summer. In fact two 
sidewalks were built : one following the top of the ridge from the lot to the west side 
of the Union, and the other going down the slope to the east side of the building. 

Also, all B lots were paved with money accumulated in the parking fund to pay 
for a parking garage that we can't afford and now officially don't need. 

In spite of the fact that the administration has preempted our favorite 
complaint, rest assured that the editors of this paper will not rest until we have 
uncovered a new one.
