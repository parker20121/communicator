1,000 prospective students check out IPFW 



IPFW program helps teens focus after high school, set goal 



For some urcn students, life after 
high school now has a direction. 

"Life Afier High School: 
Challenges. Choices, Careers and 
College Sclcclion" is a free program 
designed lo give 10th mid Uth graders 
the opportunity to explore the endless 
choices they have to make after high 

The program offers activities that 
spark interest in various professional 



fields and uncover hidden interests and 

The program is funded by the 
Foellingcr Foundation and is offered at 
five area universities: IPFW; Saint 
Francis College; Indiana Institute of 

Technology, and Taylor University. 

"Overall, I think this program goes 
into more of what will really happen in 
college," said Korisha Chapman -Lyles, 
a high school sophomore participant. "It 
teaches you more than high school 
leathers could prepare you for." 

The program curriculum began on 




July II and will continue until August 
5. The sessions begin at 8:30 a.m. and 
last until 12:30 p.m.. Monday through 
Friday. Each Friday, a Held trip that 
relates lo what has been learned earlier 
in the week is scheduled. Sludents also 
have the opportunity to take a trip to the 
Indiana Youth Institute in Indianapolis, 
and a trip (o Central Stale Universily. 

The "Life After High School" pro- 
gram is part of Ihc Fori Wayne Summer 
Youth Initiative Program, which focus- 
es on the futures of Allen County youih. 

Bettye Poignard, director of 



Multicultural Services at IPFW, is 
founder of ihe program. 

Teens can choose to allend the pro- 
gram at one of the five universities of 
their choosing lo enhance their under- 
standing of their own fulures afler four 
years of high school. Olher area pro- 
grams deal with exploring ihc liberal 
arts, sports, career awareness in (he 
technologies, and hands-on experience 
in science, computers, business and 
mathematics. 

"I think it is an opportunity to give 
young people hands-on, tangible infor- 



mation thai Ihcy can utilize after life 
from high school," said Charles 
Washington, associate director of career 
services and staff member for the "Life 
Afler High School" program. The rest 
of the program staff includes Tim Lake 
and Paulina Salvador, advisers in IPFW 
Multicultural Services, Denisc Williams 
of Junior Achievement and Joanne 
Tarango. student worker.

Society soon to be electronic I Faculty Forum 



I 1 irii'jir i w Man tiU rather quietly in 
his home wailing for his wife to return 
from her day al Ihc tall mines. Hit day 
generally begins and ends early so that 
be can bypass Ihc infamous banker') 
hour ir.illn. lhat is inevilnble across 
every phone line in ihc country. This is 
to because Tomorrow Man's line of 
work is as much as 90% dependent on 
information which comes into bis home 
office through (he telephone delivering 
tent, pholoi and video. 

It will help lo illustrate what 
Tomorrow Man is capable of and or the 
type* of things he may take for granted 
in day-to-day life. On a whim he con 
dial up any movie he wants lo walch at 
any given moment, piny video game* 
with friends from Ireland, shop, or even 
take care of banking. He can look 
through the collections of books at any 
library or university, make travel 
arrangements, lour the vaults of a 
museum, and when watching a football 
game he can view plays from any num- 
ber of angles and sec stats or scores 
whenever he wants to-all through the 
television in his living room. This tele- 
vision Is even programmed lo record 
various shows that it knows he will be 
interested in throughout the day, score 
them, and play them back al his conve- 
nience. 

Step out the door into the rest of the 
world and he's making video phone 
calls through his car stereo, buying the- 
ater tickets through automated teller 
moehincs (ATMs), faxing hand-written 
memos which automatically type them- 
selves Trom on electronic scribble pad 
the size of a daily planner, having a 
medical problem diagnosed by a spe- 
cialist on (he other side of the globo or 
learning from an acclaimed teacher in 
'the same manner. 

For Tomorrow Man, the informa- 
tion superhighway is indeed a futurist's 
yellow brick road. All sorts of wonder- 
ful and unenviable things exist. All the 
information and connectivity to work 
completely at home and enough shop- 
ping channels lo slock his domicile 
with piles of useless junk. Can the 
imagination satisfy the ramifications of 
a channel for every brand name? Just 
imagine, the Cap channel. Ihc K-Mart 
channel, Ihc Li/. Claiborne channel. Ihc 
1 -900-B1G-BOYS channel. For him the 
possibilities change with every new 
company or entrepreneurial mind that 
comes into existence. It's not all about 
business though and only a fool could 
believe it is. It's a Mecca for minds and 
beauty; technology that keeps one close 
to humanity because that humanity is 
always around you, inseparable from 
who! becomes existence. Opera chan- 
nels, horticulture, archaeological, liter- 
ature, and science channels, all waiting 
to be tuned in and absorbed, and every 
one of them interactive. More informa- 
tion,, commerce and arts than any crea- 
ture has been exposed [o ever. 
Businesses will profit from new mar- 
kets, new customers, and expanded 
awareness of their goods and services. 
The ones who truly benefit arc 
mank in. In form a I ion is democracy and 
the basis of intelligence, and the world 
is close lo getting a bellyful. 

These abilities all began with a few 
three- billion -dollar mergers, in paiticu- 



olher businesses became involved i 
the project. As research and develop- 
ment brought about the necessary 
equipment, widespread exchange of 
information in several forms became 



All of this in and of itself is quite 
amazing and will be available to the 
average Joe at a moderate cost. Likely, 
it will come free to those who will ben- 
efit the greatest from its diverse oppor- 
tunities, individuals such as students to 
whom such technology would be the 
equivalent of a chicken in every pot. 

What Tomorrow Man takes for 
granted, however, is what those of us 
todoy arc going to be striving for over 
the next several years In order for the 
ideal connectivity to be achieved, fiber 
optic wire will have to be strung via 
conventional telephone lines lo every 
home in America. It sounds like one 
hell of a (ask and indeed it is. The num- 
bers necessary to accomplish this are 
horrific if you consider, as on example, 
how the last mile of wire from a per- 
son's house for today's existing cable 
companies represents 80% of their 
infrastructure and that 95vn of the 94.2 
million television homes arc wired, 
though merely 62% subscribe. 

While information-multimedia com- 
panies wait for crews to lay their fiber 
optic lines, they'll likely be utilizing 
the capabilities of a new technology 
known as Asymmetric Digital 
Subscriber Line (ADSL) which makes 
possible the tronsmission of com- 
pressed video over ordinary copper 
wires white maintaining the ability to 
support voice conversations. 
Compression allows eight to ten video 



miles before needing a boost, therefore 
coming out clean and crisp. 

These signals would be transmitted 
to your television through a computer 
masquerading as a cable box which 
would perform the necessary functions 
to interpret incoming digital data and 
play it for the viewer. All of this infor- 
mation comes to the computer "digi- 
tized." that is, much like a compact 
disc's recording, in a sense of ones and 
zeros that moke up a language which 
computers can understand. 

Another technology option which 
allows digitized media lo be sent over 
existing copper wires is called the 
Integrated Services Digital Network 
(ISDN) ISDN currently is only suit- 
able for voice and text applications 
though if advances occur, it could 
prove to be a wildly cost-reduced short- 
cut to long-term wiring goals. 

As for as pure information is con- 
cerned, the working model everybody 
seems to be after is a unified group of 
computer networks called the Internet . 
Internet, a communication spider web 
lhat actually exists at this moment, is 
essentially comprised of computers 
connected by coaxial cable or modems, 
which change data into signals that can 

Internet is made up by more than 
10,000 networks being accessed from 
libraries, businesses and government 
agencies. Ii is estimated that as many as 
30 million people already use this sys- 
tem. During the course of the year, a

panies came together they opened up to 
22 million customers in 59 of the top 
100 most profitable markets. This 
impressed other companies enough to 
follow their leod. Eventually as many 



channels to exisi harmoniously in the 
same bandwidth normally required for 
one. In this way, music television 
(MTV) becomes eight to ten music 
channels. Current wire technology 
can't handle the bulk of such compli- 
cated media. ADSL signals tend to dis- 
integrate into so much gelatin fizz over 
long distances so its main purpose 
would be to feed for the "last mile" off 
of fiber optic cable which can travel for 



through cable lines, making it even

pur- 



poses and values in such a diverse . 
ely? Consider the following: The gulf 
between the rich and the poor continues 
to widen; the number of special interest 
groups claiming victim status and, 
therefore, entitlements continues lo 
increase; the "establishment" defends 
the status quo and would rather not 
share what it has wilh others; the disen- 
franchised compete against each other 
for social, political, and economic gain; 
discrimination and racism are pan of 
the everyday existence for countless 
individuals, and ethnic groups are 



focused on celebrating their ■ 
itage to the exclusion of others 

How do you build community when 
such disparities abound? Where are we 
beaded as a nation if we can't find the 
common ground to come together as a 
community? Where do we begin? 
Perhaps right here. The curriculum can 
provide the historical contribution, cus- 
toms, and values of our various her- 
itages, and student life and staff devel- 
opment programs can bring about an 
understanding and appreciation of our 
varied cultures. We can foster diversity

I'm as guilty of blowing off the 
fourth of July like everybody else My 
family, especially my father, has never 
liked the Fourth much. The fact that he 
was born in Vicksburg. Mississippi, 
could have something to do with it — 
just because the confederates surren- 
dered Vicksburg on the Fourth of July, 
my father refuses to celebrate anything 
on lhat day 

As the first Yankee bom into a fami- 
ly of Stoic southerners. I am constantly 
reminded of their great southern sover- 
eignly. I know that, regardless of the 
general sentiments of my family, the 
Fourth is a good day to relax. My father 
gave bis permission to let my family 
celebrate July Fourth at his borne. 

My family's homecoming prompted 
my mother to cook up one of her 
famous southern suppers: Virginia ham, 
combread, collard greens, red beans 
and a large sugar cream pie. I con- 
tributed the fireworks for this Fourth of 
July homecoming After supper. I near-

My father admires this project for 
our veterans. I am slowly changing his 
opinion on the importance of ihc Founh 
of July as we both learn more about

has increased as he tells me of his war

What I did this Fourth of July really 
can't be considered blowing it off. My

Student newspapers, particularly at 
Ihc collegiate level, fall victim to the 
political power slruclurc thai exists 
within moil universities and institutions 
of higher 1 e ami rig 



student newspapers as too verbal on 
issues that do not coincide with Ihe 
administration's views. 

If certain key people, let's say alum- 
ni, happen not to like or disapprove of 
the content of the publication, a chain 
reaction staru to occur, 

II begins with ceitain influential 
people being upset wiib the content of 
a paper and then trickles down to those 
individual] who are in certain adminis- 
trative positions. Those persons are then 
' 'pressured" into making not only the 
alumni comfortable hut other high offi- 
cials as well- 
Unfortunately, through manipulating 
and calculating actions, they attempt 
and sometimes even succeed in taking 
away a student's rights lo write and 
express their individual opinions and 
beliefs. 

These same people tend to throw 
around such rhetoric like, students 
being the first priority with the adminis- 
tration, Yet if you in anyway do some- 
thing lo cause their boats to rock, be 
prepared for retaliation. 



Another term used quite willingly is Such issues as poor grammar, mis-

In ihe same breath these people will 
be the first to stale the importance of 
having a campus paper It is quite ironic 
how this statement is often forgotten 
when so-called controversial issues and 
ideas arc put inlo print. 

Some administrators will then try 
and knock the integrity and morals of 
those students who work diligently and 
bravely to express these views in the 



These issues are only scapegoats 
employed by administrators to disguise 
their real dislike for some campus pub- 
lications. 

Ii remains painfully true that real 
integrity and honesty arc nut wanted by 
those in administrative positions, who 
attempt lo suppress opinion that docs 
not support the status quo. Here arc 
some of the famous last words repeated 
by many campus officials. 
We want a diversified campus with 



different issues being tackled 
(i.e., you should print and discuss things 
wc wish to hear and in such a manner 
that we feet is suitable.) 

According to the "Law of Ihe 
Student Press," in the case Thonen vs 
Jenkins, "the editor of the college news- 
paper was expelled from school for 
publishing j letter to the editor critical 
of the university president and referring 
10 the president with a four-letter word. 
(The author of Ihc letter was also kicked 
out of school.) A federal court ordered 
them both reinstated." 

In another case of Scruff vs 
Williams, the "Law of the Student 
Press." slated that Ihe president of 
Florida Atlantic University fired three 
editors in 1973. "The president stated 
several reasons for taking such a action. 
He claimed that the paper embarrassed 
and brought disrepute to the school 
because of its poor grammar, spelling 
and use of language. The U.S. Coun of 
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reinstated 
the students. The president was also 
ordered to pay the students money dam- 
ages for violating their First

Smack. Companies are laboring to 
moke this easier and one potential solu- 
tion may be a form of software called 
Knowbots. You merely punch in what 
ihc topic is and off the Knowbots flut- 
ter, returning within minutes with 
everything you could ever possibly 
need. Here again, another problem pre- 
sents itself in lhal too many Knowbots 
might conceivably be looking for the 
same information at the same lime and 
you run inlo a logistical, electronic 
nightmare. Il is a problem that develop- 
ers will have to seriously consider. 

The most interesting aspect of inter- 
net though is a type of software referred 
to as Multi-User Dimensions (MUDS) 
which allows people to talk and interact 
with other people lo talk and inleracl 
with other people all around the country 
in real-time. That is to say, as fast as a 
person can lype, he can answer a ques- 
tion or perform an action MUDs arc in 
use heavily on Internet and other on- 
line services like CompuServe though 
special rates are often applied which 
make il excessively expensive form of 
entertainment for those who get too 
comfortable wondering around in il. 

CompuServe works MUDs both as a 
communication tool pritLjn a _£ ajiuiig 
system while Internet runs it as an actu- 
al cyberspace environment in which a 
person receives an address comprised 



of a number of digits. From here the 
individual can wander out into the vir- 
tual community using literal, single- 
scnlcncc commands such as "Look at 
Judy," or the like. The computer then 
responds by saying. "You've looked fll 
Judy," and then Judy has an opportuni- 
ty to respond to your action. 

People con do onything that can be 
done in real life; go out lo clubs, go 
shopping, meet people and set up dates. 
there's even something called "cyber- 
sex" where two people on-line step inlo 
a "room" by themselves and start get- 
ting descriptive. 

MUDs pose a rather threatening 
psychological precedent in that they ore 
highly addictive forms of entertainment 
especially for lonely homebodies and 
couch potatoes turned interactive 

Internet is nol the only model cur- 
rently being pursued, however. AT&amp;T 
is investing heavily in a system called 
Ihc ImagiNalion Network, formerly 
known as Sierra On-Linc with plans to 
create a nationwide video game net- 
work. You'll be able to plug into this 
with your SEGA Genesis, 3DO's 
Mulitplayer. or a system AT&amp;T is 
developing called the Edge 16.

You didn't hear it from me, but. 



Ity F. Lane Doum, 
Acllvllles Editor 

You didn'i bear i( from me, bin Ibey 
ore -.ii 1 1 grouping us all up and counting 
ui ai one. Of course when one looks ai 
Ihll Halcmenl, you are probably won- 
dering what I am talking aboul. Well. 
I'm going to tell you. Recently on 
Channel 21. Michael Worrell, chancel- 
lor of IPFW. staled on television that 
there were tome black tenured profes- 
sors on campus. 

What's the big deal, you're proba- 
bly thinking. Well, I've been on cam- 
pus for some time {several years) and 
have yet to sec any tenured black pro- 
lessor* on this campus. Dul then again, 
my definition of black is different From 
the administration's definition and 
that's the problem. Most Channel 21 
viewers would interpret Worrell's state- 
ment as meaning there are African- 
American professors on this campus 
who have tenure, which is not true. 

To most Americans, black is syn- 
onymous with being African American, 
I think it is fair for us to admit that 
whenever people refer to African 
Americans in this country, they will 
associate these people with the word 
"black." "Those black*...," "Being 
black in America is.,.." or "Black like 
me" arc phrases in which African 
Americans ore associated with the word 
"black." 

According to the EEOC regulations 
the university uses in determining sta- 
tistics, there arc categories that are used 
"to describe groups to which individu- 
als belong, identify with, or belong in 
the eyes oi the community. The cate- 
gories do not denote scientific defini- 
tions of anthropological origins. A per- 
son may be counted in only one 
group," 

The definition of "black, non- 
Hispanic" is a person having origins in 
any of the black racial groups of Africa 
(except those of Hispanic origin) 

This is the definition that the uni- 
versity uses when compiling statistics 
for this campus, which causes African 
Americans to be misrepresented. If 
truth be told, what these people arc 
basically doing is lying with the fig- 
ures. The black professors who have 
tenure on this campus arc not African- 
Americans. All African-American pro- 
fessors on this campus ore associate 
professors which goes to show that 
IPFW has not made any progress what- 
soever in increasing the number of 
African- American faculty on campus.

Aunt Louise speaks on the O.J. case 




Editor's note: The Communicator is 
pleased to welcome Aunt Ifiuise back 
to the staff. She wants to thank her 
readers for the flowers and cards, and 
would tike them to know that she is 
recovering well from her recent stroke. 



Dear Aunt Louise. 

How arc you doing? I thought you 
had passed away because your column 
had not appeared in the paper for some 

Anyway, I have a problem. 1 have 
a boyfriend who continues to compare 
me sexually to his other girlfriends. 

I know it's disrespectful but I love 



him. I have told him repeatedly not to 
do it but be continues to. What should 
I do? 

Is love enough to continue to lake 
this treatment? 

Sincerely. 

Is Love Enough? 

Dear Is Love Enough, 

Honey. I'm glad you're concerned 
about me. And no, I'm not dead! Your 
auntie is far from that. Anyway, dove, 
it sounds like you have some major 
problems in your life. You do not have 
to take such bad mouthin' from any 
feller. 

You tell him to treat you with 
respect and dignity. And if he can't do 
that — you need to leave him. Honey, 
you will be better off by yourself. 

Why, if my Dorcus would ever say 
anything disrespectful to me he would 
find himself in the bam with cows. 

Your loving Aunt Louise 

Dear Aunt Louise, 



1 am sick and lira! of the State vi 
OJ. Simpson. It is completely ridicu- 
lous. I missed at least two weeks of 
my soap operas. There is no reason 
why they couldn't have just kept it on 
CNN or Court TV Now 1 have to wait 
to see how my dear friend Erica it 
doing on "All My Children" and l&gt;e on 
pins and needles as to what happens to 
girlfriend Dorian Lord on "One life to 



Dtar Tired of the State, 

Rosebud, I know exactly what you 
are talking about. They arc putting this 
poor man's business all in the televi- 
sion and over the newspapers, I tell 
you no one has rights anymore. People 
need to have private lives. I wish they 
would lake it off television myself. 
Honey, enjoy your soaps while you

Your loving Aunt Lout 



away with this misrepresentation? 

Because of the way the government 
defines black, Hispanic, and even 
white, the university is allowed to lump 
all people who ore of African descent 
into one group to make it look as if 
there arc large numbers of blacks in a 
particular area. Or in other words, they 
use the statistics to show that people of 
color arc being hired in the workplace. 
By the way, all you folks out there 
who have origins that trace back to 
Europe, North Africa, or the Middle 
East arc considered white in this coun- 
try.uccording to the EEOC. 

Now, I think wc need lo go deeper 
than that. People may ask what is the 
point of this argument, say that blacks 
are being represented, and ask, "What 
are you bitching aboul?" 

I am bitching about the fact that 
Africans and African Americans have 
totally different realities. Some 
Africans come from privileged fami- 
lies, receive belter educations, and 
encounter little or no racial discrimina- 
tion in their native countries. Whereas. 
African Americans continue to live Ihe 
American nightmare in which they are 
continually being discriminated against 
on the basis of skin color, receive infe- 
rior educations, arc economically 
enslaved, and arp indirectly pro- 
grammed to participate in their own 



make the distinction in terms of statis- 
tics and the number of Africans and 
African Americans because they both 
have different experiences based on 
their origin of birth. 

The distinction shows how much 
progress African Americans have made 
in earning those types of positions in 
the arena of education. 

So, what does the fact that wc have 
two tenured African professors and a 
handful of associate or part-time 
African -American professors say about 
this campus? 

It should send a clear message to the 
administration that there must be an 
extensive campaign 10 attracting more 
African -American professors for tenure 
track positions on this campus. Not 
only should African -Americans be 
recruited for tenure track positions, but 
high-level decision-making 

positions, too. For instance, there are 
two high-level positions opened on this

Marilyn Manson sings American murder tale 



From Trenl Reznor and John Maun 
Jr's own label, "Nothing Records" and 
"Interscope," comes the first album 
from Fort Lauderdale, Florida's 
Marilyn Mansons, "Portrait Of An 
American Family" Produced and 
mixed with Reznor, it includes a num- 
ber of truly abrasive, threatening tracks 
such as "Mother Inferior Got Her 
Gunn" mixed in with a startling, medi- 
tative, broodish "Revelation #9." Given 
Reznor's own fascination with the gris- 
ly American murder tale and his close 
proximity to its victim's final resting 
place, Marilyn Manson is quite a fitting 
addition to the label's list. Aboul six of 
the tracks, including "Organ Grinder," 
were mixed in Sharon Tate's old resi- 
dence, as well as some of the vocals. 
They destroyed most of ihe American 



xploit television shows such as Inside 
Edition and a Current Affair. Typical 
topics in these programs ore- the death 
of Marilyn Monroe and the grisly 
Charles Manson story. 

"Pop culture seemed to revolve 
around these two people the way I was 
seeing it. I thought putting those two 
together made a strange dichotomy. I 
thought it would be interesting to lake a 
thesis and antithesis and put them 
together and sec what you came up 
with. It seemed to be neither good nor 
bad, male nor female, and that's what I 
wanted to stand for, that's what I want- 
ed my band to stand for. Society has 
made Manson equally as famous as 
Marilyn Monroe, and it's the same with 
all the serial killers. People want that

in a way, denouncing it by attempting 
to replicate its worts emotions in music, 
looking ai the culture through cryptic 
glasses that twist the ideology of com- 
mon men into hate-filled reflections of 
self. 

The songs ore like a cracked mirror,

campus: the vice-chancellor of academ- 
ic affairs and dean of education. Since 
the campus bos no women or people of

appropriate to attempt to recruit quali- 
fied women or people of color for those 
positions. 

1 engaged in dialogue with David 
Cox. dean of the School of Arts and 
Sciences, who suggested that part of the 
reason for lack of African -American 
professors is because of the small num- 
ber of qualified applicants and because 



IPFW is not on the "grapevi 
munication. The grapevine he was 
referring to is the networking that acad- 
emic; have between each other in terms 
of information about IPFW, which I 
feci is a valid reason. However, I feel 
that the university nonetheless needs to 
make sure that it ends up on the 
grapevine or the campus will continue 
to lack in diversity- 
One of the biggest problems for this 
campus is the fact that the pool of qual- 
ified African- American candidates is 
very small. Bui every school ci

things. People are going to make me 
out to he the devil and the Antichrist 
and all of these bad things Closed- 
minded people always fail lo realize 
that truth is all according to your per- 
spective. Where I'm at, I don't see 
myself as bad or consider what I'm 
doing as bad. It all depends on your 
standing, and the truth is only relative 
to who believes it," said Manson. ♦

Free Indiana reflects a growing trend 
of Hoosicr youths lo increase their 
consumption of marijuana and ciga- 
rette use. 

The Indiana Prevention Resource 
Center (IPRC) at Indiana University, 
Bloominglon, released Ihe latest statis- 
tics from their annual survey. 

"The good news is. we found some 
continued improvement in lifetime and 
past-year use of alcohol, which sug- 
gests that there is some reduction in 
experimentation with alcohol among 
children and adolescents," said 
William Doiley. IPRC director. 



81,732 students in 350 schools par- 
ticipated, with grades 5-12 included in 
the survey. 

Other statistics released from the 
survey show monihly usage of mari- 
juana smoking among graduating 
seniors in Indiana high schools rose 
from 17 .8 percent in 1993 to 21.6 per- 
cent in 1994 Daily use increased from 
4.2 percent lo 6 percent, 

According lo Bailey, there had been 
several years of improvement on most 
of ibe measures wiih the exception of 
the past year, with most of the drug use 
measures remaining identical to the 
previous year. 

Bailey said possible reasons for the 
increase include a de-emphasis on 
marijuana in education and law 
enforcemenl programs, Ihe news
