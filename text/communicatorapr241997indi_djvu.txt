Earth Day 1997: Time for global spring cleaning 



by Natalie Hess 
Chief Reporter 

During the 27th annual Earth 
Day celebration on Sunday, 
April 20, at Franke Park, 
bands, area businesses, clubs and 
citizens of the Fori Wayne area col- 
lected outside at Pavilion 1 to enjoy 
the sun and celebration under the 
theme "Building a Cleaner, Greener 
Community". 

"We like to make sure people 
know this day is important," said 
Casey Lengachcr, project director of 



IP Raycing. 

IP Raycing is a project to make a 
solar power car on campus to race in 
1999. 

Lengaeher and Correne Miller, 
assistant business manager of IP 
Raycing, helped sell Earth Day T- 
shins with the Biology Club's Earth 
Day Committee in order to both pro- 
mote the IP Raycing project and to 
support the celebration of Earth Day. 

"We've been doing this for eight 
or nine years," said David Zub, 
Biology Club president. 

"This is the first year we've had 



it off campus though," said Zub. 

From 11 am. until 6 p.m., the 
Earth Day Festival unraveled 
Children were participating in face 
painting, musical chairs and card 
creating. Storyteller Jim Can also 
made an appearance. Hair wraps 
costing SI an inch were also being 
done in front of the tent housing the 
bands. Children were also intro- 
duced to Indian games such as kick- 
ing billets, spear throwing and dice 
playing. 

Usquebaugh, Might As Well, 
Todd Harrold Band and Rushville 




Whig provided musical entertain- 
ment throughout Sunday's festival. 
Rushville Whig provided free enter- 
tainment The other three bands 
charged $100 to cover the cost of a 
sound system. 

"We usually break even. We 
charge S20 to each vendor not sell- 
ing items," said Zub. Otherwise, 
they must pay the Fort Wayne Parks 
and Recreation Department. 

Earth Day T-shirts were sold for 
S12. Last year's were $5. IPFW stu- 
dents passed out programs for the 
day and talked about the IP Raycing 
at one booth. 

"Solar energy uses Ihe sun to 
operate, so it saves Earth's 
resources," said Miller, 

Miller and Lengacber said that 
Earth Day issues pertained to the 
goal of IP Raycing. 

Area participants were Allen 
County Solid Waste District, 
Headwaters Park, Izaak Walton 
League, Fox Island Alliance, 
C.A.R.E., City Utilities, City of Fort 
Wayne, Fort Wayne's Children Zoo, 



ACRES Land Trust, Hackley 
Associates. Pontiac Youth Center- 
Unity Crew and Little River 
Wetlands. 

Allen County Solid Waste 
District passed out brochures pro- 
moting recycling, conservation and 
non toxic alternatives (o daily living 

Headwaters Park displayed 
models of the park and designs of 
constructions. The display adver- 
tised future constructions, such as 
the Fate of Armory. The table vol- 
unteer also introduced the Festival 
Center opening this summer as part 
of Phase III. She described how the 
space would be used to host this 
year's Three Rivers Festival food 
court and vendors. 

The volunteer manning the Fort 
Wayne Children's Zoo told those 
walking by of the two new tiger 
quolls that will be in the Australian 
Welcome Center at the April 26 
opening. 

ACRES Land Trust passed out 
Giant Zinnia seeds and used picture 
displays to advertise Ihe preserva- 



tion of woods, wedands and wildlife 
through 29 nature preserves in 
Northeast Indiana. 

At the Little River Wetlands 
Project booth, blueprints helped 
describe the goal of establishing a 
park in Southwest Allen County that 
would offer canoeing, fishing, hik- 
ing, hunting and nature centers. By 
gathering support and interest, the 
Little River Wetlands Project's long- 
term goal is to reclaim up to ten 
square miles of land where years ago 
the Little River connected the head- 
waters of the Maumee with the 
Wabash. 

An awareness of the issues and 
local efforts to both preserve and 
cherish the nature of Fort Wayne 
were the ideals of Sunday's Earth 
Day Festival. 

"We actually didn't have as 
many vendors here this year as years 
before," said Zub.'That is because 
we got our information packets out 
really late. They didn't go out until 
about a month ago rather than two or 
three months ago."

Campus to host math and science camp 



by Natalie Hess 
Chief Reporter 

The third IPFW Math and 
Science Camp is going to be held 
from Monday, July 28, to Friday, 
August 1. The 1997 camp is 
designed for students entering the 
seventh and eighth grades in the 
fall. 

"Some literature on math stu- 
dents indicates that middle school 
students are at the make it or break 
it age," said Josue Libii, coordinator 
of the camp. "At this point siudents 
decide that cither math is boring or 
interesting and are on a track either 
to learn more or forget about it." 

The camp uses curricula from 
the National Science Center Task 
Force to offer sessions that build 
problem-solving skills in mathe- 
matics and physical science by 
getting students to gel involved 
bodily and through hands-on 
experience in labs. 

"We try not to have it be much 
like a classroom," said Joyce Vetter, 



instructor of Mathematical 
Sciences. 

Vetter said that last year they 
held a measurement Olympics in 
which siudents measured things 
outdoors. They also designed T- 
shirts as one of their projects. 
Designs were made using pattern 
blocks and pentaminoes, several 
shapes using areas of five square 
inches. 

"We try to gel them to work in 
groups. We bring in manipula- 
tes like pentaminoes. pattern 
blocks and multi-linked cubes," 
said Vetter. 

Fifty siudenis will be accepted 
on a first come, first serve basis lo 
the camp. 

"It is noi a remedial program 
nor targeting extra- talented siu- 
dents." said Libii. 

Libii said he and another facul- 
ty member debated whether to ask 
for transcripts or letters of recom- 
mendation but decided against ii. 
Instead they are interested in chil- 
dren who gain something from 



being wilh others and are interested 
in the sciences. 

"Mix is important to us. We're 
not trying lo get them ahead of the 
class," said Libii. 

The camp will operate from 
8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. daily. Cost is 
S75 per student. 

Faculty running the IPFW Math 
and Science Camp include Arthur 
Friedel of chemistry, David 
Maloney of physics, Joyce Vetter of 
mathematical sciences and Sunday 
Fascyitan of manufacturing tech- 
nology. Area teachers Judy 
Hayhurst of Canterbury Middle 
School and Connie Anderson of 
Creslview Middle School along 
wilh high school volunteers who 
were past attendants of the camp 
will also be helping in Ihe week's 
activities. 

The IPFW Math and Science 
Camp is sponsored by the 
National Science Cenier-Task 
Force, IPFW, ITT, Hughes 
Pefense Communications and 
local businesses. 



Students are always, encour- 
aged (o join organizations on cam- 
pus. Nevertheless, ii is rare thai a 
3.5 GPA is required to gel induct- 
ed inio it. 

The IPFW Alpha Kappa Nu 
Chapter of Phi Kappa Theta Honor 
Society held its annual induction 
ceremony in Walb Memorial 
Union, Room 224, on April 6. 
During the evening introductions 
were made, a keynoie address was 
given and 22 siudents were induct- 
ed into the honor society. 

According lo Sarah Beckman, 
adviser of the Alpha Kappa Nu 
Chapter, the Phi Theia Kappa 
Honor society is an organization 
thai is self-selected based on aca- 
demic standing in a two-year col- 
lege. 

"It's an opportunity lo continue 
developing and to further progress 
in skills needed in society," said 
Beckman. "Students will benefit 
from getting involved: there are 



millions of dollars worth of schol- 
arships given every year." 

The keynoie address was 
given by Anna Fulkerson. alumna 
and past president of Alpha Kappa 
Nu. She emphasized ihe impor- 
tance of an effective leader who 
recognizes when he or she needs 
help. 

"It is important to ask and then 
accepl help from fellow officers 
and members in this organization." 
said Fulkerson. 

Fulkerson also encouraged 
involvement and active participa- 
tion. 

"You get out of this organiza- 
tion what you put into it," said 
Fulkerson. 

Recenily, IPFW's Phi Theia 
Kappa Chapter was ciled as a 
"Three-Star Chapter" ai a recent 
regional convention. 

"This award recognizes ihe 
chapters' attainment of the many 
goals its members committed (o 
achieving during the pasi regional 
calendar year as pari of the soci- 
ety's chapter development pro- 
gram," said Rod A. Risley, execu- 



tive director of ihe Phi Theta 
Kappa. 

Risley said the Alpha Kappa 
Nu Chapter has continually proven 
itself as an exemplary model of 
Phi Theta Kappa's four hallmarks: 
scholarship, leadership, fellow- 
ship, service. 

The chapter will receive inter- 
national recognition when the 
"1997 Awards Tabloid" is dis- 
tributed at the 79th International 
Convention in Dallas, today 
through Saturday. 

"The best are recognized at 
regional conventions: the very 
best gel recognized and judged at 
iniemalionals," said Beckman. 

No one from the Alpha Kappa 
Nu Chapter will be attending the 
convention this year. 

Beckman says thai the honor 
society is unique in that the other 
societies have faculty involve- 
ment. 

"Phi Kappa Nu would not sur- 
vive without its involvement," 
said Beckman "It's nice to sec lhai 
we can do ii here, just like any 
other campus."

Oh where oh where can he be? 

On Monday, eighteen days after an Air Force warplane broke for- 
mation and disappeared over Arizona, scraps of paper led a helicopter 
crew to the plane's apparent crash site on a high peak in Colorado. 

The plane has been missing since its pilot. Capt. Craig Buiion, took 
off fronv a Tucson, Anz.. base on a routine training mission and veered 
north, heading to Colorado wilh four bombs aboard. 

An Army National Guard helicopter crew spoiled the wreckage 
while hovering above the unnamed steep cliff near New York Mountain 
and Gold Dusk Peak, 1 5 miles southwest of Vail. 

Officials said the wreckage seems to be missing the A-10 
Thunderbolt. There was no sign of Button, who could have ejected with- 
out the Air Force's knowledge. 

Threatening storms have prevented a full search from taking place. 



To have one's individuality completely ignored 
Is like being pushed quite out of life. Like being blown

Staff Editorials 



Students, paper 
accomplish much 



li is finally that time of year — 
the end of spring semester and 
beginning of summer vacation. In 
the first staff editorial this semester 
we encouraged every student to par- 
ticipate in the makings of our stu- 
dent's newspaper and many of you 
did, and so we extend our gratiiude 
to you. 

For those of you who did not 
participate in the production of the 
paper, yet remained faithful readers, 
we appreciate your dedication and 
interest. The Communicator met 
many new faces and writers this 
semester thai contributed to the 
quality of this paper. 

Many are not aware of the 
dedication il takes to put out a 
paper so we want to bring to light 
the difficult task each of you had 
in taking pan in our paper one 
way or another. 

Most everyone who took part in 
the paper had a number of other 
obligations (o balance when they 
decided lo add yei another view, 
opinion, pholo, poem, news or 
sports story to enhance the pages of 
The Communicator. 

Everyone learned that deadlines 
and stress are commonplace in an 
environment such as this, so we 
were pleased lo meet so many deler- 
mined, focused and captivating peo- 
ple during our experience here. And 
since criticism has to be part of our 
job, we think highly of those brave 
enough to listen to our arguments 
and then make the criticisms work 
for you. You helped make our 
paper a more representative, 
interesting paper. 

To those of you who fell com- 
pelled to respond to the content of 
our paper by writing letters to the 
editor — your comments (disagree- 
ing and all) are equally appreciated. 
It is gratifying to know that we have 



readers who were compelled 
enough by our writings to si( down 
and write a letter responding one 
way or another about some aspect 
of our paper. 

By participating you have 
shown thai not only are you doing 
your part lo ensure your voice. 
interests and views are heard here 
on campus, but also that you care 
about the quality of work that repre- 
sents you. 

We know there are many of you 
who were interested in writing for 
the paper, but that you were cither 
too busy or had a fear of writing. 
For those too busy — there is 
always next time. For those who 
have a fear of writing we under- 
stand that fear to be very real and 
are willing lo help you overcome it 
as long as you are willing to hear 
constructive criticism (believe us, 
all of our writing gets criticized - 
that is how we learn). 

We also know that there are 
those of you who continually criti- 
cize our work and are never pleased 
with its content. You may expect 
our response lo be one of negativity 
— think again. Even though no one 
enjoys being criticized, we expect 
it. If we didn't, we wouldn't be in 
this business. Criticism, when con- 
structive, is a necessary part of 
learning which forces improvement 
on our behalf. 

However, when it's criticism 
just for criticisms sake - you fail to 
get your point across. 

All in all, this paper had a great 
semester and it would not have been 
possible without all of you. 

We have tnei several great 
thinkers along the way and pass 
on good wishes to writers who, in 
Ibe future, will be framing the 
minds of those who lo acquiesce 
their viewpoint. 



Ten tips for taking finals 

We, at The Communicator, wanted to offer some of our 
best advice when it comes to taking finals, so here goes it: 



( 1 ) Be prepared for any 
thing — thai includes 
memory lapse. 

(2) Talk the subject over with 
a classmate — it helps lo 
get other points of views 
and gives you a better 
understanding. 

(3) Ask your professors ques- 
tions, they are there to help 



(6) 



(7) 



(4) in, 

don 

everyone around you 

immediately starts wriling 
when they receive the blue 
books, Chances are their 
answer will not be concise 
but rather a garbled mess. 

(5) Study often and all the

(10) 



way up until the last 
minute — it helps. 

By this lime we are all sick 
of sludying. but you must 
keep the end in sight, so 
just do it. 

If unsure of an answer, 
B S. your way through it. 
It is belter than nothing 
and you might surprise 
yourself. 

Drink lots of coffee 

Avoid sludying in a Comfy 
place — such as your bed. 

When it is all over — 
smile. Whether this puis an 
end to your first semesler 
here, or to your last, you 
have accomplished what 
you set out to do.

An open letter to administrators: 

How to improve student /campus involvement 



To the editor: 

We, sludents at IPFW, would 
like to address the issue of student 
involvement on campus. We feel 
even though we are a regional cam- 
pus of IU and PU, the issue of stu- 
dent involvement should be taken 
more seriously. IPFW needs some 
changes to help initiate this. 

We, as a group project in our 
communication class, have talked to 
the athletic departments. Student 
Advisory Board, fraternities, and 
sororities on campus lo get their 
views on this subject- 
All groups have tried on 
numerous occasions to stimulate 
student involvement with little or 



no success. 

They are convinced most stu- 
denls are noi interested mainly 
because a .large portion of the stu- 
dent body is made up of part-time 
and older n on- traditional students. 

They feel that our sludeni union 
is not user friendly and that IPFW 
has a loi of bureaucratic obstacles, 
such as the lack of student dorms on 
campus, lo overcome before any 
major changes can occur. 

We feel that unless a few major, 
and minor, changes are made, stu- 
dent involvement cannot be 
achieved. Some changes we 
recommend are: 

(1) More siudenl input as to bow 



involvement can be achieved and 
should be initiated. 

(2) Evenls that appeal to more 
people in general, possibly hav- 
ing a "fair" of events to 
draw more participation. 

(3) The student union definitely 
needs lo be made more user 
friendly. The bookstore could be 
incorporated within the same 
building. Also, the idea of an 
express Taco Bell, Burger King, 
or McDonald's could be built 
within the student union to keep 
students on campus during breaks 
and meal times lo achieve more 
student interaction. 



(4) And lasi but not least, ihe avail- 
ability of student dorms. We believe 
university loyalty and involvement 
generates from dormilory living. 
Without it, student involvement is 
harder to achieve. 

We feel thai unless the adminis- 
tration addresses the student 
involvement issue with some of 
these changes, organizations with 

the university will always have poor 
student involvement no matter how 
hard they try.

No place for superstition in religion 



in and 
day out we are 
constantly bom- 
barded with sit- 
uations that can 
be perplexing. 

Just 
recently, a few 
friends and 1 
were discussing 
life and how we 
handle uncertain situations. 

As I talked about something that 
had happened to me that day, one of 
my friends asked me when my birth- 
day was. I told her, and she said, 
"Oh, so you're a Capricorn then. 
Today your horoscope said that 




'Work goes quickly, hut be wary of 
an untrustworthy Libra ihat will 
cause you troubles.'" 

I was taken back that she was 
actually serious. As we continued to 
talk, I began thinking about a friend 
who wanted lo read my palm aboul a 
month ago. Al first 1 decided lo be a 
good sport, bui didn't really think 
much aboul it until I really began 
pondering how many people rely on 
horoscopes, larol cards, psychics, 
palm-readings and the such (o get 
them through their lives. 

I couldn't imagine living a life 
based on predictions I read when I 
wake up in the morning or what a 
card turned over by chance says. 



It amazes me how many 
pie looking for some son of'guid- 
ance turn to unstable, unreliable 
things. Somehow I have been 
lucky enough lo be iniroduced to 
something thai is always trustwor- 
thy and solid: Jesus Christ. 

I sincerely pray for these people 
who turn to superstitions and psy- 
chics for guidance, I know that there 
will never be a time that these prac- 
tices will ever have anyihing lo truly 
back them up. I guess that's why I 
don't understand why so many peo- 
ple believe in them. 

My life is full of obstacles jusl as 
much as everyone else's; however, I 
have found someone to share my 



burdens with, and through Him, I 
have the guidance I need. I don't find 
myself looking toward things thai I 
consider "empty." 

These superstitions and psy- 
chic things are very misleading 
and are jusi another way ihat peo- 
ple reach oul for help. It's just very 
disturbing ihat some reach out in 
all the wrong directions. 

With this, 1 simply pray for 
true guidance for those Ihat are 
allowing "empty" things control 
their lives and hope that eventual- 
ly they will be able to turn to Jesus 
as a teacher and friend so that iheir 
lives can be as fulfilling as He 
wants Ihem lo be.

Changes I'd like to see in the world 




There 

are a number 
of things that 
I think would 
make Ihe 
world a better 
place. While 
some of these 
suggestions 
seem quite 
cliche, they 

are nonetheless sincere. 

I don't pretend lo have the 

answers — jusi some suggestions. 

What follows are the changes I 

would like to see. 

(1) Anyone who would start some- 
thing like this and nol begin by say- 
ing "world peace" is on a road lo 
nowhere. 

(2) An end lo racism, sexism and 
homophobia. 

(3) An end lo homelessness, but in 
the narrow view that it would never 
end, I want to see people change their 
views aboul the homeless as being a 
worthless, wandering people. 

(4) I would like to see people 
care more aboul others and have 
their actions demonstrate that 
care. 



(5) For people to dress like they did 
in the 1800s every now and then for 
no reason. 

(6) For people lo kiss each other on 
the cheeks when greeting. 

(7) For people lo ride horses more 
ofien as a form of transportation. 

(8) For everyone lo vow not lo go 
lo work for (al least) jusl one day 
a year. 

There is power in numbers 
and if we all do it there will be no 
consequences lo pay. 

(9) For rude people lo shut up more 
often, no one likes a pretend know- 
it-all cocky person who never has 
anything good to say. 

(10) For graduate schools (all 
schools in general) not to make 
grades seem like the end -all -be-all 
of asiudenl's life. 



(14) For people (o be more honest 
about their lives. There may be 
things you regret having done and 
are ashamed of, but undoubtedly it 
has contributed to the person you 
are loday. 

As long as you have bettered 
yourself, don'i be ashamed of your 
life mistakes. 

(15) An end lo pornography. I am 
not for censoring, 1 jusl think it 
would be great if people did noi 
wanl to look at pornographic 
material. It is demeaning to the 
human race. 

(16) For people to challenge 
themselves more and to confront 
their fears. 

(17) Compromise, yet know when 
to be smart enough lo realize when 
no compromise is in sight. 



(11) Gun control 



(12) For people to have belter en- 
queue. 



(13) For people to be more open- 
minded. 



(18) That liars be exposed. 

(19) I would like people to be able 
to distinguish between those who 
"claim" to be leaders and those who 
really are leaders. 

Finally. I would like lo see 
these changes implemented. 
Hey, it could happen.

The philosophy of choosing the right major 



Laiely

is so difficult 
ld^ V for me to select 
* a degree pro- 
gram. Maybe 
it's due lo 
"What are 
YOU going to 
be wben you 
grow up. young man?" gnosis still 
haunting me from my childhood. Or 
maybe I jusl want to avoid majoring 
in something that I might bate 10

just over-obsess about it and end up 
psyching myself out so much that I 
reson 10 driving 10 McDonald's and 
asking a clerk if they have any 
Prozac shakes. 

I've given the subject so much 
ihoughi that I've devised five theo- 
ries on why people choose the 
majors thai they choose The first is 
the "Theory of Money" 

We've all heard it "I'm going 
into — ology because I can make 
oodles of money when I graduate " 

In fact. I'd be willing to guess 



that this ihoughi has entered the 
minds of almost every college •in- 
dent on the planet 

Some follow through with this 
Iheory and go on to enter high-pay- 
ing professions that require a great 
deal of knowledge in certain sub- 
jects, and that also provide crucial 
societal services. Others, while pos- 
sibly enticed by the promise of 
money, cither use the first theory in 
conjunction with one of the other 
theories, or rely on a different theo- 
ry for totally separate reasons 

The second theory is ibe 



Letting go: Jeremy tcenbarger 



Editor learns valuable lessons 









As the 

spring 
semester slow- 
ly draws to a 
close, it is time 
to look back 



and 



bid 



farewell 

Life is 
touched of 
adventure, yet 
also full of disasters. It is all these 
things brought together thai make 
life worthwhile We leam from 
every experience we lake pan in 

Throughout this year, lime 
management has been the key to 
success in my life At Ihe beginning 
of each week, it seems that I open 
up my planner and schedule the 
week's events. I seem to allot exact 
times for certain things 

Let's face it, I may nave high 
enough grades and have money in 
my pocket, but where does leisure 
lime fit into all of this? 

Last weekend, I decided to go 
on the verge and take a break. I 
ripped the page from my planner, 
crumbled it in my hand, and threw 
it over my shoulder. I neglected my 
responsibilities and let loose. 

Yet, as Sunday came upon me. I 



came to the realizauon that maybe I 
was taking life a bit too seriously. 
When all along I thougbl maybe I 
was taking it too lightly Docs it 
ever even out? 

For so long, the newspaper 
has been my life When my 
friends called, I brushed them off, 
yet I found pleasure in my writing 
accomplishments. 

I was more worried about the 
petty arguments going on in student 
government than the ones that were 
happening in my own life 

While I was spending hours 
looking at pages flashing upon the 
computer screen, I lost one room- 
mate, probably three close friends 
and the respect of many people 
whom I looked upon as meniors 

When 1 threw my responsibil- 
ities aside this weekend. 1 man- 
aged to do the same thing While 
I was out enjoying myself and 
living on a whim. 1 turned away a 
friend in need, missed a wedding 
and allowed my answering 
machine lo overflow with mil- 
lions of voice messages. 

So, once again. I am left with 
that overwhelming feeling of 
guilt. As if the word FAILURE 
has been permanently engraved 



upon my forehead. And, like 
many limes before, I say lo 
myself, "Tomorrow is anoiher 
day." 

Each day. I strive to please 
everyone. However, like anyone 
else. I know 1 cannot. So. even 
though 1 have made mistakes and 
am perfectly conscious of them, I 
try not lo let Ihem weigh me 
down. For many days, it seems 
like the burdens of the world have 
been laid upon my shoulders. 

So. as 1 say good-bye to The 
Communicalor. 1 do not wish to 
leave on a sour note; (hat would 
be selfish of me. 

I would, though, like to apol- 
ogize to all those I have offended 
1 jusl want to say sorry lo those I 
yelled at and criticized, those I 
never gave a chance to. and lo 
those 1 just told to f-k off. And 
then. I wish to thank those who 
put up with mc to the end. 

Every experience teaches us a 
lesson. Being editor of a newspa- 
per has been a position full of 
endless research. 

I appreciate ihose who have 
listened, encouraged and partici- 
pated. It's been an assignment 
worth finishing. 



"Theory of Shame " 

How many limes during your 
life has someone asked whether 
you're attending school? 

Quite a few. probably 
Therefore, ihose who follow this 
iheory have gotten so disgusted 
from people asking ihe above 
question, that they reach ihe point 
of feeling ashamed if they're not 
attending school. So they choose 
any major in order to gel a little 
peace. 

Personally. I'd like to note 
that people who don't auend 
school are just as important as 
those who do. so STOP BADGER- 
ING YOUR FRIENDS!!! 

The third Iheory is the "Theory 
of Love." 

The people in this category 
choose a major based on what 
they've been passionate about their 
whole lives. "I've always wanted lo 
be a doctor" or "I've always wanted 
lo be a lawyer" are examples of

statements from this bunch I'm 
envious of people like this because 
they can plan tbeir MO further in 
advance than losi souls like me 

The fourth theory is the "Theory 
of Pressure " 

These unfortunates have chosen 
a major based on either whal a par- 
ent or another guardian figure wants 
them to choose. So much pressure is 
put on Ihe student to be like mommy 
or daddy that they eventually crack 
under the strain and give in to their 
demands 

This technique loses effec- 
tiveness as the student gets older 
and is better able to stand up for 
bis or her beliefs. 

The final Iheory is the "Theory 
of Disgust" 

Many older students experience 
this effect. They become so mental- 
ly or physically tired of their current 
occupation thai they realize paying 
to gel educated into a different pro- 
fession isn't such a bad alternative 



after all 

Also included in this category 
are people whose expenses have 
risen due to having kids or other cir- 
cumstances; and rather than work 
two jobs to maintain a certain 
lifestyle, they opl for temporary 
poveny in order to obtain future 
monetary rewards (which connects 
them back to Theory #1) 

Now. this list is by no means 
conclusive Other factors have 
undoubtedly been ignored, albeit 
unintentionally I'm sure there are 
folks who have chosen majors for 
reasons other than what my list 
entails (I haven't ruled out the 
"Comet Controls" iheory). 

But on the whole I feel that I 
have presented a thorough 
account of the various motiva- 
tions of what makes people decide 
to follow certain courses of study 
Of course, that still doesn't 
explain why people want to 
become coroners.

Plogsterth series to present 
Janet Fish lecture at museum 




Double Rainbow 

Oil on CavaG by Janet Fish 



Saturday, April 26, ihe IPFW Plogslerth Fine 
and Performing Arts Series will present a lecture by 
contemporary realist painter. Janet Fish This lec- 
ture will be held at the Fori Wayne Museum of An. 

Janet Fish is one of America's most influential 
contemporary still- life painters of the 1960s and 
70s. She is often compared to Photo-Realist 
painters, because she can draw reflective qualities 
of glassware and does not use actual pictures to do 
so In order to get the perfect picture, she will spend 
her day rearranging objecis until it is "just right." 

Her paintings have been widely exhibited and 
are in deserving collections such as: The An 
Institute of Chicago, Indiana University Museum of 
Art. and The Metropolitan Museum of An in New 
York. 

One of her works. Morning, is part of the per- 
manent collection of Ihe Fori Wayne Museum of 
An. This painting dates from the 1970s and is a 
classic example of Fish's painting style 

Tickets for this event can be purchased in 
advance at the School of Fine and Performing Arts 
office, 481-6025. Admission is S5 for general 
admission, S3 for senior citizens and IPFW students 
and S2 for children under 12. 



Local bands thank tfte iojt 



In various ways, The Loft has 
been giving to the community. Now, 
three local bands are uniting in sup- 
port of the facility that has truly 
lived up to its slogan .an open 
space for free artistic expression. 

Strut Train, Hand-Tossed and 
Listless, all original local groups, 
are scheduled to present an all-age 
show on April 26 at 8 p.m at The 
Loft. The Loft is located at 1126 1/2 
Broadway (above the Three Rivers 
Food Co-op) in downtown Fort 
Wayne Admission is $2. 

All proceeds raised from the 
concert will be donated to The Loft. 
The Loft is a not-for-profit organi- 
zation which operates solely as a 
place where people have the free- 
dom to present different and unique 
forms of artistic expression The 
Loft came into existence as it is 
today in 1992. The Loft is directed 
by Terry Doran, a well-known area 



artist 

From an shows, like the Jusun 
Blessing Memorial An Show, to 
concerts and parties, The Loft has 
welcomed a wide variety of events 

Recently, The Loft featured a 
special program designed by local 
youths through Stop Child Abuse 
and Neglect (SCAN) and 
Independent Living 

The program, entitled A Day In 
My Life, chronicled the often hor- 
rific and heart- wrenching stories of 
Fort Wayne youngsters who have 
dealt first-hand with abuse, neglect 
and families torn apart by drug 
abuse Several local artists spent 
time weekly with those in the pro- 
gram in order to (each them video, 
photography and writing techniques 
to help them facilitate their personal 
stories. The project was funded by a 
grand from Arts United and the 
Lincoln National Corporation 

IPFW organizations such as Phi 
Kappa Theta and Delta Gamma 
have utilized the space for events 



such as their annual Halloween 
Party and Toga Party. 

"I feel this is the spirit of The 
Loft," Doran said of the event 
These kids are getting together and 
putting on a free show The Loft is a 
unique place that depends on this 
kind of spirit and ii would not be 
possible without the spirit (hat goes 
behind putting on shows. ..it is key 
to the survival of The Loft There 
are not many places where you can 
come in, share an idea for some- 
thing you would like to do and actu- 
ally be able to execute that 
idea.That's part of what makes The 
Loft so special." 

Strut Train can be described as 
100 percent groove. Listless as 
alternative and Hand- Tossed, a new 
group, has a funky, hip-hop flavor 

"We're looking forward lo this 
show," said Stmt Tram drummer 
Duane Alexander. "This is an 
opportunity for us to give back to a 
place that has done so much for 
other people."

"Lions and tigers and bears, oh 
my!" 

This Saturday, the Fort Wayne 
Children's Zoo will open its gales 
for its 32nd season. Last year. 
538,000 people visited the recre- 
ational park The zoo will open 
from 9 a-in. to 5 p.m. every day 
including holidays until Oct. 12. 

The mission of the zoo is to 
help people develop a better appre- 
ciation for animals, to encourage 
family fun in a natural setting, and 
to help save the world's wild ani- 
mals and wild places. There's fun 
for everyone. 

Sights in the zoo include: The 
African Veldt, the Indonesian Rain 
Forest and the Australian 
Adventure, among others. 

Rides include: pony rides, the 
1860 miniature tram, the dugout 
canoes, the endangered species 
carousel and the safari car ride. All 
rides cost SI. except for the pony 
ride, which is SI. 50. 

Along with a few new crea- 
tures roaming the area, small 
scenery changes seem to be (be big 
modifications 

"People won't even notice them 
(the changes)." said Jim Anderson, 
zoo director. 

The changes include tree par- 
ing, costing nearly S10.000, new 
landscaping, fencing, and addition- 
al park benches. 

"Two thousand people will sit 
on them, no one will notice." said 
Anderson. 

New animals this year are a 
pair of tiger quolls. The unique 
creatures are known in Australia as 
native cats, but they are marsupi- 
als The tiger quolls are located in 
the Australia Welcome Center 

"Again, it's built right where 
people mighi not even notice the 
change," said Anderson. 

Also, the Great Barrier 



Aquanum is being re -construe ted 
The five small exhibit tanks in the 
gallery will be replaced with 
twelve smaller tanks, which range 
from 100 gallons to one-gallon 
"jewel boxes" Creatures to be fea- 
tured include cowfish, lobster, sea 
stars, urchins, tangs and soft corals. 

According to Anderson, the 
aquarium backdrops were brought 
from Chicago. 

"It was a S35.0O0 improve- 
ment," said Anderson "1 think peo- 
ple will enjoy it." 

All funds for repairs of the zoo 
come from admission, food and 
gift sales However, all new sites 
are built with donations. 

On June 7. wanhogs will take 
their place in the African Veldt 
Construction is currently taking 
place near the miniature safari on 
the 22 acres of African grassland. 
Many people consider these ani- 
mals "the ugliest creatures on 
earth. " Nevertheless, Anderson is 
sure someone will gel a kick out of 
it. 

Admission is S4.50 for adults; 
S3 for children ages 2-14 and per- 
sons over age 60; and children 
underage 2 are free 

Also opening on Saturday will 
be the Jack D Diehm Museum of

mammals, birds, insects and 
marine life are displayed at the 
museum, which was dedicated as a 
memorial to Jack Diehm. who died 
in a car wreck. 

Located in Franke Park, the

Fraternity appreciated by community center 



Hope 



by Jay Benjamin Cucllar 
Staff Writer 



Every social Greek organiza- 
tion at IPFW likes to get their 
name recognized for the outstand- 
ing things that they do It is a high 
priority of these organizations to 
help their fellow man Pail of the 
goal is to help the members of the 
organization branch out not only 
on Iheir prospective campus, but 
also in their community. 

The members of Sigma Phi 
Epsilon Fraternity donate a day of 
their lives lo the Eucll A. Wilson 
Center, through a program. that 
they created called Together 
Everyone Accomplishes More 
(TEAM). The program was 
designed to show that a group can 
get more done than an individual 
can ever hope to accomplish 
During the day, the members of 
the fraternity help with various 
projects, such as, the clean up and 
beau lifi cation of the surrounding 
area This was achieved in numer- 



ous steps. First they cleaned the 
trash out of yards and streets Next 
they planted flowers and shrub- 
bery. Through all of these process- 
es, they were introduced lo many 
of the Center's members, which 
are mostly children 

"They got more done than I 
could have thought possible." said 
Shirley Woods. TEAM'S presi- 
dent, "The children enjoyed the 
day with the fraternity." 

Cleaning the streets and plant- 
ing shrubbery was not the only 
assistance received from the fra- 
ternity The members of the fraier- 
nity also answered any questions 
that the Center had about the new 
computer software that they bad 
acquired. They also played games 
with the children. 

This event was set up by Mary 
Brandt, coordinalor of Indiana 
Campus Contact. Events like these 
are set up to help out all of the par- 
ticipant, by enhancing personal 
development, developing leader- 
ship skills, raising self esieem and 
increasing pride. Sigma Phi 



Epsilon Fraternity, and the Eucll 
A Wilson Center are still looking 
forward to spending more tunc 
together 

Because of this service, on 
Monday. April 7. students and 
student organizations alike were 
honored for their outstanding pub- 
lic displays of service by the 
Indiana Conference Compact at 
the spring meeting of the Indiana 
Conference of Higher Education. 
The Conference was held at the 
Radisson Plaza &amp; Suite Hotel. 
located in Indianapolis. 

The Compact is an organiza- 
tion made up of 63 campuses 
around the stale The campuses 
included are not only slate 
schools, bul [hey also include the 
private schools This opens up a 
world of advantages to the partici- 
pants The mission of the confer- 
ence is to provide and promote 
public service opportunities for 
college students. The persons or 
groups chosen for this award are 
picked by their prospective uni- 
versity. The grounds for the deci- 



sion are as follows: being out- 
standing examples of dedication 
and the principles and objections 
that the Compact has set forth. 

The Compact was formed as a 
response to a challenge set forth 
from Governor Evan Bayh during 
his first Staie-of-thc-Slatc 
Address. The governor called 
upon the institutions of higher 
learning around the state to instill 
in college students "a sense of ide- 
alism and commitment 10 public 

According to Louis Galto, 
director of Compact, "Programs of 
this nature are a refreshing rebut- 
tal to those who characterize 
today's youth as the me' genera- 
tion In reality, those being hon- 
ored exemplify the collegiate ideal 
besl expressed in the words of 
Charles W. Eliot, the distin- 
guished American educator. 
which arc inscribed in the 
gates of Harvard University: 
'Enter to grow in Wisdom 
Depart lo better serve thy 
country and mankind.'"

Belly dancing: an art form, not just entertainment 




Gwendra Esslingler is a mem- 
ber of Troupe Selene of the 
Seven Seas." 

by Gregory Gochtov 
StafT Writer 

If you Ihink belly dancing is 
nothing more than a woman waving 
her belly in front of your face, think 
again! According to Leila Gamal, a 
belly dance teacher in South Bend 
with over twenty years of experi- 
ence under her coin belt, many peo- 
ple look down upon belly dancing 
as a provocative and sometimes 
sleazy dance and not as an art form. 

"We associate pelvic movement 
with sexual movement. Our per- 
ception of sexuality in Ihe West is 
not ihe same as in the East," Gamal 



said "Belly dance is a sensual 
dance that does celebrate sexuality, 
but in a sensual way. Our problem in 
the West is that we have difficulty 
differentiating between sexuality 
and sensuality and therefore think 
that the dance is purely sexual." 

Belly dancing started out as a 
dance for women danced by 
women. It is for any and all women. 
regardless of size and shape. It is an 
especially good form of exercise, 
even for women with back prob- 
lems, and it is a great muscle loner 
and cardiovascular activity. 

The an form is derived from the 
movements of the snake, which has 
been worshiped and revered in 
many religions, and in some, the 
animal of wisdom and hidden 
knowledge. The term "belly dance" 
was actually a misinterpretation of 
the original dance which was called 
' Rakshari," which is also the music 
used for that type of dance. 

In the 19ih century, an Egyptian 
dancer was commissioned lo per- 
form at a trade exhibition in Paris. 
People started calling her "Little 
Egypt." When asked what dance she 
had just performed, she replied. "A 
beladi " The term was wrongly 
translated as "belly dancing." 

Since women historically have 
done Ihis dance only for women and 
men were not allowed lo participate, 
men and boys took ihe custom a 
dressing as a woman and dancing 
Ihe dance in cafes. Thai is how it 
became a "stage dance." 

However, now ii is commor in 
ihe Middle East for men lo belly

is more forceful and virile and uses

Belly dancing is a dance of "iso- 
lation." ihat is, you must learn to 
isolate certain parts. Not as easy as 
it sounds. Like any an form, it

dancing can be a beautiful, hypnotic

Volleyball season over 

'Dons lose to Lewis in tourney 



by Scott Warden 
Sports Editor 

This might have been the first 
time that IPFW men's volleyball 
coach Amie Ball has been ai a loss 
for words, hut while trying to 
explain his team's season-ending 
loss to Lewis on Friday night, he 
jusi couldn'i find the phrases 10 
match up with his emotions. 

The 'Dons were ousted from 
the Midwesiern Inlcrcollegiaic 
Volleyball Association tourna- 
ment by the Flyers 7-15. 15-5. 
15-8 and 15-1. 

In 1 the first game, the 
Volleydons dominated It was 
among ihe best volleyball that they 
had played all season, but some- 
thing happened during the three 
minutes in between the first and 
second games. Something snapped. 

The Dons found themselves up 
4-3 in the beginning of the second 
game, but Lewis look charge as 
they scored nine-straight points. 
IPFW losl control of the game, but 
more importantly tbey lost control 
of the season. 

"The first game we didn't pass 
real well, but we were able to get 
away with it," Ball said "The first 
time we beat them (two weeks ago 
at Gates Sports Center) we hii 600 
in the middle, and I think that we hii 
.100 tonight." 

In the second, the potent 
offense which freshman setter Chris 
Gisslen ran so effectively in the 
firsi game fell apart. The 'Dons 
recorded 12 hilling errors and hit 
only 1 2 kills to give them a 000 hit- 
ting percenlage for the game. 

The key lo the second game, 
however was Lewis' ability lo frus- 
trate the IPFW hitlers The Flyers 
stuffed the Dons offense both liter- 
ally and physically as they record- 
ed seven blocks in the second com- 
pared to IPFW's zero in game iwo 

"Our blocking was huge 
tonight," said Lewis coach Dave 
Deuser. "Thai was probably the 



most dominant our blocking has 
been all season. Thai is really ihe 
only thing thai we worked on since 
they beat us two weeks ago. We 
watched hours and hours of tapes 
from lhat malch and studied their 
hitlers and it really paid off." 

Everyone was struggling, but 
everyone blamed themselves for ihe 
team's mistakes. They didn't blame 
Iheir tcammales. 

"I don't know what happened 
(between games)," said Gisslen. 
"We were playing fine, bul the next 
thing thai I knew, we were way 
down in game iwo. 

Everyone was passing fine, but 
I've goi lo make better decisions 
than I did and I've gul to be a 
smarter player than I was. They 
were gelling me the ball, but I've 
got to put ii where they've got a 
chance lo do something with il and 
I wasn't doing thai tonight." 

"I know that I was straggling," 
said fellow freshman Hector Solo 
"There's a possibility lhat we gol a 
Utile loo confident and took it easy 
during the second game." 

"It was just a total learn lei 
down," said Ball "I can't point lo 
one person, because I don't think 
that it was just one person. It was 
just the whole group 

We served well in the firsi 
game and when you serve well 
you're able to score some poinis. 
We were able to block some balls in 
ihe fust game, but after that we 
were like a sieve." 

The game was held in 
Memorial Coliseum, bul after Ihe 
first game you wouldn't have 
known it. 

If the Flyer fans didn't out num- 
ber those for IPFW. you wouldn't 
have been able to tell by the noise 
the two groups were making. 

In the from row of the arena sal 
two extremely vocal fans for Lewis, 
who single handedly redefined the 
term heckling as ihey frustrated the 
'Dons mentally 

"I think thai ihey got to Hecior 



a bit," Ball said. "Tbey gol lo me, 
but lhat didn't have anything to do 
with our passing or (Gisslen) set- 
ting the ball or serving the ball out 
of bounds. Thai was a non-factor " 

But il was a factor. After every 
bad pass by Solo or Brad Prieditis. 
or after every misplaced sei by 
Gisslen, the Lewis fans were there 
to get underneath Ihe IPFW players 
and into their heads. 

"They're out in the stands and 
we're on the court," said Solo. "I 
knew thai I was struggling a little 
bit, but ii does good for them lo 
just talk a little trash. It could 
either make you step up and play 
at another level, or il could do the 
opposite." 

"We've had it worse in other 
places," Gisslen said. "It was main- 
ly just one guy, and one guy can't do 
anything (o you. Pius, we're bigger 
(han lhat. Thai didn'l have anyihing 
lo do with our season being over." 

Gisslen and Soto know that 
iheir collective future is still bright 
as they have three more years lo 
shake this loss, but for seniors 
Prieditis and Mike Ter Molen. noi 
only is their season over, but so arc 
Iheir careers. 

"They are just going to grow up 
and get belter," Ter Molen said. "It's 
all part of the deal. You're going to 
be inconsistent when you're a fresh- 
man, and you have lo expect that 
when you have two young kids 
starling in key spots, bul ii's all part 
of the learning process for them. 

They have something lo look 
forward to and 1 wish that I did, but 
this is jusi a building block for 
Ihem. We had a great season. Il jusi 
ended poorly" 

The season had lo end some- 
lime. That's undersiood when you 
take the floor for the first match, 
but Ball is tongue-tied when try- 
ing to figure out why the season 
ended so prematurely. 

"We jusi didn'l execute," he 
said. "I don't know how else lo 
put it." 



Athletes in Action 



Baseball ~ 

On Saturday, ihe baseball 
learn split a doubleheader with 
Great Lakes Valley Conference 
foe Wisconsin-Parkside at IPFW 

The "Dons won ihe first game 
in a pitchers' dual 2-1. Dan 
Matthews gave up one run as he 
earned the victory for IPFW.

score tied ai nine in the top of the 
ninth, Parkside loaded the bases 
and cleared them with one swing 
of the bai. The grand-slam gave 
the Rangers a 13-9 win 

"In the second, n was just a 
matter of depth in the pitching 
staff," said IPFW baseball coach 
Tony Vitorio. "We scored nine 
runs, and we've got lo win thai 
game. Our pilchers battled their 
butts off. bul we don't have 
enough depth lo just stick some- 
one else in there just lo gel the 
job done, because we have to be 
concerned about the nexi day and 
who's going lo pitch."

Dons bomb Parkside 



by Scott Warden 
Sports Editor 

Ask any of bis players and 
they'll tell you that head baseball 
coach Tony Vitiorio is normally 
extremely intense. But on Sunday's 
16-3 drubbing of Wisconsin- 
Parksidc, the coacb sat in his dugout 
and kept relatively quiet. What did 
he have lo get upset about? 

After the Rangers loaded the 
bases in the lop of the firsl with only 
one out, il appeared thai the TJons 
were in for a long day. but as he did 
all game long, starting piteher Dave 
Ellis threw his way out of a jam. 

In the bottom of the first, center 
fielder Terry Johnson look the first 
pitch thrown by Parkside and belied 
it down the left-field line. Thai hit 
was a bit of foreshadowing, as 
Johnson went five for six with five 



RBI, two stolen bases and a double. 
The T)ons may have been shut 
out in the first, 
but their bats 
caughi on fire in 
the second as 
they scored five 
runs. Rico 
Martin led the 
way in the sec- 
ond with a home 
run lo left-center 
field. 

Martin 
didn't stop there. 
He hit another 
home run in the 
sixth as be 

tolaled Iwo for 

three in the game with two walks to 
go along with his four RBI and four 
runs scored. 

"He's had several days like

that," said Viitorio on Martin's per- 
formance. "His mentality of the 
game is tremendous, but we've gui 
to get him to be ready to play day in 
and day out. Not only for the rest of 
this season, but also for the next two 
years. If we get him to show up 
ready to play, he's going to be even 
more dangerous than he is now. He's 
got tremendous pro potential, but it's 
just a matter of him showing up 
everyday and us as coaches teaching 
him. If he dedicates himself to play- 
ing baseball, look out." 

Along with Martin's two home 
runs, right fielder Jim Knight also 
pounded one out of the park as he 
went two for four in the game with 
three RBI. 

In all, IPFW rocked the Ranger 
pitching staff for 17 hits including 
four home runs and three doubles. 

What did Vitiorio have to worry 
about? 

"I was laid back loday," Vitiorio 
said. "Whenever you start a new 
program, a lot of guys have trouble 
with thai intensity and energy, but 
once you continue the program and 
teach the guys that arc in it now dial 
intensity and energy and then bring 
in guys that fit into (hat style of play, 
you're going to see just a nice 
intense, energetic and confident 
baseball team. Some of the guys are 
still learning that, but we're going to 
try to bring in some guys that are 
really competitive and feisty. Just 
like me. The bottom line is that if 
you come out and play hard every- 
day, you're going to have some suc- 
cess. We're 21-19 right now, which 
to me doesn't mean a whole lot, but 
compared to the past it's a lot here. 
It's going- to be even better in the 
future." 

He sits in his dugout at the end 
of the game Calm and collected. 
How unusual. It must have been a 
good day. 




IPFW slugger Rico 
Martin shows off Ihe 
sweet swing that tilt- 
ed two home runs in 
Sunday's victory over 
Wisconsin- Parkside. 
Martin, who is a 
sophomore center 
fielder, went two for 
Ihree against Ihe 
Rangers.
