OPINION 



■ and mud-slinginn, the things that make wounds heal slowly. 

Charlie IT. ill and llallie &lt; |iin«nts are hardly new In sludenl noveininenl and 
their pri&gt;urjims should nol surprise anyone Trail has already armouneed thai lie 
will retain Bill Klward as sludenl body Ireasurer, the officer charged with 
.idiiiinislirinc the sludenl oelivity budget. 

Both Pratt and Clements have been heavily involved willi Die Ctmvncalions 
Committee and Film Series Committee If they retain their present eommittee 
assignments or even if they appoint others in their place, no substantial change in 
present policy is to be expected. 

The Sludenl Union Hoard will not i lianee niuel) eitln t with i hairinan Miebael 

' Yann's reelection to his fourth term on Ihe board. 

'■ ' The Student Senate will he mostly new faces, including 3 

. under the Johnson-Randall ticket Also reelected to the s 
and Hanst'hnstenscn.lwo leaders in Ihe previous Sei 
prove invaluable when the new senale gets going. 

Hiseasv to conyralidate Ihe winners hut hard to console Ihe losers As in past 
years some very e.o.nl candidates did not make it Hopefully , again .as in past years, 
these qualified non-winners will cuter student govcrnineul Ihmiip.h the appointive 
process. 

There has already hen talk that the lour losing candidates lor Sludenl Union 

Hoard (Hill Eubank, Kick Reeves, and Mike and T Koonl/.i will he appointed to 

Ihe board James Syers, Ihe presidential candidate who finished Ihird, will no 
doubt Slav on as chairman ol Ihe Joint Alhlelie Advisory loinmillce And such 
people as Tim McKntee, John Raiiserman, Dave Milliard, Ann Moilhorsl, and Untie, 
Ulmer, all qualified senate candidates who didn't quite make if, should all be 
offered positions. 

Mike Yann - - Mr. Durability 

Since Michael Yanu was elected loins fourlhterm on Ihe Sludenl Union Hoard, 
one can assume lhal Ins reelecliun reflects a general satisliiclion Willi pa si SI JH 

performance Although The Ci miuicalor has occasionally lakeu Yann to task lor 

some of his aci ions and policies, we have lo a ilm ire anyone with Ins staying power. 

This post year, Yann made sigiulicant slops to provide for more input into the 
selection of groups lined by SUH for concerts on campus and liopelully he will 
continue in this direction. IPFW is a growing university and (he quality of the 
concerts available on campus should reflect this growth. 

Although he and the. &gt;l her elected SUH members endorsed and campaigned for 
the Johnson lickel, Yann was one of Ihe fust to congratulate I'ratl Tuesday evening 
all er his victory. We feel he was sincere in this, and that spiril ol cooperation is a 
factor that can make sludenl government work in the year ahead. 

Asa Wise person once said. "Any Iriend you might lose over an election wasn't 
much of a friend in Ihe first place. "Michael Yann has come out ol this election with 
his integrity Intact.
