Worker finds human bone 



Nev/ major is a first 

Women's studies degree 
approved by the I.U. &amp; P.U. 



By Tina Holston 
Editor In Chief 

As women were banding together all 
over the United Slates in support ot the 
ERA amendmenl, reproductive choice 
through Roe~vs. Wade and as the 
nation began lo realize women's 
issues hold real polilical weight, IPFW 
championed these etfons ot the early 
1970s by establishing courses in Ihe 
field ol women's studies. Today IPFW 
is still championing women's issues. 

A major in women's studies has been 
added to the list ol degrees ottered at 
IPFW, The program is unique because 
it is the (irsl major lo be ottered Ihrough 
both Indiana and Purdue universities. 
Alter months ot rewilles and expecla- 
lions ol some resistance, the proposal 
was approved unanimousiy by both the 
Indiana and Purdue main campuses in 
August. 

"The adminisUalors decided this 
would lay the ground work tor future 
programs because it is interdisci- 
plinary." said Judy Dilorio, director ol 
women's studies and assistant profes- 
sor ol anthropology. IPFW has been 
planning to create a new curriculum 
which would otter many majors through 
either Indiana or Purdue. According lo 
the vice chancellor's office, this would 
allow students lo change their majors 
wiihoul switching lo the other school 
and having their core requirements 
changed too. 

Dilorio said the amount of scholarship 
by women, the number ot faculty and 
courses oilered in women's studies 
here, and the students' desire lor more 
in depth study ot women's issues have 
all been motivating factors in the deci- 
sion lo submit a women's studies 
degree proposal tor approval. 

Women's studies is a relatively young 
academic area. The tirsi women's 
studies courses were offered al U.S. 
colleges and universities in Ihe late 
1960s, and IPFWs program was a pio- 
neer in ttie Held otfenng women's stud- 
ies classes since 1972 and a minor 
has been available since 1977, accord- 
ing to Dilorio. 

'In the last two years there has been 
a dramatic increase, nationally, in Ihe 
number of women's studies programs.' 
said Dilorio. '1990 marked 20 years ot 
women's siudies and the lime has 
come* tor a program al IPFW, she 
said. 

The objective of Ihe new program is 
to 'provide a structured concentration 
tor undergraduates who wish lo pursue 
an interest in feminist scholarship in 
depth,' according lo the degree pro- 
gram proposal. Students will be 
encouraged to enroll in another major 
or at least a minor in another discipline 



in Ihe arts and sciences, said Dilorio. 
"Students will be admitted to the uni- 
versity (Indiana or Purdue) which hous- 
es their second major or minor." she 
said. 

According to the program proposal, 
"Twenty years ago. when the first 
women's siudies programs were being 
developed at colleges and universities 
in the United Slates, women's studies 
courses and feminist research were 
often seen as 'compensatory,' that is. 
as providing information and analysis 
lo supplement traditional curricula, 
which usually omitted women's 
achievements and concerns." Dilorio 
said that although she expected the 
proposal lo have a hazardous path lo 
approval, the program went through 
rather quickly. 

She said she believes most people 
today accept women's scholarship; 
and she did not expect lo run into prej- 
udice about women's studies. She 
said, "I'm happy to say that sort of 
question was never raised." 

Dilorio became visibly exasperated 
with the suggestion thai a men's stud- 
ies program could now be proposed. 
"Ali other siudies are men's siudies," 
she said. 'All other scholarship has 
proceeded as if women didn't exist." 

The proposal lor the program states 
that. "While women's studies courses 
may still have (a) compensatory func- 
tion for some students, the purely com- 
pensatory model has been superseded 
today. An extensive and complex body 
of theoretical and analytical feminist 
scholarship now provides the inlellec- 
lua! toundalion for bolh undergraduate 
and graduate programs in women's 
studies." 

"When people ask 'What good is a 
women's studies degree?' 1 say it's as 
good as any traditional liberal arts 
degree like history or philosophy, or 
sociology for ihat mailer.* said Dilorio. 
'Not all students are here to get a job. 
And career opportunity is not all there 
is to education or we would throw all 
these other majors out the door." she 
said. 

Despite increased enrollment in wom- 
en's siudies courses, enrollment in Ihe 
program is not expected to be high. 
According lo the proposal, projected 
enrollment and graduation rates are for 
len new students enrolled each year, 
with three graduating from Ihe program 
each year, Diloho said that estimate is 
based on how many students are cur- 
rently enrolled as minors in the pro- 
gram. Dilorio said she knows of two 
students who were planning lo leave 
IPFW lo pursue a women's stud- 
ies major elsewhere, but have now

Campus expansion projects meant lo 
bring IPFW into the future are also giv- 
ing the community a look at the past. 
Human remains were found Tuesday 
at Ihe site ot the new PIT theater con- 
Siructnn, 

A right humenjs, a human upper arm 
bone, was discovered when members 
ol the construction company working 
on Ihe building were digging a trench 
for a chilled-water pipe, according lo a 
campus police report. It is unknown 
whether the arm is Native American 
Indian or not, according to Robert 
Jeske, assistant professor of anthiopol- 

"There is a 7,000-year-old Indian 
campsite located in Ihat area ot cam- 
pus," said Jesite. "1 held an archeotogi- 
cal field school two years ago where 
we excavated that site. But it is also 
only about 200 yards away from an old 
cemetery once located here," he said. 
The student group found stone tools 
and debris from the Indian she during 
that summer's projecl. according lo 
Jeske, but no human remains were dis- 
covered. 

Jeske said two sites were also found 



on the old McKay farm kx:ated on the 
wast side ol SI. Joseph River across 
Ihe river from campus. The property 
was acquired by IPFW a few yeais 
ago. 

'We are holding another archeologi- 
cal lietd school this summer lor lurther 
excavation,* said Jeske. 'But we are 
concentrating on this side of the river 
first tiecause it's a better site.* 

A stale work farm was once located 
where the IPFW campus is today. 
according to Jeske. A chronological 
history ol Ihe IPFW campus grounds 
on display in Kelller Hall claims Iha 
larm was a self-sulticient community 
lot the menially retarded who were 
abandoned by their families. The farm 
housed and cared for the mentally 
retarded belore the Stats Developmen- 
tal Center was built on St. Joe Road. 

"The farm cemetery was moved and 
the bone could have been left behind 
from that,' said Jeske. 

For now Ihe bone is being kept by the 
anthropology deparlment at the 
request ot the Deparlment ol Natural 
Resources. After the discovery, the 
crew foreman of Weigand Construction 
Co., Ihe company contracted for Ihe 
new theater project, called the Indiana 



Department of Natural Resources, as 
required by slate law whenever human 
remains are discovered during con- 
struction oxcavallon. The DNR 
deemed the find 'an accidental discov- 
ery.' 

Jim Mohow, ol the Historical Consei- 
valion section of Ihe DNR, called cam- 
pus police to file a report and have 
construction work slopped unlil on-site 
examination ol the remains could be 
done. 

Jeske, along with William Baden, 
IPFW vax systems manager who has a 
degree in archaeology, and Larry Kuz- 
nar. associate professor ol anthropolo- 
gy, examined Ihe area and determined 
Ihat construction would nol impact the 
burial site, said Jeske. 'We have been 
authorized (by the DNR) lo monitor the 
work unlil construction is completed to 
ensure the (burial) site will remain 
intact,' said Jeske. 'Perhaps olher 
bones will be found, so we are holding 
oil shipment (ol the bone)," ho said. 
He also said Ihe slate will make the 
final decision ot what happens to Ihe 
bone, and anything else found, alter 
age and origin ol the artifacts have 
been determined. 



Student senate dispute settled 



By Jim Walker 
Managing Editor 

Alter a week in limbo, the student 
senate will be back in session tonight. 

The student senale did not hold its 
tegular meeting last Thursday night 
because it did not have a leader to 
open the meeting. The elected vice 
president ol student legislation, Lori 
Bishop, resigned Sept. 4 because she 
was not carrying a sulticient classload 
to serve in llie position. According to 
Ihe current student government consti- 
tution, a student must be regisiered for 
six hours or more to serve in senate 
positions. 

After Bishop resigned, questions 
were raised by Student Body President 
Kristina Frazier-Henry concerning the 
constitutionality of opening a senate 
meeting without the vice president of 
student legislation who is designated to 
preside over ihe meeting. According to 
Ihe constitution, a senate president pro 
tempore is to lake over in the absence 
ol the VEce president. But this year's 
senate never got around to electing a 
president pro tempore. So. Frazier- 
Henry asked the student government's 



judicial court to look into the case. 

Tuesday night, judicial court ruled 
that Frazier-Henry had the power to 
open the meeting herself. The sept. 17 
ruling reads: 'Pursuant lo the request 
of Kristina Frazier-Henry, president of 
Ihe IPSGA, regarding Ihe inability of 
the IPSGA senate to convene in the 
absence ol a vice president ol legisla- 
tion and senate president pro tempore, 
the judicial court finds the following: 
The IPSGA president, in compliance 
wilh the IPSGA constitulion (section XI. 
A. 3. e. and section XI. A. 4) is empow- 
ered to call and preside over a meeting 
ot Ihe whole IPSGA. The judicial court 
interprets this to include such items of 
business as are presently belore Ihe 



Frazier-Henry said she is happy lo 
have a ruling. 'My main concern is that 
I just wanted a decision, I wanted a 
final ruling so the senate could go on 
with its tile.' 

Now Ihat student senate can meet. 
Ihe lirst order of business will be the 
election ol a new vice president ol stu- 
dent legislature and a senate president 



pro tempore. Both of these positions 
will be held by current member ol the 
12-person student senate. 

'I'm not sure there is anyone on sen- 
ate now who understands Ihe role of 
vice president or who is qualilied to do 
Ihe job. They need to be responsible 
and committed lo the position," Frazier- 
Henry said. 

According to Frazier-Henry, at least 
four senators are interested In the vice 
president of student legislature posi- 
tion. One of Ihe interested senators Is 
lormer Student Body President Mark S. 
Snyder. 

With only 12 senators serving on a 
senate with 20 seats available, it would 
be possible lor a senator to be elected 
lo vice president with the support of 
only two or three other senators, espe- 
cially with four or more names on the 
ballot. 

This week's student governmeni 
meeting is slated lor tonight at 8 p.m. In 
Walb Memorial Union. Further infor- 
mation concerning the meeting can be

ed expressly for Hispanic students.

ents at the beginning of each school 
year.

awarded: divided inlo two scholarships 
ol $500 and Iwo of £300. The two

on unique requirements the winners 
agree to meet. First, they will attend 
weekly meetings ol Hispanos Unidos. 
IPFWs Hispanic student union. Sec- 
ondly, they participate in a new higti 
school on-lrach program sponsored by 
IPl^: 'Making it Happen.' 

"In Making it Happen,' Hispanic stu- 
dents from IPFW will meet with local 
Hispanic students from the high 
schools to discuss and inform them 
about higher education opportunilies,* 
said Maureen Reidenbach, counselor 
lor Hispanic students at IPFW. 

The talks will be informal and In 
small-group setting. "Making it Hap- 
pen* is modeled after a similar program 
created to target local African-Ameri- 
can students called, "Mastering the 
Possibilities,* which, Reidenbach 
added, has been a success. 

Donations lor Ihe lirst Amigos schol- 
arships came pnmarily (rom private citi- 
zens. Efforts are being made, howev- 
er, to bring mora corporate and civic 
groups into the fold for next year's 
scholarships, with an eye toward more 
and larger awards. "We wish lo garner 
contnbutions from a wider segment of 
the community,' said Reidenbach. 

"The purpose of the Amigos Scholar- 
ships is promoting Hispanic students' 
education on a continuing basis, ' Rei- 
denbach slated. 'By letting them know 
Iheir education is imponant. they can 
turn around and help other students 
pursue theirs."

Government 

Student senate needs 
serious shaking up 

Somelhing must be done abojl sludonl sonale. There are cutrently 12 sludenl 
senators repiesenting, supposedly, the views ol more than 12,000 IPFW slu- 
denls. This tiny laclion ol sludenls should nol be able to reprsseni Iha studsnl 
body even 11 it could do so lairly and objectively. And the group undoubtedly 
should nol represent the student body as senators when Ihey are in ollice (o pur- 
sue only sell-Interests. This is the case with our current senate. 

An example ot Ihs aclivities ot our sellish senate was noticed last week. Tlie 
picnic lables that once sal In grassy areas near the river on campus were moved 
to the cement area in Iront ot Helmke Library. These lables. which were donated 
to the student body by the student government last year, were relocated by mem- 
bets ot student senate. The siudent senators who moved these tables now sit on 
them and smoke. It these sludenl leaders had the interest ol all students in mind 
they would have left the tables in the grassy locations instead ol moving them to 
serve theif own sell-intetesls. 

This Is just a smatl-scale example ol the sad stale ol our student senate. In the 
past. IPFW's student senates have budgeted money tor the organizations they 
were Interested In or involved in. The senate has given large amounts ol money 
to groups that don't serve the interests ol Ihe student body white balking at lund- 
Ing lor needy groups who would. No matter what group ol students makes up the 
sludenl senate, Ihe structure ot the government is conducive to corruption. 
Somelhing must be done. The current siudent senate is clearly thriving in a cli- 
mate ol corruption. 

Pan ot the problem could be eased by lilling Ihe eight vacancies on student sen- 
ate. The conslilulion ot the sludenl government calls tor 20 sludenl senators. 
But Ihe current body ol senators seems to want to stay small. Of Ihe tour stu- 
dents who tried to petition on lo student senate this tall, only one was voted in by 
If^Jlhe seriate body. Two ol the three sludenls retused seats on senate were gradu- 
;^'i ate students. The other was a senior at IPFW. 

These students each galhered 50 signatures Irom IPFW students and met the 
qualilicalions lo become senators. But they were voted down. 

II seems that any IPFW student who can meet the qualilicalions should be 
allowed lo serve in government. Why not? There are eight empty positions. 
Why would they be retused? It's simple, the pelilioners did not lit in with the sell- 
ish plans ol the currenl senate. 

Instead ol having a cross sampling ot student representation on sludenl senate, 
we now have a selective group ol senators who can pick and choose new mem- 
bers. The students government doesnl allocate lunding to traternities and sorori- 
ties because they are groups that teature 'selective membership.' The student 
senate should cut its own lunding and shut down now because il is a group made 
up by selective membership. 

The student senate should be reconstructed to better serve the views ol the stu- 
dent body. The senate should not be able to wield any power without the backing 
of Ihe siudent body. Remember, this senate was voted in by less than one per- 
cent of our siudent body in the last election. 

With the silualion right now, student senate should be closed down and a new 
election should be held. II students doni come out to the polls in a higher per- 
centage this time, then siudent senate should be eliminated as a controlling body. 
If students want their money spent their way then they should be able to vote 
directly on the budgeting ol lunds. 

IPFW students cani sH back and lei an elitist group ol bone heads control our 
lunds. Somelhing must be done.

Lehers To The Editor 



Feedback 

Student blasts Communicator content 



To the Editor: 

1 am writing this 'Letter to Ihe Editor" 
in response to Ihe 'Features' article by 
Chad Nesting. 'A night from hell ■ Ten 
things I learned in Indy strip clubs" fea- 
tured in The Communicalor during the 
week of Sept. 2. 

To lollow your paltern, Mr. Hesling, 
here are 10 things that I learned from 
your article: 

Thing ffl - Thef,e are more errors 
in The Communicator this year than 
ever before, including one in your own 
article (Thing #4 - ...Ihen hold (sic) his 
face up ,..") Who, if anyone, proofreads 
tor Ihis paper? 

Thing #2 ■ You have stooped to a 
new low in order to gain a) lame b) 
notoriety, c) response, or d) who knows 
what? 

Thing #3 ■ Nol only was Ihe humor 
in Ihis piece at junior-high level, but 
you even attempted to cover this up 
with a lew strategically placed vulgari- 



ties and crude little rationalizations; 
such as Ihe lact thai one can be 
"annointed' in a strip bar, 

Thing #4 - The same issue of The 
Communicalor mentions the 55 per- 
cent female population at IPFW. Is 
your anicle intended to be relevant and 
welcoming lo this majority by being 
embarrassing, belittling and patriarchal 
towards them? 

Thing #5 - Why the booming 
silence in response to this article? 
Surely someone at IPEW must have 
some opinions on this piece? 

Thing #6 - Mr. Hesling, you men- 
tion in "Thing #7" that "we rolled drunk- 
enly down 1-465 .... to Indy's southeast 
side ,,,, Sounds tike a plug far driving 
drunk lo me. Is there anyone out there 
who is M.A.D.D. about this? 

Thing #7 - H this article is tongue- 
in-cheek." please inform us how big a 
mouth one must have in order to get a 
live-lool tongue back inio it. 



Thing S8 - On second thought, I 
think we can all see that longue still 
sticking out at all ol us. 

Thing fl9 - Even your linaJ admon- 
ishment. 'Don! Go,' was loo litlle. loo 
late to redeem this article. 

Thing #10 - Finally, Mr, Hesling, 
are you aware that last year our stu- 
dent government decried discrimination 
in any lorm on Ihis campus? People 
like you, who choose to rely on stereo- 
types, obscenities, and making light ol - 
exploitation of women should be 
denounced not only by our student 
government, but also by the student 
population in general. 

I lirmly believe in First Amendment 
rights. The majority ot the Supreme 
Court, in Near vs. Minnesota (1931) fell 
that Ihe First AmendmenI was 
designed to 'prolecl speech that some 
people condemn as garbage." I per- 
sonally polled male and lemale stu- 
dents lo lind out. though, what they 



thought atMUl Ihis article. Commenls 
ranged from 'shocking, disguslirifl, 
inappropriate" lo 'oul ot place, irrele- 
vant, boring and finally, 'Oh well, what 
do you expect, it's only The Communi- 
cator." 

I do feel that there are much more 
imponani issues on this campus which 
should take precedence here, such as 
sludenl safety and the lack ot police 
personnel,' as mentioned by Mr. Snyder 
in The tpommunicalor. Sept. 12, 19S1. 

This newspaper also slates, in that 
same issue, "this newspaper is Ihe 
medium thai could possible (sic) reach 
everyone on campus. ... The funding 
lor this paper comes from the student 
aciivity fee sludenls pay each 
semester.' Mr. Nesting, our studeni 
population, University, and community 
deserve belter than this.

Student questions Snyder's 
true intentions in senate 



To Ihe Editor: 

I picked up The Communicator Iha 
other day and turned lo the editorial 
page. To my surprise and dismay. I 
discovered thai not only is Mr, Mark 
Snyder still here, but he is still loud. I 
mean, seriously, what does this guy 
want? 

I was uninformed about Ihe campus 
police issue and I'm glad thai he 
broughl Ihis to lighl. I was not 
pleased, however, lo hear about his 
moral outrage. 

Please. Mr. Snyder, are we sup- 
posed to take you seriously? Is this 
the Mark Snyder who lied so blatantly 
to the student body? What does he 
want his time around? Rumor has it 
that Mr Snyder wants to be vice 
president ol siudent senate. Can you 



believe the nerve of this guy? 

What makes you tick, Mr. Snyder? 
Is it the power involved? If that is Ihe 
case, you might talk to Ihe Democra- 
tic party. I hear they need a presi- 
dential candidate. 

We're always going to be told that 
we need lo express ourselves and 
get involved in campus activities. I'm 
expressing myself now. I dom irusi 
Mark Snyder, and I doni want him to 
be vice president ol sludenl senate. 

Senators, il you are listening to the 
voice ol your constiiuents, ytJu'll 
know that many people leel the same 
way I do. It il comes to a vote in 
yonighfs meeting, please vote, NO.

Rejected student questions integrity of student senate 



To thB Editor: 

I vfouk) liko lo publicly apologize to 
every sludenl who signed my pelrtion 
lor sludoni senate this surr^mer. It 
seems Ihal regardless ol the fad thai I 
met every single requirement pre- 
scribed In Ihs student government con- 
stitulion, as have another graduate stu- 
dent and a senior undergraduate. I am 
nol worthy of being voted on by present 
senate members. Or. is it that Ihere are 
|ust enough sludenl senators collec- 
tively intimidated by one former student 
body president's insecurity and intellec- 
lual myopia that any lime an individual 
ol substantive quality and objective 
thinking petitions for a sludenl govern- 
ment seal Ihey will be denied. 



I need mention where this honorably 
discharged, degreed, former Marine, 
received the inspiration to become a 
student senator, tt began on page 1 1 ol

Throughout the last several days, I 
have been approached by more than a

I have a lew simple things lo question 
about the IPFW parking system lor Ihs

1, Why would anyone pul handi-

expect the handicapped to hhchhike to

3. Why are there pa(king meters in

Talk on homosexuality to be

TolheEdllor: 

Tonight [Thursday, Sept. 19) at 7:30 
in Nell Room 370 (note room change). 
I will give a talk, sponsored by the Psy- 
chology Club, tilled "Homosexuality, 
Hetetosexualily, and the Brain." I hope 
lo provide Ihe background inlormalion 
necessary to understand Ihe recenl 
linding thai a particular region in the 
brain is larger in heterosexual than in 
homosexual males. Unfortunately, 
many of the posters announcing this 
talk have been delaced or removed, 
probably tiecause the word 'homosex- 
uality" appears on Ihem. This is remi- 
niscent ol the removal and defacing of 
posters announcing the showing of 



"The Last Temptation of Christ" two 
years ago, an event also sponsored by 
Ihe Psychology Club, It is unfortunate 
that soma "sludents" at IPFW feel so 
threatened by the free exchange ot 
ideas and information that Ihey seek to 
censor any presenlalions that (might, 
for they do not know the content of my 
talk) depart from their narrow view of 
the world. I guess now the word is out

andoppoMunHies.' 

So reads Ihe mission slatemeni ol 
United Hispanic-Americans, a Fori 
Wayne organization created lo serve 
Ihe needs ol local Latinos. For 20 
years the UHA has oXered an array of 
programs (or Ihe enrichment ol Indiana 
Hispanics. 'More Ihan ever we've 
been working with the community lo 
encourage Hispanics to achieve a 
diploma, gain a trade, get educational 
training ... bring lo Ihem more chances 
(or a betler life,' said Jorge Suarez. Ihe 
executive dlreclor ol UHA. 

UHA was founded in 1971 as Uniled 
Mexican-Americans, The llrsi mem- 
bers were all Mexicans, joined by the 



opinion that no ch^ic organization in Ihe 
city addressed Mexican needs and 
concerns, said Suarez. The first Iwo 
programs established by the group 
were Ihe Job Search referral service 
and Ihe Youlh DevelopmenI program. 

As Ihe group evolved, new programs 
were added. The Bilingual Community 
Oulreach program was established to 
assist Hispanics searching lor housing. 
The program helps prospeclive home 
buyers with applications for govern- 
ment benefits. A drug and alcohol 
counseling program was Ihen added, 
then a food bank was established. 
Suarez said, 'The programs have been 
implemented in the same way. We 
create a new program, then work on 
the success of thai program before 
thinking about another." 

In 1991 United Hispanic- Americans 
have a long list ol achievements. 
According to Suarez, ihe UHA is a 



kxjse conglomeration, wiih many help- 
ing hands involved. A core ol lour slali 
members, a nine-member board ol 
directors and 25 regular volunteers 
keep UHA an oiled machine. In one 
year (1989). 103 persons found full- 
time employment Ihrough Job Search 
relerrals, 90 enrolled in a program on 
evening classes providing citizenship 
education, 111 people loined the UHA 
Family English Literacy program, and 
the aforementioned Bilingual Commu- 
nity Oulreach program aided 268 His- 
panics wiih housing concerns. All told, 
6.000 persons contacted UHA for 
assistance. 

Still, UHA volunteer Hector Tuesca 
feels the organization has achieved a 
goal that reaches beyond service pro- 
grams. *l( I had to prioritize, I think 
they've been important in uniting he 
Hispanic community, and also in show- 
ing people thai Hispanic-American 
doesn't mean just Mexicans . . il 



means all Latinos. Irom Mexico to 
Argentina.' 

Suarez concurred, "It's Ifue, Hispank: 
forces cannol be ignored anymore, 
here or nationwide.' 

When asked what problems Latino 
men and women lace. Suarez had an 
immediate answer, "Discrimination, 
it's Ihe real challenge,' he said. He 
offered employment and education as 
Iwo arenas where the hurdles are most 
formidable, 'WeVe heard Ihe phrases 
many limes...'Jusl nol college, or high 
school material' or 'lacking leadership 
potential.!' 

Lack of lormal education, loo, is a 
stumbling block for Hispanics, Job 
Search statistics show that 65 percent 
ol those ashing for relerral assistance 
havem finished high school. It is also 
true thai relerral applicants may be 
well-skilled in his or her trade, yet lack 
a GED or certification of I 



The picture may be changing for U.S. 
Hispanics. Cities Ihe size of Fori 
Wayne across the nation can and do 
suppon groups like UHA. The 1990 
census estimated the Hispanic-Ameri- 
can population to be near 22 million 
persons, a number that's dillicull for 
policy makers lo ignore, 

UHA is by delinition an apolitical 
organization Registering voters is as 
close to poliiics as ihe group will ever 



come. Yet. Suarez showed obvious 
pleasure in telling how Hispanic politi- 
cal siatus is changing, "11 you recall 
the'as election, both Bush and Dukakis 
had to come to the Hispanic voters. 
Also, the Hispanic vote in New York 
City lipped Iho scale for DavkJ Oinkins 
in the mayor's race, he sakj,' 

Suarez leaned back in his chair, lilted 
his chin upward, and said, *Yes. we 
have been ignored. But we can't be 
ignored anymore.'

Don't worry aboui buying "Roll the

you 



from 



"Presto" lo your big brother's worn 
"Moving Pictures" LP lo WXKE's copy 
of 'Fly by Night," Ihe lasl known lo slill

The hype put out by Atlantic Records 



for this one is that this is Rush's "pop' 
record. 'Best songwriting to date ... 
Beauiilul ... Melodic' gushes their 
press release. 'Best songwnling in a 
looong time,' drawls Buzz on WXKE. Il 
isn't. The boys in the band ate loo 
busy worrying about being great musi- 
cians to make good songs, take Ihe 
single 'Dreamline.' Alex Lileson's 
plunking guitar rhythm plays under- 
neath the verse until Ihe chorus. Then

insert a two-measure drum fill before 



Women's Studies continued from page 1 

decided to slay. 

The program is innovative, according 
lo the proposal, because il takes an 
inletdisciplinary approach, H introduces 
gender as a lundamenlal category ol 
analysis in women's studies, and it 
requires students to develop a themat- 
ic focus ol study. 

An inlerdisciplinary major is one 
which requires courses from at least 
two departments. The women's stud- 
ies major requirements are nine hours 
of women's studies courses including 
W210, W301 and W400. and 21 hours 
of cross-listed courses in at least three" 
differeni disciplines, including six hours 
in Ihe humanities or line arts, six hours 
of social sciences and sciences, and 
nine hours of elective cross-listed 
courses. 

At least three of these courses must 
form a thematic focus lor study, 
according to Ihe proposal. "The pur- 
pose of the thematic locus is lo provide 
coherence within the inletdisciplinary 
concentration ... and could be broadly 
or narrowly delined in a variety ol 
ways: geographically, chronologically, 
or by a category which applies lo sev- 
eral historical periods and/or cultures.' 

Now that Ihe major is approved, Ihe 
department is focusing on hiring a new 
director and a new lull-time faculty 
member. According to Dilorio, "Piiorily 
is being given to hire a director who will 
hold a joint appointment. We are look- 
ing for someone with established 
seniority in history or political science." 
She said by finding a person with 
eslabtished seniority from anolher col- 
lege to come in and take over, the 
statute of the program would also be 
raised. 

'I would be happy to step down tor 



HOME EQUITY 
SPECIAL 



someone with that kind of experience," 
said Dilorio. 

The program currently has nine full- 
lime and four part-lime faculty mem- 
bers. Ol the 13 laculiy members, iwo 
are women's studies teachers only, 
while Ihe remaining 11 hold (ull-lime 
appointments in other departments. 
Those 11 faculty teach women's stud- 
ies focused in Iheir area of expertise. 
The women's studies program faculty 
represent academic areas ranging 
Irom philosophy, psychology, and soci- 
ology to nursing, communication and 
modern foreign language. 

IPFW's mission, according lo the 
1990-91 Builelin, is to provide quality 
education above all else. The new 
women's studies major seeks to 
achieve a similar, yet more far reach- 
ing, goal. Il slates. "It (women's stud- 
ies major) enhances the quality of the 
undergraduate education by providing 
students with the opportunity lo pursue 
feminist scholarship and grow both 
inlellectually and personally. Although 
such scholarship offers theoretical, 
empirical and methodological insights 
of significance to the intellectual and 
personal growth of students, it has 
ye) to be fully incorporated into tradi- 
tional curricula."

It was Too hot lo think, let alone run. 
But run they did. 

The men's and women's cross coun- 
try teams participaled in the Taylor 
Invitational Saturday. The men lin- 
ished 12lh out ol 14 teams while Ihe 
women's team placed 11th in Ihe 14- 
team field. 

Head coach Dave Neely said the 
heat dominated Ihe day, 

'We ran prelly well considering the 
conditions." he said. "The heal was a 
major laclor. It was 98 degrees on Ihe 
lield thai day. People were passing 
out left and right.' 

Freshman Sam Nolan led the men's 
leam in the 8,000-meter race with a 
lime of 2S minutes. 34 seconds: good 
lor 30lh place overall. The winning

IPFW soccer coach Troy Rushing 
was looking for more scoring punch 
this season, and he seems to have 
found it in Ihe lorm of sophomore Neil 
Bogenschutz. 

Bogenschulz's lirst-hall hat trick led 
the 'Dons to a 6-0 victory over cross- 
town rival Indiana Tech, on Sept. 11. 
Freshn.an Ryan Hayes, Jason Pleitlec 
and Andy Carr all tallied alter Bogen- 
schutz lo round out the Mastodons' 
scoring. 

The tables were turned lof Ihe 'Dons 
on Sunday, however, when Ihey laced 
the Universily of Wisconsin-Parkside 
on the IPFW campus, 

Tom Czop led the Rangers lo a 4-0 
win when ho scored goals two minules 
apan in the lirst hall. Chris Ryan con- 
vened a penalty kick lo give UW-Park- 
side a 3-0 haltiime lead. Corey Hanes 
wrapped up Ihe scoring, talleying wilh 
just seconds remaining in the game. 

"We camp gut a little flat,' said assis- 
lant coach Mark Colfee 'They were 
able to keep the ball in our end most of 
Ihe game. We still need some experi- 
ence.' 

Rushing agreed. 

'We have so many freshman,' he 
said, 'Our inexpenence showed,' 

The Ranger's Joel Meadow was 
required to make just one save lo post 
the shulout. UW-Parkside oulshol Ihe 
'Dons 19-S. 

IPFW (reshman netminder Hagen 
Lyle made 10 saves and was scored 
upon for Ihe first time this season.
