IPSGA has new Student Body President 

Interim President brainstorms 




Jerry Richardson, Interim President for IPSGA. Pholo by D 



byJoAnnSleinforlh 
News Editor 

Jerry Richardson, former vice 
president of legislation of 
Indiana-Purdue Student 

Government Association, look 
over as interim student body 
president on Feb. 3. 

Although he admitted he knew 
of the possibility that former stu- 
dent body president Rajat Suti 
might not be reluming prior to 
Fcb3, Richardson docs not have 
any formal policies in place. 

"1 am in a transition phase • a 
brainstorming phase, but will be 
having the same priorities as 
Raj," he said. 

Suri officially resigned on Feb. 
3 in a teleconference with 
Richardson, four other members 
of student government and 
Marian K. Zimmerman, IPSGA 
adviser. 

"We feci very good about what 
Raj accomplished while he was 
IPSGA president. One of the first 
bills to be passed under this 
mil. urn presidency will be a bill 
renaming our office as ihe Rajai 
T. Suri meeting room," said 
Richardson. 

Richardson discussed issues 
facing studenis on the IPFW 
campus. 

On parking: "Parking is a 
short-term issue and with a new 
science building being proposed, 
there could be a possible tuition 
increase," said Richardson. 

The University Resources 
Policy Committee is addressing 
future parking options. 



"The committee is looking at 
the possibility of allowing stu- 
dents who don't park on campus 
to not have to pay for parking. If 
the administration decides to 
have a new parking garage, the 
parking fee will double. We are 
not looking forward to this," said 
Richardson. 

Richardson says he is glad the 
URPC is looking into the park- 
ing situation and states he will 
probably appoint Mark King, 
vice president of legislation, as 
The senate representative. 

His leadership style is to 
encourage other people to pre- 
sent their own issues. 

"I want to provide an environ- 
ment where other people can 
work on their proposals. I can't 
work on every issue," explained 
Richardson. 

Elections are currently sched- 
uled for March 21-25 for stu- 
dents interested in any position. 

"There are 20 senate seats 
available at any given time; ibis 
has disappointed me throughout 
my time in office," said 
Richardson. 

Richardson hopes candidates 
who do not win in the upcoming 
elections will still get involved 
as senators. 

On office furniture: the IPSGA 
office received new furniture. 
"Funds came out of the student 
government office budget from 
last year. The money was sei 
aside, a lot of il was left over," 
said Richardson. 

On IPSGA Salaries: Ours is 
one of the few campuses where 



executives of student govern- 
ment arc paid. "We are paid up 
lo 15 hours apiece at a rate of S5 
per hour. Administrative hours 
are paid by Purdue, but come out 
of student activities fees. 

On posting official legislation: 
There is a bulletin board outside 
the student government office 
located in Walb 225. Richardson 
says he will continue with previ- 
ous policy and post resolutions 
that have been passed by the 
Senate. 

"The toughest problem is com- 
municating with the student body 
- it is a difficult task," said 
Richardson. 

On Financial Aid for new 
organizations: Organizations 
interested in seeking aid from 
student government have guide- 
lines they must follow, that are 
explained in the financial guide- 
lines passed- in November. 
Interested panics must first make 
initial contact with the Senate 
and explain their proposals in 
detail to 1PGSA. Richardson 
staled there is a SI ,500 limit for 
aid. 

"We are trying to make student 
government more fiscally 
responsible by working with 
interested organizations. 

"Most organizations come to 
us with good events," said 
Richardson. 

Richardson is a junior major- 
ing in Political Science who has 
been involved with IPSGA for 
three semesters and will run for 
president in the upcoming 
elections. 



URPC starts master plan 



bv Linda Oliver 
Chief Reporter 

As IPFW changes, problems that 
arise with larger enrollments need 
to be resolved. At the Feb. 1 1 meet- 
ing of the University Resources 
Policy Committee, members dis- 
cussed future campus expansion. 

Walter Branson, vice chancellor 
for financial affairs, presented a 
packet of master plans from other 
campuses. He suggested that they 
could be used as a model of ideas 
for IPFWs 25-Year Master Plan. 

In order to formulate IPFW's 
plans for expansion, the committee 
will invite experts from other col- 
leges and universities to discuss 
campus architecture of the future as 
well as provide input on a starting 
point for IPFW. 

The concept presently under dis- 



cussion is not only to have the 
buildings blend in with the current 
surroundings but also to fit into the 
scenery- of the future. 

Scott F. Argasi. chair of gco- 
sciences, asked Jack Dahl, registrar, 
if he felt any uneasiness about pur- 
suing the Master Plan without a 
new chancellor on board. 

"No." replied Dahl. "Assuming 
even a 12-month time span, there 
will be time for the new chancel- 
lor's input." 

Linda Wootton, committee chair, 
closed the meeting after all agreed 
they would like Branson and Dahl 
to keep (hem abreast of plans 
before decisions were made. All 
members indicated they were will- 
ing to meet more often to discuss 
upcoming issues concerning the 
Master Plan.

IPSGA President seeks to 
make new appointments 



by Linda Oliver 
Chief Reporter 

Taking a quick, firm hold of the 
reigns, Mark King, new vice presi- 
dent of legislation, opened the 
weekly meeting of Indiana-Purdue 
Student Government Association at 
noon Monday. 

Present were Jerry Richardson, 
new student body interim president; 
Chris Douse, senator; Kevin Allen, 
senator; Amy Steenman, senator; 
Jeffery Veldez, senator, and Marian 
Zimmerman, dean of students and 
IPSGA Adviser. 

Douse asked the committee to 
allow die judicial court to check out 
the matter concerning the old 
appointments that were made by 
former IPSGA President Rajai Suri 
who resigned Feb. 4 by fax from 
his home in New Delhi, India. 

Before a ruling is made regarding 
any new appointments Richardson 



might make as interim president, 
Douse said he wants the court lo 
prove that there are no under the 
table dealings. 

Richardson read from students' 
government rule book to show he 
could make new appointments 
under the circumstances of his 
interim presidency. 

Douse stood by bis motion to let 
the judicial court decide if there is a 
discrepancy in Richardson's rea- 
soning for wanting the old nomi- 
nees out in order to make room for 
the new appointments. 

In other business, Amy Steenman 
was appointed in charge of Pro 
Temp. 

Nominated and approved to the 
election board were J.C. Osbom, 
Andy Baxter, Tim Sappcnficld. 
Ann Theresc-Petcrson, Jake Taylor. 
Mclinda Heller, Josh Clark, Tony 
Romano, and Rick Mills.

sponsors 

meeting on 

National 

Exchange 

Program 

Out-of-state study 
program offered 

by Jo Ann Steinforlh 
News Editor 

Student Academic Counseling 
Services is sponsoring an infor- 
mational meeting on the National 
Student Exchange program on 
Monday, Feb. 21, at noon in 
KctUer Hall, Room 108. 

Laura Hcrbrand, associate 
director and NSE coordinator at 
IPFW, says students attending 
the meeting can become aware of 
the opportunities the exchange 
program has to offer. 

The exchange program offers 
IPFW students a chance lo attend 
other colleges throughout the 
United States, as well as Puerto 
Rico, Guam and the Virgin 
Islands, without having lo pay 
out-of-siate fees. 

Students participating in the 
exchange program pay IPFW 
tuition rates, remain eligible for 
financial aid, and receive transfer 
credit towards IPFW degrees. 

NSE qualifications state the 
exchange student must be full- 
time at IPFW and have a mini- 
mum GPA of 2.5. Any major 
will be considered, and married 
couples are eligible.. 

The application deadline for the 
1994-1095 academic year is 
extended to March 1 If any inter- 
ested student cannot make the 
informational meeting, they can 
contact Hcrbrand directly in 
KetUer HOE. 

"This is a wonderful opportuni- 
ty for students at a commuter 
campus to get away and try 
something different," said 
Hcrbrand. 

Maureen Voors, a junior major- 
ing in Environmental Studies, 
participated in the student 
exchange program. She spent a 
year studying at State University 
in New York, 

"The benefit of this program is 
the money you saved from the in- 
state rates. Its more than just 
going away to college," said 
Voors. 

"You work with a coordinator 
who invites you to parties, 
movies and other events," said 
Voors. 

The program is currently in its 
26th year and has been available 
at IPFW for 22 years.

The Communicator 



STAFF EDITORIAL 

Something in the 
milk ain't white 



This year the city of Fort Wayne is celebrating its 200th 
bicentennial and next Monday the nation will celebrate the 
birthday of George Washington. Yet, as citizens of Fort 
Wayne, have we taken out lime to fully understand what it is 
that we are celebrating? 

Are we rejoicing and celebrating the fact that Native 
Americans were robbed of their land? Are rejoicing the fact 
that we took away peoples' homes and culture? 

Are we as citizens of Fort Wayne celebrating the fact that 
George Washington sold people as mere cattle? Are we 
proud of the fact that he participated in raping people of 
their culture and their bodies? 

The realities and facts of what has occurred in the past are 
not always comely, but the truth still remains in the fact that 
if we do not learn and understand our past, WE ARE 
BOUND TO REPEAT IT! 

Unfortunately some will state, "Well that was how it was 
back then." Is this supposed to excuse people's behavior, 
because slavery was legal then? Whether it was legal or 
"socially acceptable at that time, does not justify the act of 
owning another HUMAN BEING! 

Let us stand candid in the information and "history" that 
we choose to highlight in our newspapers. Reality lies in the 
fact that, Anglo-Saxon white Americans came over and basi- 
cally destroyed the Native Americans' culture and now have 
gracefully given them reservations. 

It appears that as citizens of Fort Wayne we have chosen 
to have a SELECTIVE MEMORY and recall certain aspects 
of history that we feel are suitable or proper to highlight in 
this city. 

Shouldn't we instead be celebrating or giving notice to 
the Iroquois Confederacy of Nations? 

A huge contribution towards the United Slates 
Constitution was given by this same Iroquois Confederacy 
of Nations. 

Just in 1988, has Congress entered a resolution that recog- 
nizes the contribution of the Iroquois Confederacy of 
Nations. 

Why should George Washington, a person who participat- 
ed in the selling and profiteering of other human beings, 
continue to be celebrated as a great figure in history? 

Perhaps, instead of telling history the while way rather 
than the right way, we should give credit where credit is due.

SOutZtJrCVup^s, 




A voice from generation X 



by Edward Granzella Jr 
Sta IT Columnist 

I really warned lo make il lo the 
end of [he semester without feeling 
obligated to respond to a letter criti- 
cizing one of my columns. 
Unfortunately, my column about a 
course I took last semester. 
Psychology 120, didn'l sit too well 
with a group of professors in ihe 
psychology department. They 
expressed their dissatisfaction quite 
well in a letter lo Ihe editor the fol- 
lowing week. 

I want to apologize lo Dr. Craig 
Hill, my instructor in that course, 
for any discomfort I might have 
caused him because of ihe column. 
1 had absolutely no intention of crit- 
icizing his leaching methods, intel- 
ligence, or integrity. The only crime 
Dr. Hill is guilty of is having me in 
bis class. It might very well have 
been any other psychology profes- 
sor. I can only attribute the misin- 
terpretation of my column by (hem 
and others that 1 bave spoken with 



to my lack of writing ability and 
misuse of satire. Again, I apologize 

and have learned a valuable lesson. 

Well, it's that time of year again - 
Income lax lime. You need lo pay 
your fair share so the brain trusts in 
Washington and Indianapolis can 
spend it for the good of some peo- 
ple, namely, themselves, their rela- 
tives, and their friends. A lot of 
people delay doing their taxes until 
the last second because it's incon- 
venient or they don't want the 
bloodsuckers to gel their money 
any sooner than necessary. While 
those are valid reasons, there is a 
good reason to get your taxes done 
this month - college financial aid 
for next year. 

Last year, I made the assumption 
that the new Free Application for 
Federal Student Aid would put me 
on the desiring list for all types of 
financial aid available since filling 
il out was a long and less than 
enjoyable process. 1 found out, after 
certain deadlines, that this was not 



the case. So, I missed out on a gram 
that I had received the previous iwo 
years. College financial aid is one 
of the few cases in which you can 
actually see Federal and Slate tax 
dollars working lo help you. if you 
qualify. Don't be afraid to ask for 
and take college financial assis- 
tance. You're most likely going to 
pay it back laier tenfold. 

All right, here's the game plan. 
First, do your federal (axes. You 
don't have to send your return in, 
but you must use accurate dollar 
amounts. Then get and fill out the 
Federal Student Aid form. Here's a 
trick - if you are required to declare 
your assets, pay off all your bills 
and get your cat that operation 
you've been thinking about. 
Basically you want to reduce the 
amount of money you have on 
hand. It also helps to fill out the 
form right before you get paid. 
Don't lie! But the less money you 
have, ihe greater your need. Send 
the completed form in by March 1, 
1994. This is a deadline for state 



student aid. Don't limit your oppor- 
tunities. 

Another form to check into is the 
Special Programs Application. If 
you're even close to qualifying for 
any of Ihe programs on the form, 
fill it out. The form is available 
from (he financial aid office. As a 
final note, if on your financial aid 
award letter, you have an unsubsi- 
dized Stafford loan, you should 
seriously think whether you really 
need the money. Interest will 
accrue while you are in school leav- 
ing you with a major bill if you 
don't make interest payments prior 
to graduating. 

In an ideal world, I would hope 
higher education would be free. 
The benefits of post-high school 
studies are well documented. 
Unfortunately, a college education 
isn't free - far from it. Any little bit 
of assistance helps. Take it. if you 
can get it.

A Dose of Douse 

Student needs to emancipate mind 



nfllvd. 



After reading ihe letter to the edi- 
tor from Larry Gwaltney in the Feb. 
10 issue of The Communicator, I 
felt the need to comment on several 
of his arguments because I think he 
fails to realize how he benefits from 
being a while heterosexual male. 

In addressing the issue of color, 
he fails to realize that there are sev- 
eral privileges that he receives from 
being white. Let's lake the short list 
for instance: 

1. White men do not have to 
worry about being followed in 
stores. 

2. While people always have a 
positive role model in the media. 

3 White people have always ben- 
efited and continue to benefit from 
the contributions of African- 
Americans and other people of 
color. 

4. While people are not always 
asked to condemn or explain an 
issue dealing with their own ethnic 
group as African-Americans are. 

5. While people are not always 
under constant criticism of why 
they feel as ihey do regarding cer- 
tain issues as African Americans 
are. 

And the list goes on. 

To me his writings suggest he 
would be the first person to tell 
someone he is not prejudiced or 
that his best friend is black. 

As far as the reference of Jesus 
being a man of color. Christ was 
not despised and rejected for his 
color, he was merely as depicted as 
a man of color in a passage of the 
Bible. 

Plus, if you look at the geographi- 
cal location of the Biblical birth- 
place of Christ. I find it quite hard 
to believe that Jesus was a white 



man with red hair, lily while skin, 
and of course blue eyes. That is a 
white man's perception. 

As far as mentioning Anita Hill, 
the writer states. "You see, it 
doesn't matter if she lied or not, 
because now we're educated as to 
what sexual harassment is. The 
hapless writer should understand 
that Hill merely makes it popular to 
claim harassment, which is not the 
same thing." 

Number one: it does matter if she 
lied or not because of the negative 
effect it has on the image of 
African- Americans in this country. 
What people fail to realize is that 
tbe Anita Hill case was one of the 
highest-rated television shows next 
to the Cosby Show. 

African -American people do not 
air their dirty laundry in public. 
They never have. It has never been 
in our nature to do things like thaL 

If you look at the case, why 
would an educated African- 
American woman all of a sudden 
come forth during a supreme court 
nomination and claim sexual 
harassment against an African- 
American man? 

Most people believe Anita Hill 
came forth. 

I don'l. I strongly believe the 
Aniia Hill case was an instance in 
which the government and media 
both leaked out the information and 
presented it in a public forum 
instead of a private one. 

It was a case in which, after the 
information was leaked. Hill had to 
defend herself in the best way pos- 
sible. Her defense was sexual 
harassment. Sure enough, they 
spent lime together, but I don't 
believe it was harassment. I believe 



there was an ongoing relationship 
which should not have taken place 
between a supervisor and an 
employee. 

As Hill discussed Thomas' allu- 
sion to the information of pubic 
hair lying on a Coke bottle and 
mentioned ihe pom star Long Dong 
Silver, the attitudes of the senators 
and media towards her continued lo 
reinforce the stereotype of African- 
American women as being whores 
and sluts. They would have never 
spoken to a while woman as 
aggressively, especially if they 
respected her as a woman. 

The discussions of Long Dong 
Silver and pornography continued 
to degrade the African-American 
male by alluding to ihe myth of 
black men having abnormally large 
penises. 

As the curtain falls America once 
again shows her ass by continuing 
to disrespect people of color, partic- 
ularly African -Americans. 

For the writer lo say lhat Hill 
merely makes it popular for people 
to claim harassment suggests lhat 
she came forth with ihe information 
for economical reasons. 

He fails to realize lhat no mailer 
what the circumstances of the Anita 
Hill case are. sexual harassment 
was finally forced inio society as an 
issue of importance lo not just 
women, but everyone. 

The writer states thai his "objec- 
tion to same-sex adoptions is less 
concerned with the replications of 
homosexuals ( as real as that possi- 
bility is) than is with producing 
unfortunates who wriie silly editori- 
als for their school paper" 

This statement saddens me 
because it shows how people con- 



tinue to project their own personal 
demons on lo olhcr people because 
their opinion is different from the 
so called status quo. 

What this writer also fails lo real- 
ize is that by throwing out insults, 
condemning people on the basis of 
their sexual orientation, and not 
agreeing with another person's 
opinion he continues to promote 
and stimulate the most unique qual- 
ity America has: the ability to dis- 
criminate against anything ihai is 
different. 

I listen to how people are just 
jumping up and down over the 
movie'Schlinder's'List and how 
good it is. How horrible the 
Holocaust was and such. Yet they 
fail to realize that just as many 
human rights violations happened 
in the United States during the so- 
called "discovery" of this country 
by the enslavement of African and 
African- American people as well as 
during receni incidents such as the 
exposure of radiation to pregnant 
women, young mentally disabled 
children, and prisoners. But, we 
can't talk about it because it is in 
our own backyard. 

Until Mr. Gwalmey realizes that 
be is participating in the hype, divi- 
sion will continue to eat this coun- 
try up like a cancer. The only thing 
division does is prevent the people 
of this country from addressing the 
issue. 

I feel the bsue should be treating 
and accepting everyone as a human 
being Now. doesn't il say some 
place in the Bible, do unto others as 
you would have them do unto you? 

Or is that a different book ?

Commentary 

Covert 
racism 
addressed 

by K.iiiiTi.i Mcgown 
Editor in chief 

Recently. 1 had Uic opportunity 
to have a brief yet startling con- 
versation with a Mr. Ernst 
Zundell, He is a member of a 
group that is involved in the 
Revision of history. Mr. Zundell 
and his oiganization requested to 
advertise their information in the 
The Communicator. Zundell was 
extremely upset with the 
film'Schindlcr'sList." 

Zundell also expressed to me 
dial the movie was not a correct 
representation of what really 
occurred in the Holocaust. . 

When asked whether or not if 
those incidents that were depict- 
ed in the film were correct. 
Zundell responded by saying that 
it not only was an unfair repre- 
sentation of the Holocaust but 
that it did not occur like most 
historians state. 

Throughout the conversation. 
Mr. Zundell assumed thai I was 
not African -American. I chose to 
inform Zundell of this when the 
conversation ended. Of course, 
he was surprised and somewhat 
embarrassed. 

The entire incident made me 
more aware of the fact that 
racism is very much alive and 
"kicking." I then found myself 
questioning how many people 
are members of the group but 
also aiding in its funding. 

The frightening aspect of Ihe 
entire situation lies in the covert 
racism that remains hidden. 

When one faces their enemies 
head-on, diey know where they 
stand with them Only then are 

they able lo deal effectively with 

those persons.

You didn't 

hear it from 

me, but... 

by F. Lane Douse 
Features Editor 
You didn't hear it from me but I 
need to address the attitude of a cer- 
tain waitress at a certain restaurant in 

Ramona, the editor In chief, and I 
went out for dinner Monday night. 
We chose Mexican rood. Anyway, 
the waitress had the nerve to card my 
girl talking about how she wants to 
be sure she's legal. 

Now I don't have a problem with 
being carded. You have to be sure if 
you are in that position. What I had a 
problem with was her attitude when 
Ramona told her she had graduated 
from Canterbury. 

Well, Miss Thing came back and 
asked mc what school did 1 graduate 
from. So, I told her I graduated from 
Snider which is true. 

Do you know what she had the 
nerve to do? 

She huffed at mc as if I was some 
type of snob or something. So, I'm 
thinking to myself that maybe she's 
having a bad day. It could happen. 

Anyway, we order and Miss Thing 
comes back with our food. So, we're 
sitting there talking and eating when 
I notiocd my glass of Sprite was 
empty. 

Ten minutes pass before she 
returns. So, I shook my glass as If 
I'm shuffling the ice around trying to 
get her attention indirectly. I don't 
like to tell people how to do their 
job. 

Do you know what she had the 
nerve to do7 

Let me tell you what Miss Thing 
did. She walked over to the table and 
said, "Let me fill your glass, since 
you shook it to get my attention." 

Now, I'm thinking to myself, she's 
acting as if she doesn't want to get 
tipped which is essentially what hap- 
pened. She got a 52 cent tip for her 
time and service. Crappy service, 
crappy tip. 

She's lucky I didn't speak to the 
manager.

School of Fine Arts, the School of 
Engineering and Technology is

course for IPFW students. The 
department of Landscape 
Architecture at Purdue is also par- 
ticipating in this course. 

"As far as I know, this is the only 
foreign study course initiated on our 
campus," said Matthew Kubik, 
associate professor of architectural 
engineering Icchnology. 

This is the third year IPFW has 
been a part of the program. 

The class is listed under ARET 
499 and F1NA P495. Rome Italy; 
Architecture, Art and Urban Form. 
It is scheduled to run from June 9 to 
June 22. 

The course can be taken as a non- 
credil or for three credits. 

Insturctors for the course are 
Matthew Kubik, Robert Zahri, and 
SamanthaBirk. 

Kubik is an internationally trained 
architect who has lived in Rome.

of education for the Fort Wayne 
Museum of Art. 

Besides lectures from local 
experts, students will receive addi- 
tional instruction from other recog- 
nized international authorities in die 
areas of archaeology and art history. 

Kubik feels this trip is a great 
opportunity for students lo really 
broaden their horizons. 

"Last summer twelve students 
traveled to Rome," he said. "One of 



our students, Dawn Dykes, was vis- 
ited by two of her new Italian 
friends. They stayed for a month." 

The trip is for any person with an 
interest in art, architecture, land- 
scape, interior design, history, 
archaeology, or urban planning. 

The cost of this exciting course is 
$2,249 for traveling. Tuition costs 
are S288 for Indiana residents. 

"The problem is that since this 
course is registered through West 



Lafayette Study Tours, il does not 
appear in any of our IPFW course 
schedules," said Kubik. "The dead- 
line for deposits is March 1." 

If any students are interested, 
please contact Kubik at 481-6797, 
by Room 229 in the ET building.

Men's 

volleyball 

recap 

Friday, February 11, 1994 
Hllllard (iates Sports Center 

The Indiana-Purdue Fori 
Wayne men's volleyball team 
took another step in providing 
their dominance in the midwest 
as they defeated Midwest 
Intercollegiate Volleyball 
Association foe Quincy 
University 3-0 in NCAA vol- 
leyball action Saturday night in 
Fort Wayne. 

The Volleydons used all 14 
players to improve to 3-0 in the 
MIVA. 6-2 overall, in the 60 
minute match with Quincy. 
Felipe Ralat (Jr., Ponce, Puerto 
Rico) led the Dons with 7 kills 
in 9 attempts, followed by a 
career high 6 kills by Mike 
Termolen(Fr., Grand Rapids. 
Mich.) Steve Simonsen (Sr., 
Racine, Wise.) led the Dons 
with 14 assists, as season best 
effort for him. 

IPFW will put iLs conference 
leading record on the line next 
Saturday night (Feb. 19) as 
they travel to Columbus, Ohio 
to battle arch-rival Ohio Stale. 
The Buckeyes ended IPFW's 
hopes of reaching the NCAA 
Final Four for the third straight 
lime last year, and IPFW seems 
focused on another great 
match. 

Saturday. February 12, 1994 
Hllllard Gates Sports Center 

Setter Lloy Ball (Sr.. 
Woodburn. Ind.) tied a career 
high with five service aces as 
the #5 IPFW Volleydons 
improved to 5-2 on the season, 
2-0 in the Midwest 
Intercollegiate Volleyball 
Association, in a men's college 
volleyball game on Saturday. 

Wisconsin-Milwaukee, who 
fell to 4-5 on the season and 1- 
3 in the MIVA, showed well in 
game two as they pulled to 
within oiie point at 12-11, but 
two Loly Ball jump serves 
quickly gave IPFW the win. 
Nick Momcilovic led 
Wisconsin-Milwaukee and all 
players with 14 kills. 

IPFW will be back in action 
tomorrow night (Sat., Feb. 12) 
at 7:30 as they hosl Qunicy
