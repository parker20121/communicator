The Army Officer 

'Citizen-Soldier' 

1775-1976 

(A Bicentennial Look At Army ROTC) 

At the onset of the Revolutionary War, the militia in the colonial army were no 
match for the British Regulars. The Americans were a ragtag multitude of 
disorganized, restless men. Leadership from militia officers was virtually 
nonexistent. Because of the lack of uniforms it was impossible to tell the officers from 
the enlisted men. In short, there was chaos. 

The Second Continental Congress then chose George Washington as 
commander-in-chief of the troops. His first course of action was to dismiss unqualified 
officers, enlist the cooperation of the militiamen and train them properly. 

A training program was set-up under the direction of Friedrich von Steuben, a 
German who had been a captain in the Prussian army. Washington appointed him 
Inspector General. Von Steuben gained the respect of the men and trained them in the 
proper use of weaponry and m il itary tactics. Officers as leaders of these 20,000 strong 
were trained in troop utilization and concern for the well-being of enlisted men. 

After the war, men like Thomas Jefferson and George Clinton suggested to 
Washington that proper training of officers for the Army could be accomplished by 
having one college in each state responsible for officer training. After graduation 
these trained men would be commissioned to serve for a short time and then join a 
standby pool of officers. 

This concept was presented to Congress but not acted upon. 

In 1819, Captain Alden Partridge took Jefferson's ideas and made them a reality. 
A former superintendent of West Point, Partridge founded the American Literary, 
Scientific and Military Academy in Northfield, Vermont. There, students received a 
liberal arts education combined with military studies. 

By 1862, the trend toward college-educated Army officers was formalized in the 
Land Grant Act (the Morrill Act), which made military training compulsory at all 
colleges built on public lands. 

The National Defense Act of 1916 created the Reserve Officer Training Corps. 
With the passage of this law the Regular Army, the National Guard and the Army 
Reserve were merged into the Army of the United States. 

Since that time, Army ROTC graduates have answered the call to lead our country 
in times of war and peace. Today, more than 70 percent of the new Second 
Lieutenant's who enter the Army each year come from ROTC

Some may argue that abnormalities can be 
caused by environment factors and they are 
right. But when do these factors occur? 
According to the book "Anatomy and 
Physiology" Vol 2, p. 255-256 under 
"Acquired Abnormalities" it reports evid- 
ence that these occur mostly from the 
second thru the eight week or pregnancy.

"Pooper" here has been spending 
a lot of time with The Communicator 
lately. And in comparision with the

stop by Suite 215 of the Union and ask 
for Tim Ducey.
