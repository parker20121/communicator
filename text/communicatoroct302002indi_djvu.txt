Voting system contains flaws 

Voting machines have been corrupted 



Edilor's nol^ The following arti- 
cle contains excerpts edited 
from a news release by Bcv 
Harris. It is meant only to edu- 
cate and jnfonn, not lo discour- 
age anyone from performing 
their civic duly to vote T\jesday, 
Nov. 3. 

Thirty-one city newspapers 
have documented r 



s that o 



□ the 



ballot-stuffing, dead-people- 
voling. hide-the-ballots-io- 
your-trunk, absentee-faking 
problems of the past. The rash 
to computerized counting, and 
the consolidation of Ihc "voting 
machine industry" into (USt 
tfuec major players, who trv lo 
keep identities secret, fail to 
mention conflicts of intcresl and 
shrug off criminal records has 
added new worries about the 
security of our voting process. 

Among Ihc programming 
errors reported: Automatically 
forgetting lo count 41.000 votes; 
misprinting ballots designed for 

unreadable; machines counting 
25 percent more voles than vot- 
ers and computcriied counters 
inexplicably reversing the tallies. 
The problem is, the messes 
caused by these voting machine 
errors — and these arc just the 
ones that ivere discovered — 
might get a yawn when readers 
only see one dooimenlcd in a 
hometown paper. Compiled 
together, these election errors 

our votmg system. 

The companies thai make 
the voting machines die accura- 
cy of 99 percent or bet ler in their 
sales presentations, but have 
admitted to errors of 20 percent 
or more when caught. 

Most errors arc discovered 
by local elechons officials or 
candidates who are alarmed by 
discrepancies. Sometimes, a 
tone patriotic voter will spot the 
error and make noise unlil 
^ something. More 
docs anything, 
knows how many 
go undetected, or 

one did anything 
Tiplainl. In many 
' ol election results 
can only be accomplished If peo- 
ple who already hold a political 
office agree to it. The companies 
who make voting machines 
often admit lo creating the 
errors. Tlie ballot-making and 
vote-counting errors cin und 
do) swing electiorvi. 






how many 
because no 



Most of Ihe time, local offi- 
cials are unable to arrange for 
independent investigations — 
they must call Ihe company that 
sold Ihc machines. Only the 
company's own expert Is 
allowed to work with their prc»- 
prielary software. 

The most basic process in 
democracy — voting — begins 
with the mechanism used by the 
public: the ballots, the machines 
that register the voles and the 
computer code that counts the 
voles. Currently, all three steps 
are controlled by just a handhil 
ol private individuals who own 
Ihe handful of companies that 
make ballols, machines and 
computer counting codes. 

Would voting machine 
companies deliberately do any- 
thing wrong? They have access, 
many have conflicts ol interest 
and some admit to "program- 
ming errors" (ivhen caught). 
They do not allow independent 
investigators access to their 
counting codes. It only takes one 
person lo implement program- 
ming mischief. 

At least one company was 
financed by a right-wing polih- 
cal activist credited with putting 

the legislature; one company 
has an oivner who is currenlly 
campaign beasurer for Republican 
Senator Chuck Hagel The 
republican senator himself was, 
at one time, the head ol the vol- 
mg machine company that 
counted his own election. 

Local citizens and Ihe 
county election boards carmot 
look for the cause of Ihe prob- 
lem — they must call in repre- 
sentatives of the voting machine 
companies to tell them why all 
the Sparush ballots had the traru- 
lation garbled, or why Ihe 
machine counted 20 percent of 
the votes incorrectly.

Talion.com, a publicity firm. She 
has Iwcn a professional writer 
for 12 years, and began writing 
about elechon security issues, 
specifically regarding voting 
machines when she discovered 
5ome of the fraud that sur^

day when children cat so much

numbing their psyche, soothing 
their souls. It is a modem day 
Bacchic revelry, 

A Catholic church is trans-

bring to hgnl those dark secrets

sit in a huddle hoping that the 
"me" of the present is strong 
enough to overcome the pain 
and fear of the "me" of the past. 

We all live in our own little 
comfort zone. We are told by the 
media what to believe, what is 
real. If the truth is too far out o( 
the box, too (ar away from our

suppressed, leaving victims 
alone and wondering why such 
horrors can be committed in

in the darkness of silence.

that wc do have a voice. We do

It is much more difficult for me

Mars Asks, Venus Answers: Boy band fascination 



By Gretchen Hahn and Alan 
Waprer 

Staff Colummsli 

Mars Asks: 

All right ladies, I just don't 
get it. What is the fascirution 
with these boy bands? I didn't 
understand it five years ago 
when the New Kids On The 
Block were the big thing (they 
were still cool in '97, right?), and 
I don't understand it now. 

1 especially don't under- 
stand the craze about that 
blonde one with the perm. 
What's up with that? I think that 
he wants to be an even whiter 
Michael lackson. 

Seriously, though, what is it 
about being in a boy band that 
automatically makes you cool? I 
mean, take a look at these guys 
individually and not as a group. 
Dorks. I think that at the Boy 
Band Factory in Orlando, they 
try to see how odd of a group of 
guys they can put together and 
still have the girls swoon. It 
makes it a challenge. Boy bands 
are the duck-billed platypus of 
the music industry. 

I'll warn you now that in five 
years, all of^you boy band faru 
are gorma be laughing at your- 
selves for having listened to 
these guys. Trust me, "Step by 
step it s gonna get to you gi-r-r- 
Uls." And the worst part is that 
these "bands" can't hold a can- 
dle to Joe, Jordan, Jonathan. 



Danny and Dormy! So. please, if 
there is any explanation for this 
phenomenon, let me know! 

Until then, this will be right 
up there with the Bermuda 
Triangle and Bigfoot for unex- 
plained mysteries' 

Venus Responds: 

It's like this; Girls like 
romance, and these guys know 
thati These "boy bands" you 
mention {notice tlial a majority 
of these guys are in their twen- 
ties) tuvc the look, voice and 
money that women desire. The 
music they sine (granted they 
don't play) makes us feel like 
they are singing to us personally! 

Patl\etic. I'll admit, but 
you "real" guys who actually 
play the instruments and sing 
these love ballads to us arc few 
and far between. The permed- 
hair chap you mentioned (Justin 
Timberlake), while maybe seem- 
ingly similar to Michael Jackson, 
does in (act have talent, in my 
opinion. Why does it matter if 
these fellas are in a five-man 
group ot are solo artists? V^buld 
it make a difference? 

On the flip side, I have to 
agree that it does seem a bit 
(ad-ish to partake in this pop- 
obsession. The guys will soon 
experience voice changes (ha- 
ha) and no longer appeal to the 
audiences that they do now. 
But, until then, sing on boys — 
we'll be listening! 




Rightist Halloween: God and Pagans 



Greetings from the right! 
This is supposed to be about 
Halloween, so I will try to keep 
the formalities short. 

First, I have been thinking 
about something after absorbing 
the comments of another student 
whose name I don't know. He 
expressed briefly that the right 
and the le(t really aren't that lar 
apart, which I have determined 
to be amazingly true. We thii\k 
tful just because we belong to 
one parly or another, Ihatwe ore 
automatically cither a conserva- 
tive Republican or a Hberal 
Democrat. ' 

The humbling fact of the 
matter is that maybe I'm just 
realizing this, and everyone else 
already knew it. This realization 
became even more apparent a 
few days ago when my girl- 
friend. Becky, told me that she 
votes democratic and is a liberal. 
As you all know by now. I am of 
course the opposite. 

Tliis was actually a bit 
shocking, knowing full well that 



trying to make here is that it has 
been most difficult for me to 
write this column completely 
from the right, for 1 am not a 
Southern Baptist, a Pentecostal 
or a Mormon, nor do I belong to 
any church organization. 

I do, however, hove faith in 
God from heaven above, and I 
believe the Bible is his word. 
What you do and 
whatever resides 
m your heart is 
between you and 
Him, not between 



s, which the guys just 
adore (author included). The 
guys either do nothing or go all 
out and either attempt to be 
humorously offensive or down- 
right gross and ugly. 

I ve noticed that the 
amount of the prize money has a 
profound effect on the clever- 
ness of the coshime. Ifs all in

JAuthor's note: Recently, a dis- 
play table for the Pagan Student 
AJliance group was set up in 
Walb. I found out that they arc 
normal kids, not a bunch of 
Satan worshippers. Merriam 
Webster states thai the exact def- 
inition of pagan is simply "coun- 
try dweller.'! 

Many of you may recall the 
movie "Dragnet" that came out 
about 10 years ago tliat showed 
pagans as "people against good 
and normalcy." They sacrificed a 
virgin and were downright evil 
and disgusting. 

Here is a fine example of 
industry distorting 



Halloween in a negative way, 
but I had to go back and delete it. 
According lo the student group's 
information flyer, pagans are 
basically folks who worship 
nature and acknowledge the har- 
monic cycle of life/seasons, and 
are not of Jewish, Christian or 
Muslim faith.

Piercing: Weighing tine risks 



ilcdlothei 
upper pari of the ear, eyebrow. 
riKc. fneek, lip, longue, navel 
and genilals are several other 
aro3s where piercing is being 
performed loday. 

This ancjeni form ol art has 
been on the rise in the adolescent 
and young adult popufalion. but 
few studies have been done on 
this phenomenon. The "Mayo 
Clinic Proceedings" recently 
published a shidy researching 
the incidence of medical compli- 
caltans associated with body 
piercing and lallooing. A ques- 
tionnaire completed by 454 
undergraduates from a New 
Yorkcollege showed that one out 
of six who had piercing done 
eupcrienced some type o( med- 
' complication. 

With different forms of pierc- 
, compliialioru such as bleed- 
. tissue trauma, scarring, bade- 
infectians, tetanus, viral infec- 
is and oral injuries ore possi- 
ble. The most common complica- 
bleeding, tissue dam- 
age and bacterial infections, with 
the nose being more likely to 
lileed and navcland genital pierc- 



ing bong at gioilcr risk for infection. 
The study also commuru' 
caled the potential risk for trans- 
missions of hepatitis B. hepatitis 
C or human irrununodeficiency 
virus (HIV). Hepatitis is an infec- 
tion of the liver that is transmit- 
ted through blood and can cause 
liver damage or death. Those 
receiving piercing and even the 

K' rrcers are at risk for blood- 
ume infections if proper pre- 

Allcrgies can also affect 
body piercing. Those with metal 
sensitivity have difficulty wear- 
ing the studs or barbells placed 
in the pierced site. In a study 
published in a professional jour- 
nal, two physicians evaluated a 
method to reduce melal sensitiv- 
ity during ear piercing. 

They found that this com- 
plication could be greatly 
reduced by using an intravenous 
catheter needle to pierce the earr 
lobe. The catheter is then left in 
place and trimmed to size. There 
were no complications in any of 
the 31 subjects in the study 
group. Many of the the partici- 
pants in the sludy had stopped 
wearing earrings due to allergic 
reactions to the metal, but after- 
wards, all participants were able 
to tolerate the earrings. The 



physicians did note that this 
method works best with gold or 
stainless steel earnngs. 

Etody piercing is not as sim- 
ple as it sounds. The benefits 
need to be weighed against the 
rislts. Several IPFVV students 
with pierdn^ identified enhanced 
appearance as a major benefit. 

Recipients of body piercings 
need to inform themselves of the 
procedure and the nsks associat- 
ed with it. If a student is thinking 
about body piercing, there are a 
few questions that the student 
should ask before the procedure. 

A writer for "Current Health" 
magazine identified the follow- 
ing questions to ast before body 
piercing: 

• Is the perycm doing the pjcrdng 
certified or licensed bv the 
Association of I^fcasional Piercers? 

• Is the enviroiuneht for the 
piercing clean? 

• Is the procedure itself slen!e7 

• Are the studs or barbells made 
of stainless steel? 

• How does the piercer make 
sure the piercing sites are even, 
and how docs the piercer line up 
the entrance and exit locations? 

Looking into the procedure 
beforehand can limit complica- 
tions and improve satisfaction 
with the outcome.

Jazz great at Purdue 



WtST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (PU News) — Renowned j: 
Wayne Shorter ivill perform with th 
1. Friday, Nov. 8, inLoeb Playhoi 






and saxophi 
Shorter Quariet at 

Admission is S24 for the general public and S17 for Purdue siu- 
dcnts and children K-12. Tickets can be purchased at Purdue box 
offices or charged by phone at (765) 494-3933 or (800) 9H-SHOVV. 
Tickets are also available at all Ticketmastcr outlets. The Wa&gt;'ne 
Shorter Quariet is presented by Purdue Convocations, 

Shorler's tenure with Art Blakey'sja/H Messengers in the early 
1960s established him as a new star and a formidable composer. He 
w,is second only to Duke Ellington as best composer in a 1962 
Doivnbcat poll. 

In 1964, he was invited to tour with Miles Davis and stayed 
with the famous Irumpcler for six years, recording more than a 
dozen albums with him between 1965 and 1968. The quintet was 
composed of Davis on trumpet. Shorter on tenor saxophone, Herbie 
Hancock on piano, Ron Carter on bass and Tony Williams on drums. 

Durine his time with Davis, Shorter composed well over half 
the tunes they recorded, including such standards as "Footprints," 
"The Sorcerer," "Water Babies," "Nefertiti," "infant Eyes" and 
"I'inocchio," 

After leaving Davis and co-founding Weather Report with key- 
boardist Joe ZawinuL Shorter demorutrated his versatility and 
musical curiosity by lecording an award-wirming album called 
"Native Dancer with an array of Brazilian and American musi- 
cians. He also appeared on pop recordings by Joni Mitchell and 
Steely Dan. Wealner Report, founded in 1970, became the most pop- 
ular and commercially successful fusion group of the '70s and early '80s. 

Shorter announced more than a year ago that he was forming 
an acoustic quartet to tour extensivelv for a couple of years. The 

?uartet was rounded out by Brian Blade, Darulo Perez and John 
atitucci. 

Bass player Palitucci has been in demand as a Jazz sideman for 
the past 20 years. He most recently toured and recorded with Herbie 
Hancock in celebration of the conlnbulions made by Davis and John 
Coltrane. 

Drummer Brian Blade also was part of that group. Shorter says 
he finds Blade's ivork "fresh, exciting and infused with the New 
Orleans music and experience he grew up with." 

Panamanian pianist Perez, Shorter says, "brings immense 
energy, rhythmic complexity and iruiovation, youthful enthusiasm 
and a uruque Panamanian perspective." 

Pahtucci, who has worked on and off with Shorter for more 
than a decade, says: "He always thinks compositionally We play the 
tune in straight rhythm that is African-oriented, sometimes in 
swinging time, and abo very 'slowly, with almost a Brazilian feel. 
With all those options to choose from. Wayne keeps his rhythms 
swirling and pliaole, and anything but predictable." 

Shorter says, "1 like music to celebrate all the stuff we go 
through in life. Not just being in love or losing at love, or that win- 
ning kind of music like 'Rocky,' 1 like music with struggle in it."

Good Charlotte plows through Indianapolis 




P(iu/o by At'^ndu I'jncf, Ciicsl Flmlagraplier 
Guitarist/vocalist Bcnji Madden belts out one of Good Charlotte's 
hits during a concert on their "Young and the Hopeless" lour. 

By Dan Vance deal during their set. Guitarist 

Sporii Writer David Dcsrosicrs and lead vocal- 

ist Pierre Bouvier did slop to talk 
a few times about their 
Canadian roots and their French 
speaking abilitv. 

But, Simple Plan made their 
impact by rocking. One of my 
favorite songs of the night w. 



the crowd involved, bassist Rob 
Kucharek made the mood even 
better with what he referred to 
as his "ni^lly speech." 

Kucharek made sure that 
everyone in the crowd under- 
stood A PCs message that they 
dislike everyone who tries to 
label punk rock. He even went as 
far as to use an expletive to 
describe those who try to label 
punk and called them not punk 
rock. Kucharek said punk was 
two things: friends and music, 
and that's it, 

APO kept hitting hard after 
(he speech and had a set to be 
reckoned with. 1 was happy to 
hear-:tilothina Eniguoncy intro- 
duced, considering thai I actual- 
ly knew it All in all, APO 
proved why they will be head- 
lining J lour of the ir own as soon 
as they drop a lull-length album. 
And, after hearing their live set, I 
urge everyone to pick up their 
self-tilled EP or their first album, 
the 1999 release "Looking Up," 

After APO, il was the time 1 
ivas waiting for. It was time for 
Good Charlotte. Good Charlotte 
I'.vccuted most of the songs on 
their new CD with great enthusi- 
asm, despite the ctmdibons inside 
The Kni^ts of Columbus hall. 

Perhaps the most interne 
performance I have ever wit- 
nessed was highlighted by 
"Anthem" and "The Young and

album. The crowd participation 
- - ■-'i for Good 



Are you young? Do you 
consider yourself 'hopeless?" 
Or are you just in the mood for 
some good punk rock? Well, it's 
too late because chances arc that 
you missed the definitive con- 
cert of the year, whether you fit 
those descriptions or not. 

On Wednesday, I3ct. 23, 
yours truly enjoyed a two hour 
ride to Indianapolis to catch the 
latest stop on The Young and 
the Hopeless" Tour 2002. A mere 
515 and a third of my day for all 
the rock crammed into this 
show. Who could ask for more? 

The parking lot luie for this 
general admission show was 
about as unique as you could ask 
for. At one point, a pick-up truck 
nearly ran over hall of the Imcof 
fans. Thai was only after the 
people ahead of me m line rev- 
eleo in the excitement of nearly 
lighting each other on fire. 

After spending around an 
hour in the cold, the doors 
opened. After checking out the 
merchandise, I joined my sister 
up front for the show. Around 
eight o'clock, the sea of 800-900 
people was ready for the show to 

The Canadian punk group 
Simple Plan hit the stage first. 
Unlike my r' "■ " "' ' 



The crowd interaction, however, 
was good for the band. A major- 
ity of the audience seemed very 
interested in the performa — 



mted, i 



with. 



By far, the best song Simple 
Plan played was the first single 
from their album. The second 
that 'I'm Just a Kid" hit, the 
crowd went crazy. The crowd 
participation for this song was 
by far the best for the group, 
hinting that most of the crowd 
might not have their album. But, 
afle^ "I'm Just a Kid," Simple 
Plan was off for the evening to 
sign autographs at their mer- 
chandise table. 

Up next was the Good 
Charlotte-endorsed group. 
Autopilot Off (APO). The group 
received a good deal of recogni- 
tion this summer at the Vans 
Warped Tour, especially by lend- 
ing drummer Phil Rotinson to 
Good Qiarlot te for parts of the tou r. 

APO showed tremendous 
ability during their set. I had 
heard alt of one APO song before 
the show, and il was nowhere 
near as eood as their bve set. 
Though the crowd participation 
was down from Simple Plan, 
APO proved why they deserved 
1o be on this tour. 

Suiprisingly, between songs 
'• — "■"•'! singer Chris Johnson 



the Benji and Joel show. It was 
bassist Paul Thomas who kept 
me excited through the set with 
his rapid and hyper spinning 
coupled with his head banging. 
Thomas' stage presence is uncan- 
ny and seemingly uiunalchablc by 
any bond member that 1 can 
think of. 

All members of the group 
were very giving of their water. 
They continuously threw water 
into the hot and sweaty audi- 
ence. 1 can honestly say mat it is 
enjoyable to get some cool water 
when you're sweating profusely 
in a barely ventilated building. 
Thpugh, when 1 went to calch a 
.bottle, thrown by guitarist GlUy 
Martin, I cau_gl)|l a goAd ham- 
mering to my right hand that 
slill throbs as I write this five 
days later. 

Good Charlotte gave the 
hall the distinction of nVeirdest 
Venue" due to its middle school 
gym-esque look and church play 
stage. The band wrapped up the 
lu'^t wnlh their single "Lifestyles 
of the Rich and the Famous." It 
was sad to see such a great show 
end. even though I was drenched

some that belonged to other peo- 
ple) and not properly hydra ted. 
This was a show not to be 
missed. Obviously, Good Charlolte 
was the star of the show, but 
Simple Plan and APO laid down 
sets that were masterful as well. 
If Good Charlotte's album was 
eclectic, this show was purely 
comprehensive and excellently 
diverse. But, then again, thats 
just my opinion. No need to run 
me over with a combine.

"I thought we played out-

Hartley said. "We out-dug them 
93-84, and blocks were even, 
which IS unusual (or us. I Ihirvk 
our blockers adjusted pretty 
well We only hit 18 percent, but 
we held them to seven percent. II 
was iusi a good team effort." 

T^e Dons (11-14) were led 
defensively by Sarah Lclfcrs 
\vilh 2S digs, and Mo Meinharl 
had 17 digs along wilh 12 kills. 
Janclle Pollard paced IPFW's

"Janellc Pollard had anoth- 
er nice night." said Hartley. 
"Fabiana had an off nighl, but 
it's nice lo know that we have 
other people who can step up. I 
think our defense was ivhal won 
this match, though," 

Toledo opened the fiisl 
game by laking an 8-3 lead 
Before IPFW's first limeoul. 
Followmg the break, the Dons 
gained service alter a kill by

IPFW fails to take down big sister 

Mastodons follow up Friday's win with 'uninspired' loss 



Hosting IPFW's sisler school — 
and obvious rival — lUPUl less than 
24 hours alter a momentous win over 
Toledo, women's volleyball coach 
Kclley Hartley was expecting intense 
focus from her leam Saturday al Ihe 
Gales Center. 

What Hartley got was an unin- 
spired performance and uUimalely a 
loss lo Ihe Jaguars 23-30. 30-23, 22-30 
and 28-30. 

"Lasl nighl was such a great 
team effort. 1 just Ihink our effort 
/said. 

we lust came oul real flat 'and never 
really got any momentum going. Our 
hitting percentage was about 13 per- 
cent, and you're just nol going lo beat 
anybody hitting 13 percent as a learn. 
11 was Just not a good day for us," 

lUPUI being IPFW's sister insti- 
tution was not the only reason the 
Mastodons were hopmg (or a victory. 
"It was more of a rivalry because 
they beat us lasl year, and we didn't

thmk Ihey should have," said Dons 
middle hitler Kirsla Soltwrg. "We did- 
n't play a very good match last year, 
so we were looKing forward lo this 
malch lo come back and beat them." 

Hartley believes the Jaguars beat 
Ihe Mastodons al their own game, 

"lUPUl is a good team, Tlicy 
work really hard, and Ihey kind of did 
to us what we did lo Toledo lasl 
ni^l," she said. "I think they out- 
worked us a little bil. I think we were 
frustrated by the fact that Ihev dug a 
lol of balls and played our style." 

IPFW (11-15) was led by Solberg 
ivith 14 kills, II digs and a .400 hitting 
percentage. 

"Kirsta Solberg played really 
well, and I Ihink her errors stuck out 
only because Ihey came al bad limes," 
Hartley said. 

Also for the Dons. Fabiana Sou/a 
had IS kills and (our blocks, and 
Janelle Pollard added 10 kills and four 
aces. Mo Meinhart had 24 digs and 
nine kills, while Sarah Leffers chipped 
in 18 digs. Lindi Bankowski finished 
with 52 assists and 11 digs. 

The Jaguars look command in 
the opening game, never giving up 
the lead while cruising lo a 30-23 win. 

The Mastodons turned the tables 
in game h,vo, trailing just once when 
an error by Meinharl gave lUPUl a 
brief 4-3 lead. The Dons regained the 
lead behind the service of Nicole Ray 
and never trailed Ihe remainder of Ihe 



game. IPFW lied Ihe match at a game 
apiece with a 30-23 victory. 

The lead was swapped five times 
in Ihe third game. Kills ey Souza and 
Meinharl gave the Dons a 3-1 advan- 
tage lo start the malch. but three 
straight IPFW errors gave the lead lo 
the Jaguars at 5-3. 

TWo consecutive aces by Pollard 
regained the lead for the Mastodons at 
8-7, before lUPUl went ahead behind 
Ihc service o( Kalie Hahn. An ace and 
a kill by Soltscrg and a kilt by Amy 
Grove pul IPFW on top again al 14-11. 
The Jaguars then took the lead for 
good wilh Morgan Spaulding serving 
and (venl on lo a 30-i2 win. 

"We've had a lol of ups and 
downs, and in this match we really 
showed that. I Ihink wc Just make 
mistakes al Ihe wrong limes, and we 
don't come together when we need 
to," Solberg said, "l( ivc had come out 
playine like we did last night, vie 
would ve handled them with no prob^ 
lem, I guess we jusl weren't as focused 
tonight." 

The Mastodons led (rom tlie start 
in game four but could never gain 
more than a five-point advantage, 
lUPUl slowly chipped at the Dons' 
lead and eventually gained eonlrol at 
23-22 on their way lo a 30-28 victory lo 
win the malch. 

IPFW will host Chicago Stale

This and that: the 
week in review 



The baseball season came lo a close adei

in Ibis week's In All Dinxlions. 



had ail Ihe makings of a classic. You would think 
Ihal more people would have been ivalching. 

The 2002 edilion of Major League Baseball's 
championship series was one of the lowest raled 
WoclJ Series ever on Iclevision, Sure, il lacked Ihe 
slai power of another Yankees /Braves World 
Series, bul il was intriguing. 

I watched many of the games hoping lo be 
able lo revel in a Giants' loss and Bonds falling jusi 
short. My day was made on Sunday not by seeing 
the Angets celebrating, bul by seeing Bonds sit 
back molionless in a dark comet ol the Giants 
dugout- 



Rain, rain, go away. The NASCAR Winston 
Cup season continued its wet ways Ihis week in 
Atlanta. 

In a crucial lime of Ihe year. Jimmie Johnson 
reminded us all Uiat he was just a rookie. Going 
inlolherace,John.son was second in Ihe slandings- 
Afler a 22nd-place finish, johruon was back lo 
third place, over ISO points out of first place. It's 
sad lo sec such a good season down Ihc lubes. 

Thanks lo Ihe rain-shortened race, Kurt 
Busih ivalked away with his second straight win. 
Make no mistake, despite Johnson's issues on 
Sunday, the rookies are dominant this year. With 
Johnson in IhinJ and Ryan Newman tourth, the 
naokic class is ready to win. 

In addition. ever&gt;' joumalisl's favorite driver, 
Tony Stewart, retained Ihe points lead, ll's amaz- 
mg how cordial and smiley Stewart can bi" wilh 



The Los Angeles Lakers must have confused 
ihe meaning of the term "p re-season." Irulead of 
Iheit basketball abilities, the Lakers showcased 
Ihcir Immaturity last week against Sacramenlo 

Several times m Ihe game. Rick Fo« and KoK- 
Bryant began small scuffies with Kings plavfr^ 
The last scuffle between Fox and Doug Chnslic 
sow both ejected from the game. After tliai. the 
childish Fo* crossed over lo Ihe turuiel leading lo 
Ihe Kings' locker room aivJ put Quislic in a headlock 

So much for Staples Center security. The scuf 
fie occurred in view of manyfans and players and 
the benches soon cleared. The injured Shaquille 
O'Neal even got into the act by provoking a snov- 
ing match wilh Vlade Divac. 

If the NBA fails lo act on Ihis infantile fit by 
Ihe Lakers. I may asphyxialc on my own vomil. 
The Lakers don't rule the world, and Rick Fox. 
along with the organization, should be punished. 



Cod bless the BC5, the poll that keeps on 
cheating. What a strugele for number one? 
Oklahoma or Miami (Ra.)TWho will win this clash 
of Ihe titans? That's easy: Notre Dame. 

l-low many "upsel" wins must the Fighting 
Irish have before people lake- them as a serious 
threat? A win over Florida Slate should solidifv 
Notre Dame's status. Lee Corso, Chad Ford and all 
the experls must be in a deep haze lo continue lo 
count out Notre Dame. 

So maybe Miami and Oklahoma have more 
talent, but they don't have what Notre Dame has: 
the best coach in all of college foolball. Ty 
Wiliingham was the best decision in the school s 
history, but when will everyone else recognize it? 

Oh yeah, NHL season has begun. I consider 
myself a huge fan of all sports, bul I didn't even 
realize the season started unlil six games into the 

II seems lo me that as other sports gel bigger, 
hockey is beingpushed aside. But il happens, wel- 
come lo life in the ESPN era. 



The game of the week was withoul a doubt 
game six of the World Series. Trailing 5-0 in the 
siilh inning, the Angels tallied back to win 6-5 and 
force a game seven. The big bat of the World 
Series, MVP Ttoy Glaus, combmed with San 
Francisco's ugly ball handling, were what did the 

The player of the week is Emmill Smith. Love 
him or hate him. Smith is Ihe new all-lime leading 
rusher in the NFL Though, he never will be Walter 
Paylon. 



Missed opportunities doom IPFW 



FORT WAYNE — The IPFW Hockey Club

First-half goals give

MACOMB, 111. — Three firsl-hall goals by the

Williamson (656), Shacina Herscy (21:23) and 
Kristin Macdonald (32:42) to give the Mastodons a

bounced off the post, while Casey Cox blasted a 
pair of shots that were slopped by IPFW's Rachel Poor- 
Western got an the board in the 87th minute 
when midfielder Pam Ficarra dribbled through
