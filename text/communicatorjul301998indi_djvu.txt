Yes, you can afford a PC for college 



1 Santa Clara, CaJif., PRNewswire— If 
you're looking to make sure you get the 
most out of your college years, you'll warn 
a solid com- 
puter to get 



"If you buy a fast 
machine with as 
much memory and 
disk space as you 
can afford... 
you'll get the 
most out of your 
investment." 

Kevin Teixeira, 
Intel Corporation 



you through, 
according 10 
Kevin 

Teixeira, 
manager of 
College 
Programs for 
Intel 
Corporation. 
N o 
matter which 
state-of-the- 
art computer 
you buy right 
now, it will 
seem slow in 



about two years and be obsolete in about 
four. 

"If you buy a Tasl machine with as 
much memory and disk space as your can 
afford, and make sure you can expand it as 
necessary, you'll get the most out of your 
investment," Teixeira says. 

Parents and siudents can get more infor- 
mation on college, careers and computers at 
The Princeton Review online at 
www.review.com/ 

This website offers a variety of infor- 
mation, including a new Guide lo Campus 
Computing. 

Here are Teixeira's tips for buying a 
computer for the college -bound student: 

1. Think software first— What 
will the machine be used for? The software 
you will be using determines necessary fea- 
tures and horsepower. 

Even if students think ihey only need it 



for word processing tinlay. their needs will 
grow faster than you can say "graduation." 
A less-capable system may not be able 
lo handle tomorrow's homework. 

2. Set a Clear budget— New com- 
puters range from under SI000 Tor a "Basic 
PC" to $3500 for fully-equipped 
"Performance PCs." 

The Golden Rule: Buy as big a system 
as you can afford. 

3. Get a BIG brain (no, not for 
you....) — Look for the most powerful 
microprocessor, or "brain" chip, you can 
afford. 

You can get by on a 300-MHz Intel (R) 
Celeron (R) processor, but a PC based on a 
400- or 450-MHz Penuum (R) II processor 
will be able to handle even the most taxing 
software program and challenging assign- 
ments — and therefore will be able to keep 
up with your needs for a longer lime. 



4. Get lots of memory— The tech- 
no buzz word here is RAM (for Random 
Access Memory). 

More memory will allow you to do 
more things at once, and speed most pro- 
grams dramatically. 

Gel at least 32 megabytes of memory. 

5. Get plenty of storage— The 
(rend in software is for bigger and bigger 
programs, so get a big hard disk (or "filing 
cabinet"). 

Look for at least a 4-GB (gigabyte, or a 
billion bytes) disk. 

The cost increase of going from four to 
six gigabytes is usually less than S100 and 
may be worth it. 

You may want to consider a removable 
drive that holds more information, like a 
"ZIP" drive. 

Also make sure the CD-ROM drive is at 



least 8X-speed. 

6, Warranties and PC 
support — Is there a nearby service center 
authorized to repair' or provide technical 
support? 

If not, consider buying a support service 
that can answer questions such as "Where is 
my toolbar?" or "How do I install my 
modem?" 

A good support service will also include 
virus protection and file backup and 
restoration. 

The last thing you want is for a vims to 
destroy your thesis. 

Bottom line: Do your homework to 
ensure you're getting exactly what you need 
for today — and tomorrow.

Be a savvy renter! 



Chicago, PRNewswire — Tenant-advocate and 
professional mediator, Ed Sacks, puts his decades 
of experience at the service of the millions of 
renters nationwide. 

First-timers, in particular, can get tripped up in 
the jargon of security deposits, evictions and rental 
insurance. 

"1 want to help people find aitractive, comfort- 
able, affordable places to live," says Sacks in "The 
Savvy Renter's Kit" (S22.95, Real Estate 
Education Company). 

Thirty-four percent of U.S. housing stock, or 
35 million units, are rentals. 

However, paying your rent is more of a chunk 
of your paycheck. 

In fact, according to Sacks, "More than sixty- 



six percent of renters in the nation's forty-four 
largest dues pay more than fifty percent of their 
income on housing." 

Nationwide, it's fifty percent of tenants paying 
greater than fifty percent of their income on 
housing. 

"While the recommended limit of thirty per- 
cent of income be devoted to rent, a whopping 
eighty-four percent of renters are paying more than 
this recommended percentage," said Sacks. 

Sacks, based in Chicago, is a regular writer and 
speaker on rental and tenant topics to consumers 
and professionals. 

He was named mediator of the year by the 
Illinois Better Business Bureau. 



Here are some smart strategies to keep in mindi 
whether you're a first time renter or an old pro: {. 

1. First determine your housing needs,; 
including location, amount of space and costs. J 

2. When you find a place, do a detailed) 
inspection and make notes. 

3. Don't sign anything or hand over money 
until you read, understand and feel comfortable 
with the deal. 

4. Keep your move organized using a mas- 
ter plan. 

5. Spell out financial relationships and 
"house rules" for successfully living with a 
roommate. 



Bourbon Festival offers fun and spirits 



Bards town, Ken., PRNews wire- 
Premium brands, the return of ele- 
gant drinks and the desire for quali- 
ty are leading a global resurgence of 
Bourbon whiskey that the entire 
industry will celebrate this Sept. 17- 
20 ai the seventh annual Kentucky 
Bourbon Festival. 

The Bourbon Festival is a mecca 
for Bourbon aficionados that gives 
the visitors a rare glimpse of the 
place and the people supplying the 
world with ninety-eight percent of 
its Bourbon. 



The festival captures all aspects 
of the industry and the versatility of 
the product with workshops, compe- 
titions, Q &amp; A sessions and of 
course, cocktail hours and tastings. 

Visitors can learn to cook with 
Bourbon, partake in an evening of 
Bourbon, jazz and cigars, watch 
warehouse workers compeie in the 
World Championship Bourbon 
Barrel Relay Races, dine elegantly 
on foods cooked with Bourbon 
aboard My Old Kentucky Dinner 
Train and bid on premium botdes of 



Bourbon signed by iheir favorite 
master distillers. 

The festival's highlight is a 
black-tie gala, featuring the best and 
brightest celebrities of the industry 
showcasing their wares. 

A Bourbon lasting tent hosts a 
glitzy cocktail hour, with unique 
separate booths for each of 
Kentucky's distillers. 

Last year, guests came from as 
far away as lapan, England, Spain. 
Australia and the Czech Republic 
for the festivities. More than 30,000 



participated in the events, and 900 
attended the gala. 

Bourbon is Kentucky's top 
export product, evolving in the stale 
due to its natural resources of com, 
limestone-filtered iron-free waier 
and variations in temperatures dur- 
ing the winier and summer months. 

The Bards town area boasts four 
of the stale's nine distilleries, and 
had been dubbed "The Bourbon 
Capital of the World"

val and lodging, call 800-638^1877.

What's the use in going to col- 
lege? 

Is it really going to get us a bet- 
ter-paying job or arc we just going 
to spend the rest of our lives trying 
to pay off the loans for thousands 
of dollars wc paid to team the dif- 
ference between anthropology and 
archaeology? 

There are people oui there who 
didn't go to college and arc mak- 
ing thousands of dollars more than 
wc are each year, and we are strug- 
gle to get by. 

Why does life have to be like 
this? 

Why are we dishing out all of 
this money to team about English 
and psychology when all wc want 
is a decent job that pays well and 
keeps us living comfortably? 

At least once in a semester (he 
idea of quilting or giving up goes 
through the mind of every college 
student. 

So what keeps them going? 

The answer is simple if you are 
a trained psychologist. 

If you are not, the best way to 
describe the answer is this: 

Going to college and attempt- 
ing to graduate adds another thing 
to keep you a step ahead of the peo- 
ple who didn't go to college. 

It gives another thing for you to 
accomplish that not everyone is 
able to. 

If you decide to go lo work 
right after high school and start 
making money then you might be 
making more in four years than 
what the college graduate might be 
making, but attending college is 
supposed to be better for you in the 
long run. 

No one should come to college 
and expect to be making a six-digit 
figure the year they graduate. 

Some people can do il, but you 
might be better off betting to win 
the lottery.

So why bother with taking all

life? This is another simple answer:

to have a litde culture. 

College is meant to teach peo- 
ple to think about their surround- 
ings, question things and to come 
to some sensible solution to a prob- 
lem. 

If you don't really want to 
learn how to these things, then 
maybe you don't belong in college. 

IPFW has been doing a great 
job in getting people started in the 
direction of Ihe goals of college, 
but as the commercial goes on the 
radio, "It's a great place to get start- 
ed." . 

We have a problem with this 
adverse advertising. 

We feel that IPFW is a perfect- 
ly good place so get a full college 
education. 



The staff works with the stu- 
dents to help them undersland what 
is being taught. 

Why is IPFW being advertised 
in this manner? 

Do they mink that once stu- 
dents come to get iheir start here 
that they are going to find that it is 
some hidden El Dorado? 

It seems thai some students 
Find larger campuses more desir- 
able and find this is because they 
jusi offer more mat ihey are inter- 
ested in. 

They see a lack of dungs lhat 
are essential to programs here at 
IPFW and venture off to a larger 
campus in search of them, 

Why doesn't IPFW stand Firm 
on being a perfcedy fine institution 



that has die besl of both worlds? 

Why don't they advertise thai 
IPFW is a place lo gel a good edu- 
cation thai is just as good as any 
other place? 

Could someone answer this 
question for us? 

What's the use in going to col- 
lege, especially when the college 
itself advertises that there may be a 
lack in ihe programs as a whole? 

Once again we would like an 
answer to ibis. 

Until IPFW figures out a way 
lo positively portray this universi- 
ty, what's the use in trying to get an 
education here? 



Everyday Epiphanies.

Editor 



"Music revives the recollections il would 

appease. " 

— Germaine de Stael 

"Music was invented lo confirm human 

loneliness. " 

— Lawrence Durrell 

"We do not remember days, we remember 

moments. " 

— Ccsare Pavese 

"Cod created memory so that we might 

have roses in December. " 

— Italo Svevo 

Music is an integral part of my life. Il 
seems to echo in everything that I do. 
Because it is so important to me, it often 
serves as a toll dial bookmarks certain chap- 
ters in my life for future reference. 

It's almost as though certain songs are 
like my own personal "soundtrack." 

Whenever I hear these "theme songs," I 
am instandy transported lo a certain time or 
place in my life. 

I get this strange feeling that I'm experi- 
encing an evenl for Ihe second, third or even 
tenth time. 

It's strange, but music has the power to 
evoke ihe strongest of emotions. It's almost 
as though songs express things thai I cannot 
seem to do. Thai would make music an emo- 
tional release for me, I suppose. 

Whaiever the case, il happens over and 
over and over, and my soundtrack is ever- 
growing. 

I'm sure thai I'm not the only one who 
lives life like this. I can firmly bet lhat every- 
one has, at one lime or another, cried when a 
certain song was playing. 

Hey, I'll be the first to admit thai I have. 
I'm sure I'll do il again, loo. 

Every single lime I hear the Aerosmith 
song, "Angel." my heart skips a beat, and I'm 
suddenly in junior high school again. 

Someone (a boy who shall remain name- 



less) hurt me, and he hurt me big lime. This 
whole painful episode look place at a slupid 
school dance, and "Angel" was ihe next song 
thai was played by ihe DJ. 

Thai song will forever remain synony- 
mous with dial boy. I can always recall his 
(ace and what he wore that nighi and all sorts 
of other details when I hear lhat song. 

There are other songs lhat have similar 
effects on me. "The Greatest Man I Never 
Knew" reminds me of my father. It is so true- 
to-life lhat I cry almost every single time that 
I hear it 

1 bought ihe 
CD just so thai I 
could have lhat 




contact with his family and lives what musi 
be an awfully lonely life. 

There are some lines in that song that 
depict everything that I remember of him: 
"Jessie paints her pictures about how it's 
gonna be; By now I should know better. Your 
dreams are never free; Tell me all about our 
little trailer by the sea; Jessie, you could 
always sell any dream to me. " 

He had dial ability lo "sell" dreams to 



me. He could effonlessly make me believe 
lhat my life was wonderful, that my dreams 
were important, dial 1 would find happiness 
someday — all the things that a true friend 
does when they feel thai you need them. 

I miss having him around to make things 
seem brighter when they look their very 
darkest. 

I get choked up whenever lhat song hits 
ihe airwaves, because il reminds me of how 
much I miss him and how much I still worry 
about him after all these years. 

Some friendships truly change your life, 
and I think that having him in my 
life for even a shon lime changed 
me in some ways. 

Realizing lhat I have lost 
the source of that kind of confi- 
dence in my life makes me eternal- 
ly sad. 

Another song that puLs a 
lump in my throat is my wedding 
song. It's an obscure song by 
Vanessa Williams thai I chose for 
our "firsi dance" because il told die 
story of what finding my husband 
meant lo me. 

I chose a song dial I knew 
would never be overplayed by 
radio, and had never even been 
released lo stations. It felt "spe- 
cial," like it was ours and ours 
atone. Il wasn'l one of those "wed- 
ding songs" lhat gets used over and 
over and over. 

That is, it felt special until I heard Barbra 
Steisand's not-any where-near-as-good 
remake on a few weeks ago. Turns oui dial 
Babs had sung dial song at her own wedding 
to James Brolin earlier this month. 

Boy, was I licked off. Not only had she 
"stolen" our song, but she had remade il , in 
my opinion, badly. Suddenly our special 
song wasn't so special anymore. 




I'm don't hate Babs or anything, but I'm 
not loo happy lhat she "stole" my original 
and unique song and then butchered il. Okay. 
maybe it wasn't that bad, but it sure felt like 
it. 

My creativity had been stomped into the 
ground by Barbra Steisand, and I was not 
amused. 

My Barbra-Sieisand- induced anger is 
sure lo eventually subside, bul it jusi proves 
how much music means lo me. 

I attach melodies and lyrics lo all impor- 
tant things in my life, and hearing a song 
makes me remember things mat I thought I 
had forgotien. 

Music remembers what I can't always 
remember. 

Trisha Yearwood sings this in an appro- 
priaiely- titled number, called "The Song 
Remembers When": 

"Well, for all the miles between us. and 
for all the time that s passed, you would think 
I haven 't gotten very far; And I hope my hasty 
heart will forgive me just this once if I slop to 
wonder how on Earth you are... Still I guess 
some things we bury are just bound to rise 
again; For even if the whole world has for- 
gotten, the song remembers when. " 

It most certainly does.

OPINIONS 




Where have all the cowboys 
gone? I don't mean the Paula Cole 
song, and I sure don't mean the 
actual i. in k- wranglers. 

What I am talking about is the 
good, solid role models who have 
things more important to them than 
money and fame. People who aren't 
l wo- faced backstabbers and live like 
the people that they appear to be (o 
the public. 

Who do kids look up to today? I 
can tell you the person who is 



the endorsements: Michael Jordan. 

Here's a man who. no matter 
how many endorsements he gets. 
receives fax more money every year 
to play basketball than any other 
athlete around. Here's a man who 
acts "above" his sport by saying that 
he doesn't want (o play basketball 
for any other coach. I'm sorry, but 
that is not good sportsmanship. 

Another example from a few 
years is Kun Cobain. the big rock n' 
roll idol- 
who still

model. He was a drug addict who 
ended his own life. Oh, and he just 
happened to be a good guitarist. 

Today it also seems as if all the 
musical role models for kids arc rap- 
pers or wannabe gangsters. 

Are these the type of people that 
we really want our kids to grow up 
and want to be like? 

Years ago. kids had people such 
as Neal Armstrong, Roy Rogers, the 
president, Lou Gerig, Clark Gable 
and many other positive role models 
to call their heroes. 

Sure, most of them were finan- 
cially successful, but they we really 
good people. 

Why aren't there any of these 
types of people around anymore, 
and why aren't kids interested in 
them? 

If kids are interested in sports, 
then why don't they follow athletes 



The Crow's Warohest 



As many of you know, our 
Congress building was invaded 
recently by a "mad" gunman. 

Although he was basically 
insane and shot to pieces by the 
security guards at the Capitol, a lot 
of issues were raised by this 
assault. 

On the forefront now are ques- 
tions regarding the level of security 
in our nation's head office -- the 
place where the laws that govern 
the greatest and most powerful 
nation in the world are created -- as 
well as questions surrounding the 
level of security we allow in our 
nation and how such an offender 
should be tried. 

Although rumors of anti-gov- 
crnmeni groups have been around 
for years, little has really been done 
in way of legislation to prevent 
such attacks from occurring. 

However, it should be consid- 
ered that perhaps some of the best 
legislation that could ever be hoped 
to be passed has already been 
passed in the past. 

Or, to be clearer, the best legis- 
lation has already been approved 
that made such actions treasonous 
by those members it would effect 
the most - our central government. 

With that in mind, I believe that 



a direct assault, whether verbally or 
physically, on our Federal or State 
government officials should in fact 
be considered treasonous. 

The way I see it, if our govern- 
ment is under attack like that then 
their attention is drawn away from 
what they should be doing -- run- 
ning our country. 

This leads me to believe that 
such action should be punishable 
by death, and there are many rea- 
sons why I feel this way. 

First off, despite whatever has- 
sle our government gives us, who is 
really to blame for what our gov- 
ernment does? 

It'd be easy to blame the gov- 
ernment, but aren't we in charge of 
electing our government? 

I have as much chance being 
elected to the Senate as Senator Ted 
Kennedy does the way our 
Constitution is designed. 

Therefore, I see any threat to 
that chance as being not only a 
direct threat to my personal success 
but a direct threat on something 
that's survived 200 plus years to be 
the sole document in which the 
strongest nation in the world is 
governed by. 

Anything that is said against 
the United Stales Constitution and 



those that are its elected delegates 
and representatives I view as being 
an act against the welfare and secu- 
rity of our nation. 

After all, we did elect them and 
they're only doing what we tell 
them to. 

If they're doing something 
wrong, perhaps we're not keeping 
them busy enough but it definitely 
shouldn't be blamed upon the poli- 
cies that have governed our nation 
for over two hundred years. 

If we did that, we'd have to 
question the work of such patriots 
as Washington, Jefferson, 
Roosevelt (pick one), and Lincoln. 

While on the subject of 
Lincoln, it seems to me that he was 
the first of our "forefathers" to be 
assassinated. 

Although he was a government 
official, more concern was made 
over him being the President than 
was over his being a solitary gov- 
ernment official. 

Although his position is very 
respectable, being the sole speaker 
of our government and country, 
why would they make a bigger deal 
over his assassination than they 
would over the attempted murder 
of such people as Congressman 
Charles Sumner, who was assaulted 



like Ken Griffey, Jr. or John 
Stockton or Alexi Lalas? 

The answer is easy: Kids love 
the people who steal the show. They 
don't care about the people who put 
tic. m and soul into the game. 

As far as entertainment person- 
alities go, it seems as if all the kids 
flock to the "It" star of the moment 
like Matt Damon, Leonardo 
Dicaprio or Brad Pitt for the girls, 
and whatever chick seems to show 
the most skin for us guys. 

What's wrong with finding an 
entertainment idol who is more 
interested community service and 
helping people with their problems 
rather than just hoarding money and 
getting rich? 

People like John Travolta, Mel 
Gibson and Kim Basinger have all 
lent themselves out to worthy 



on the floor of Congress five or so 
years before Lincoln and beaten so 
badly he couldn't resume his duties 
for a few years? 

That doesn't make much sense 
to me, personally, as it'd seem to 
me that every government official 
that we elect to office is just as 
important as another. 

To think otherwise would go 
against one of the root principles of 
the Constitution of the United 
States ~ to maintain a balance of 
power amongst every branch of the 
government. 

But perhaps that is the same 
reason why Russell Weston, Jr., is 
only being charged with murder for 
killing security guards that got in 
the way of his killing members of 
Congress instead of being charged 
with direct treason. 

We place such a low value on 
people that we don't have to direct- 
ly elect than we do those who 
become the sole spokespersons of 
our nation. 

We'd rather leave it to the few 
thousand to mourn than we would 
the entire nation and completely 
right off the entire situation, despite 
the ramifications of the crime. 

We'd sooner let the few thou- 
sand vote in a new representative 



people 

who help us everyday like our par- 
ents, our educators or just that man 
who says hello to you everyday. 

These are the people who should 
be the most important to us. not 
some out-of-louch, over-rated actor 
or super athlete. These are the peo- 
ple who really change the world.

than to have to deal with having to 
watch a treason trial via the news. 

Human life in our country is 
that expendable, apparently -- if it 
doesn't directly effect us, then we'd 
rather write it off as a minor news 
story and continue eating our 
dinners. 

Well, I'm not quite sure about 
how everyone else feels about that, 
but 1 find it rather disgusting. 

If we're going to call an 
attempted assassination on the 
President treason, then we should 
just as well call an attempted assas- 
sination on any government official 
treason. 

And there is a big difference 
between treason and murder -- trea- 
son almost bought our country the 
farm when General Benedict 
Arnold sold out to the British in the 
Revolutionary War. after all. 

Any attempt to undermine the 
government should be labeled as 
treason. 

Without similar punishment for 
similar crimes, we can hardly call 
our system fair. 

And what is America supposed 

to be, if not fair?

By ADAM TAYLOR 
STAFF WfllTEH 



Surrounded by his isolation, Brian sal 
silently in his cabin watching ihe news. 

Nothing but the same thing every day 
he thought to himself as be walked over to 
answer bis telephone 

"Brian O' Connor doesn't live here any- 
more," he told the telemarketer with a smirk 
as be bung up ihe telephone. 

His sole entertainment seemed to come 
from giving (he mindless drones that 
plagued his phone lines at random the "run 
around," despite how little they called. 

Feeling dejected at amusement being 
gone from his life for another while, he 
resolved lo get some more work done. 

No place in the world could be more suit- 
ed for his work, Brian often reflected. 

Nestled up in the dense woods of North 
Carolina in a we 11- furnished home in the 
middle of no where seems perfect for the 
common scientist, and a scientist he was 
indeed. 

Skeptics often questioned the merit of 
parapsychology, mockingly calling Brian 
and his colleagues "ghostbustcrs" while 
punching their time clocks in the Research 
triangle near the capital, but Brian scoffed 
at their ignorance. 

The same people that mocked his pro- 
fession were the same people making thou- 
sands of dollars less than he was and were of 
the same breed that followed the trappings 
of astrology. 

Still, though, at least those people had 
the leisure to do what Brian only worked to 
do in his lime. 

That would explain the large amount of 
money Brian was looking at through his 
computer that represented his .savings. 



The best seller's list had been good lo 
him on more than one occasion, and yet he 
slill remained ihe same old Brian O' 
Connor. 

He slill surrounded himself with (he 
same dxab motif in the same isolated cabin 
not loo far from ihe Neuse River yei far 
from feeling whole. 

As be sat there staring at the vast 
amount of money on his computer screen, 
Brian decided ihe time had probably come 
for him 10 spend a lilde and go all out. 

Why not? He'd earned ihe money 
already, may as well spend ii. 

He therefore decided to call an interior 
designer in the morning and see whai could 
be done with his place and got back to work. 
The morning found Brian arising in a 
rather peaceful slate of mind. There was 
nothing like change to brighten a man's day, 
he thought lo himself as he got into his 
Miata. 

Brian loved his car a greal deal and 
found it to be perfect for his way of life. A 
single man with no want of family nor 
women couldn't ask for a belter car. 

ll was fast, it looked good, and it made 
the hours of commuting he underwent daily 
to get lo his office at Duke pass by like a 
summer shower. 

There were no signs of showers ibis 
summer day. though, as Brian made ihe turn 
off the inlerstalc and approached the univer- 
sity. Not a cloud in ihe sky. 

After three meetings and two appoint- 
ments, Brian decided lo make good on his 
promise to himself and call up an interior 
design expert that lived in his area. 

One of his colleagues lhat used to live 
near him gave him her number and said she 
was quite good, as well as quite beauiiful. 

The latier hardly mattered to Brian, as 
the lasi thing he needed was a woman to 
ruin the daily routine thai he had grown so 
accustomed lo. 



The bigger they are, the harder they fall 




However, he did want ihe best person 
for ihe job so he decided to give her a 
chance If things didn't work out. he decid- 
ed be could always find someone else in 
lime. 

After all, be had a lot of connections in 
the Triangle and any one of them would be 
more than willing 10 help him out 

Brian gave the lady a call, only lo get her 
answering machine. 

The line appeared to be a residential line 
as well as a business line, meaning she'd 
probably be in later lhat evening. 

Wilh lhai in mind, he grabbed his papers 
and left work knowing dial soon enough the 
wheels would be set in motion and he'd be 
looking at blueprinis by ihe end of next 
week. 

The drive home seemed to fly by pretty 
fast, but nol oul of anticipation, 

Brian couldn't stop thinking thai per- 
haps he was being too hasty in this abrupt 
decision to alter bis surroundings. 

Most people would consider such an 
action as being regular, and anyone with ihe 
kind of money Brian had would surely jump 
at the chance to make a few adjustments in 
their patterns of lifestyle - especially in 
something they lake so much pride in. 

Brian, however, was not like other 
people. 

He loved his life and everything about it 
and looked at change as a threat lo the well- 
being of ihe homeostasis he'd worked so 
hard to achieve. 

After years of working in the Research 
Triangle and after writing countless books 
about parapsychology, Brian felt as though 
his life needed little change. 

He was doing what he'd warned to do 
all of his life and doing ii quite well. 

Perhaps Ibere was a belter way for him 
lo spend his money besides completely 
altering his lifestyle. 

Then again, it really couldn't hurt any- 
thing 10 gel a few plans drawn 
up and get a few estimates from 



After all, he may even 
like whal she's selling lo him. 
Why not give it a try? 

The circle of his rational- 
ization found him sitting in bis 
driveway once again in laic 
evening, ready to give ihe interi- 
or designer a call, 

"Hello. You've reached ihe 
office of Coastal Paradise and 
the home of Annie King. No one 
is in to lake your call right now 
but if you'll please leave your 
name, number, and message 
someone will get back lo you as 
soon as we can. Thank you for 
calling." 

Upon hearing this message, 
Brian smiled and hung up. 

Perhaps it wasn't in the 
stars tonight, be figured, as he 
sat down on his couch 10 relax 
after a hard week's work. 

Nol even two hours later. Ihe 
phone rang, nearly scaring Brian 
half 10 death. 

It was far past the normal 
hours for a telemarketer to call, 
leaving Brian dumbfounded as 
lo whom il might be. 

Only a small handful of 
people would call him this late, 
he thought, and mosi of them he 
knew had plans lhat evening. 

As he picked up the 
phone, he was surprised to bear a 



A tree by Ihe campus gazebo lost a bout with Ihe wind during one ol the many 
recent slorms. 



familiar voice on the other end of the line - 
one he'd only heard on an answering 
machine. 

"Hello?" Brian answered with suspicion. 

"Hi, this is Annie King," ihe voice on the 

other line answered. "Dave ColLns gave me 

your number and said you were interested in 

doing a liille interior work in your home." 

"Yeah, I was thinking aboul it," Brian 
responded, nol really sure about what he 
was saying. "Dave lold me you were the 
righl person for ihe job." 

"1 like lo think so," Annie said with a 
laugh. "Depends on what you like, really, in 
my business." 

"Well, there's little doubl lhai I'd like to

calls?" 

"Yeah, I could stop by tomorrow if it's 
convenient for you. Say around one?" 

"Yeah, thai would be perfect, actually." 
"Great. I'll see you then, then. Talk to you 
later!" 

Brian relumed his closing and hung up, 
unsure about what exactly had just 
happened. 

Somehow, he'd been convinced into 
doing something he'd written off with the 
lasi pickup of Annie's answering machine. 

It really didn'l matter, though, as noth- 
ing was set in stone. 

Nothing was going lo change unless he 
consented to ii formally. These thoughts 
helped him sleep better that night, and he 
slept like a baby. 

Tomorrow, he figured, would be a big 
day in which his ability to negotiate would 
be called into play more than ever. After all, 
he hated change. 

The following morning, Brian arose to 
storm clouds. The weatherman said it prob- 
ably wasn't anything to worry about, but 
Brian knew better. 

Something big was brewing, just as he 
brewed up his coffee that moming. 

Carolina was gonna pay lhat day for all 
ihe good weather it had gotten away with so 
far that summer. 

One o'clock rolled around slow. Brian 
managed to gel a good deal of his "home- 
work" done for work while wailing for 
Annie to show up, as well as a few minor 
household chores. 

He was caught up to date on all the evils 
of the world via the news and fell quite con- 
fident thai he could handle an argument on 
what he needed to do in his bouse by the 
lime she finally showed up, slightly after 
one. 

After an hour or so of following her 
around his bumble (yei elaborately built) 
home. Brian sat down with Annie over a cup 
of coffee. 

Apparently, be was far out of fashion in 
his home upkeep, as she had a lot of sug- 
gestions lo offer. This didn'l hold well with 
Brian at all. 

"I really need all of lhat done?" Bnan 
asked in shock. 

"Honey, you don'i need to have anything 
done. However, if you want to be up-io- 
date. these things would help a good deal. It 
really wouldn't bother me one bit if you did- 
n't have anything done. Some people thrive 
on the past." 

"You're talking like I can't afford this. 
You know who I am, right? I've wrilten nine 
books, half of which were best-sellers. I'm 
just not too big on such a drastic change, 
you know?" 

"I know who you are and I know how 
much you're willing lo spend. And, like 1 
said, some people ihrive on the past. You're 
the type of person thai lives ihe same way 



every day, nine lo five job wilh your routine 
sei from the minute you wake up until ihe 
minute you decide to go lo sleep. You're 
bored with your life and you want a drastic 
change. I'm only here lo help you pull that 
off." 

"You sure are forward for someone dial's 
looking for work," Brian said callously. 
"Are you like thai with everyone you 
mcei?" 

"My apologies if my interpretation of 
your life offends you. However, if you don'i 
like it, then follow my advice and break this 
life of monotonous 'perfection' you Uy so 
hard to maintain. As 1 said, I could care less 
if you hire me on or not. I'm only interested 
in whai's best for you. and as I see it, this list 
is il," Annie said with every bit of sincerity 
she could muster. 

"Well, my apologies bul I don'i really sec 
ihe need for Ihe work. 1 do thank you for 
your time, though. Have a nice day." 

As he opened ihe door. Brian shot 
Annie a rude look lhai showed every bil of 
emoiional strife she caused him. 

There was little room for change in his 
life, and this woman wanted to change 
everything? How dare she. 

Despite what rationalization Brian pulled 
in dealing with Annie's suggestions, he was 
still ihinking about what she said hours after 
she'd left. 

The mere ihoughl dial his way of life 
might be a cop out or fake or whatever was 
all new to him. 

He'd always thought it the best way to 
live. His car reflected thai, as did his closest 
work relationships that made up his social 
life. 

Things like that had always been a 
gospel way of life to him, unquestioned by 
anything. And now there was a dissident 
whose views were too rational to go around. 

These things were on his mind for 
hours, as a storm approached Coastal 
Carolina thai would prove to threaten more 
than his way of life. 

A storm was approaching, as Brian had 
predicted. A storm that would knock out his 
only means lo keep his house from flooding 
a storm that would cause a flood that would 
change his life forever. 

It can be quite amazing, after all, what 
nature can do to influence the concrete 
minds of humans. Especially in dealing with 
humans that think they're belter than every- 
thing else. 

The storm came quite fast, though, con- 
sidering what damage it did lo Brian's life. 

Il caused the Neuse River to flood like a 
small creek after only a matter of hours, and 
Brian felt its impact long before then as he 
witnessed the flooding occur. . 

In the aftermath of the storm, as the 
river continued to swell, Brian saw too 
much of his life's work go underwater and 
into the flood. 

After only a matter of minutes. Brian 
realized something. Perhaps bis world was- 
n't as concrete as he believed il to be. 

Everything, he realized, was subject to 
change, whether good or bad. That was the 
one constant in life: everything changes. 

As the Neuse met iLs climax days later 
and he managed to sort through ihe things 
worthy of keeping after the water had 
claimed its victims, Brian made a phone 
call. 

The phone call would change his life 
forever, although he didn't realize ii at the 
time. 

All that was said to the answering 
machine he got was, "Annie, it's Brian 0' 
Connor. I believe it's time for a change."

As a former student and associate faculty 
member of IPFW, Dave Latchaw has definitely 
put his degree to good use since his graduation in 
1985. 

Latchaw is a piano and keyboard player who 
originated from the Kendailville area. 

Having studied with many gifted instructors 
over the years that have included such talents as 
Bruce Thomas of the Omette Coleman Band, 
Greg Hopkins of the Buddy Rich band, Dr. David 
Kay. and Brian Derek, Latchaw has learned from 
his many mentors and has capitalized upon his 
education to become an international sensation. 

After getting his degree in music education 
from Indiana University, Latchaw traveled over- 
seas to eventually join a Scottish rock band called 
The Heat. 

The Heat became an instant success in the 
British Isles, receiving multiple accolades from 
such hot British magazines as Kcrrang. Metal 
Hammer, and Raw. 

They were even recorded by the BBC, 
Britain's major media broadcaster, in a session 
that was aired on Radio One. 

Reluming to America after his stint overseas, 
Latchaw managed to gain success as a jazz 
pianist as well as a composer and musical educa- 
tor within the area. 

He also joined a handful of jazz trios, one of 
which was asked to perform at Plosk, Poland, 

This gave him the opportunity to play with 
Polish jazz musician Krzysztof Kralka and the 
vocal group Anuria from Belarus 

These days, Latchaw is a private instructor as 
well as a teacher at a few universities in the Fort 



Wayne area. 

He was a professor of 
Jazz theory at Huntington 
College in 1996 as well as 
the featured artist in 
lPFW's Jazz Ensemble 

He eventually made it 
back to IPFW again as pro- 
fessor of Aural Perception 
during the 1997-98 school 
year. 

He then left for a posi- 
tion as professor of Jazz 
Theory at Grace College, 
where he currently teaches. 
He also has a new CD in 
stores entitled 

"Reflections." 

"Reflections" is a col- 
lection of piano pieces 
recorded live one Monday 
afternoon in March. 

Of the 18 songs record- 
ed on the CD, only four 
were previously composed 
pieces- the rest were 
improvised during the ses- 
sion. 

"Reflections" can be 
found at the following 
locations: all five Wooden 
Nickel locations, all three

tions, Recycled Music in

'Private Ryan' new approach to war dramas 



Bv Kelly Bergman 

Managinq Editor 



Orson Welles said that "Film is life at twen- 
ty-four frames per second." As an avid filmgo- 
er and filmmaker, I have long used this as my 
manua . 

Until last weekend 1 did not fully get the 
grasp of the importance of film to our society. 

No matter how many classes I took that 
involved film or communication, none could 
explain to me what film meant to our society or 
how much it really reflected life. 

It wasn't until I saw what must be one of the 
best films ever made thai I came into what alco- 
holics would call a "moment of clarity." 

The film that made me realize what film is 
really supposed to be is Steven Spielberg's new 
masterpiece Saving Private Ryan. 

First off, I have to admit that when I saw 
who was in the film I wasn't loo interested in 
seeing iL When I think of Tom Hanks, 1 think of 
him as he was in Apollo 13 or Thai Thing You 
Do. 1 was also not about to go see a movie that 
has Matt Damon in it. 

What drew me to the film was the new 
approach to war films Instead of 
following the paths that Oliver 
Stone look with Platoon. Martin 
Scorcese took with Apocalypse 
Now and Stanley Kubrick took 
with Full Metal jacket, Spielberg 
look a more realistic and gritty 
approach to portraying World War 



under eighteen (The R rating means that people 
under the age of eighteen must be accompanied 
by an adult anyway) or have just had an interest 
in the actors from their previous works. 

Using these people as support for their crit- 
icism is just plain ignorant. 

For the first part, the film isn't really suited 
for people under eighteen due to the content of 
the subject. 

Secondly, actors should not be judged or 
lypccast by their previous work and be expect- 
ed lo play the same types of roles. 

The people dial do expect that are going lo 
be lei down every lime an actor lakes a different 
type role. 

Lastly, the people who feel that this film is 
bad simply have no ground to stand on, as this 
film is the best depiction of real war lo date. 

The film is well-suited for people who love 
drama and horror. 

The story is full of ups and downs and some 
occasional twists and turns. 

Fans of horror will enjoy the iwenty-five- 
minute opening bailie scene that depicts a batal- 
lion'sarrival to lake ihe shores of Omaha Beach 
during the invasion of Normandy. 



It is full of the grotesque realities that many 
men faced when ihey had lo make their way up 
that beach fifty-two years ago. 

If you haven't gotten the hint yeu this film 
is not suited for children. 

The other weapons that critics use to make 
the film less of a masterpiece includes making 
it sound as though the film is emotionless. 

This is just another thing that I am going to 
have lo say "phooey" lo. 

I went lo the film with my 76-year-old 
grandmother and another friend of hers; both 
were in World War II and they cried for belter 
than seventy percent of the film. If ihere was 
one film thai would be given five siars, this 
should be iL 

On a final note 1 would like to say that I am 
proud of Spielberg for laking the lum from 
films he's done like Hook and some more of the 
all-ages oriented subjects and dig deep lo make 
the films that mean something more than just 
pure entertainment. I hope that he continues on 
ihis path he has taken. 

Spielberg said that people slopped trusting 
him over ten years ago, and to tell the truth, 1 
am just starting to trust him. 



II. 

Everything, from the storyline 
to the special effects, took the 
glamour out of what Hollywood 
has previously exhibited as "war 
films," 

Not to say any of the afore- 
mentioned films were all that 
glamourous, bui most of the films 
from the 30s lo the 50s that starred 
people like John Wayne got people 
motivated; being active in the war 
was being "patriotic" and "honor 
able." These films didn't inform 
the public of the real horrors of 
war. 

That's exactly what Saving 
Private Ryan did: ll displayed Ihe 
horrors of war and, at the same 
time, allowed for a hero to devel- 
op- all without making ihe charac- 
ters any more heroic than what any 
other person would be. 

Mosi of the flack thai ihe film 
bas been getting from a few critics 
is due to mostly violence. Several 
writers who have been trying to 
tear down the film have been using 
moviegoers who have either been
