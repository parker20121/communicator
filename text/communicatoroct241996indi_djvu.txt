Mike War tell: A look at the chancellor 



by Jtrtmy Eccnbarger 

News Editor 

"What IS a chancellor?" 

This is the rcmark one siutleni made 
when asked if she was famdiar witb what 
Chancellor Mike Warlell does. Do 
not be surprised, for many siudenis. 
even those who have attended the 
campus for four years, do not know 
the names or actions tM:hind the 
label. 

According lo an ad placed in the 
local papers in 1993, the chancel- 
lor's job is 10 serve as chief execu- 
tive ofTicer o( the campus and report 
lo the president of Purdue 
University Purdue Dniversity m^- 
agcs all aspects of IPFW on behalf 
of both Indiana and Purdue universi- 
ties and also serves as the fiscal 
agent. 

Since July of 1994, Michael A, 
Wanell has clauned the role of chancellor at 
IPFW. Yet many students do not recognize 
Uie impact he has on the campus. 

Wanell 15 a member of the board of direc- 
tois of the Greater Ion Wayne Chamber of 
Commerce. Corporate Council, Leadership 
Fort Wa&gt;Tic and Fon Wayne Philharmonic 
He is also a member of numerous honorary 
societies and recipient of major research 



grants and academic awards. 

"If things go well there's no need for stu- 
dents to know their chancellors," said 
Wanell. 

Within his resiune. Chancellor Wanell 
summarized his vision of IPFW, "We will 
continue to build on our strengths, newly 
aware that while our mam primary mission 
will always focus on studenLs and dieir edu- 




cation, we must become to our community 
and region what we already are to our stu- 
dents. ..an invaluable resource." 

Wanell said that his main concerns lie 
within the community, while the vice-chan- 
cellors such a.s Frank Borelh. of student 
alTairi; Walter Branson, of fmancial affairs; 
and Fenwick English, of academic alTairs 
handle most of the campus-related 
problems. 



"The main focus of my job is ckveioping 
resources for the campus," said Wanell. 

Last spring, construction began on the 
new science building diat will cost the cam- 
pus S22.7 million to complete Already 
given nearly S18 million from the 
Indiana Legislature, Wanell is currently 
planning a presentation to ask for the addi- 
Uonal money. 

Odier projects that arc currently 
occupying much of his attention include 
developments that wUI be taking place 
on the McKay 
farm. This piece 
of land is locat- 
ed nghl off the 
north-west side 
ampus and 
will be used to 
add a new soc- 
field and 
youth education 
facility. In actu- 
ality, the facility 
will be another 
sports complex. 

Plus, funds are 
being raised lo sup- 
pon library technolo- 
gy. Constant organiz- 
ing efforts are also 
directed toward stu- 
dent activities and 
grants. 

Wanell IS also in 



charge of attaining partnerships with busi- 
nesses throughout the Fon Wayne area. 
Businesses like Fon Wayne National Bank, 
NBD Bank and Science Central have all 
been contnbutor^ to the campus 

"Our goal of campus community rela- 
tions is lo be involved with the community, 
not just pan of it," said Wanell 

Along with his professional duties. 
Wanell says he tries lo attend as many cam- 
pus events as po.wible In response to die fact 
that not many students know him. he says he 



knows students mvolved witb the student 
government, athletic events and theater 
because be acuvely attends their events. 

In a survey sent out to students, tbey 
offered many changes diey would lUte to see 
occur at IPFW Many of their ideas include 
more student recreaLonal activities, belter 
parking conditions aiul shident housing. 

"On a residential campus, tbc chancellor 
really doesn'l affect students' lives on cam- 
pus." said Wanell. "It's not easy to establisb 
a community on a coirunuier campus." 




A messy desk is a busy desk, and Chancellof Warlell couldn't be happier. 



Lecture poses different views of media 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
News EdKor 

Lighls, camera, action... Picture 
movie involving a small town 
school full of white children, except 
one. The one is an African- 
American girl whom students con- 
tinually victimize They throw 
stones at her on the playground and 
terrorize her with dieir threats The 
question is, who is being stereo- 
typed, ..the colored child or the 
white children in the film'' 

Last week. Multicultural 
Services hosted a lecture called 
"Elbnocentnsm and American 
Media" which brought questions 
such as this one into pcispective. 

"These are issues that people 
don't want to confront," said the 
speaker. N. Frank Ukadike, assis- 
tant professor of communication 
and Afro-American studies at die 
University of Michigan 

The event was sponsored by 
Multicultural Services, the depan- 
ment of communication and the 
French Club 



Around 30 people gathered in 
the Classroom-Medical Building, 
Room 159. on Thursday night, to 
hear Ukadike's theories on the sub- 
ject matter. 

"'I think faculty probably could 
have done more to encourage stu- 
dents to attend." said Christine 
Patterson, director of Multicultural 
Services. "The subject involves so 
much class inaienal. " 

Fihns ranging from "The Liide 
Drummer Boy" to "True Lies" were 
viewed in order lo attain some 
knowledge and evidence of die 
issues. While the ■Little Drummer 
Boy" was considered to stereotype 
middle eastern people, the 
Schwarzenegger film seemed lo 
show dial all Arabs were terrorists. 

According to Ukadike, people 
watched "True Lies" and laughed at 
the violence being brought upon the 
Arab, He said thai they are tradi- 
tionally stereotyped as being either 
rich and snobby, a terrorisi or 
involved in slavery 

"They (the audience) don't real- 
ly lake a close look at how the 



images are being portrayed." 

In fact, durmg the Oklahoma 
bombings, said LHcadike, many peo- 
ple tried to blame the Arabs in 
accordance wiib what they view in 
movies and television. 

In another Film tilled "Imitations 
of Life," critics claimed thai it slan- 
ed a period when Afro-Americans 
began playing positive roles. 
However, Ukadike claimed they 
only pictured colored women as a 
lype of "Aunt Jemima"-looking 
character as seen in the film. It 
depicted die women as the "happy 
servants." 

"What is Hollywood trying to 
convey?" Ukadike asked the listen- 
ers 

As the night went on, Ukadike 
conlmued analyzing several fihns 
and ihe characters the directors tried 
to convey. Many of his ideas 
brought the listenen into heated dis- 
cussion. 

"People just see diings in differ- 
ent perspec lives," said Ukadike. 




Future class lectures extend 
to cyberspace this spring 



by Jeremy Ecenbarger 
News Editor 

The computer age has gone to 
further heights No longer will siu- 
denls have to attend class lo receive 
a professor's lecture. Classes of the 
future simply require students to 
turn on their computer screens. 

In die spnng of 1997. students 
can lake a course, "Education and 
Inequality," offered by the depan- 
mcnt of sociology and anthropology, 
which will be die fu^t class on cam- 
pus to be given completely over the 
IntemeL 

"We hope lo make it a prototype 
for oiher classes." said Deb L 
Sewards, instructional and techno- 
logical coordinator for the school of 
arts and sciences, who is helping 
with the class. 

With die new process. Sewards 
and Peter ladicola. the professors of 
ihc class, feel dial the Iniemei will 
open many doors lo students of 
every field The Internet allows stu- 
dents to research a number of male- 
rials that once may have been diffi- 
cult 

"Some people inay want to get 
Uieir whole degree Ibis way." said 
Sewards. She says that diis would be 
a great way for teachers to get re- 
certified. 

The course explores the relation- 
ship between systems of social strat- 
ification and elementary and sec- 
ondary education It will present 
systems of siralification (social 
class, gender and race ethnicity) and 
discuss their impact on chddren's 
lives. 

The princip;^ focus is on school- 
ing in the US However, the educa- 
tional systems of odier culiures wUl 
be included in discussion. 

A deeper focus will be on inter- 
nal classroom practices that main- 
tain and increase differences 



between children of different social 
classes, genders or ethnic posiUons 
The class wdl study this by viewing 
the different testing techniques, 
tracking systems and uses of class- 
room compeution in schools 
duoughoui ibe country. 

Students who wish to take the 
course must have Inlemei access 
and be able to use Netscape They 
wdl discuss and debate the readings 
and noies via the elecironit discus- 
sion groups over the Internet. 

Students will also participate in 
asynchronous dLscussion via a bul- 
letin board formal on the World 
Wide Web. Lecture and library 
reserve material will be presented 
over the Internet for di.scussion 

The class will meei every 
Monday from 7:30-yp,m,. even 
though all class work is done on die 
computer. The time wdl be used for 
chat rooms, where guests who are 
teachers, theonsis and researchers 
will be avadable to discuss the work 
3S it relates to tbc class. 

"It's just a blocked off time, so 
students will be available," said 
ladicota. 

Using the chat rooms, students 
will not only be able to listen to 
guesl speakers, but they will have 
die opportunity to ask diem ques- 
Lons- Books will not be necessary. 
all information is available on 
screen. There will also be fdms for 
students to watch on the computer 

The class offers many other 
umque aspects. Students wdl fill out 
the general insiructor evaluation 
over the computer. In addition, stu- 
dents will make a student profile of 
themselves that includes their per- 
sonal infurmauon and a photograph 
Therefore, paniapanis wdl have ihe 
opporiunity to learn a lot more about 
dieir fellow students. 

"They may know their students 
even more than they would in a ira- 



ditionaJ classroom." said Sewards. 

Another benefit in the process is 
the faci thai sludenis wdl have the 
opportunity to work "bai&gt;d m hand" 
with ibeir professor, any lime they 
have difficulties Through software 
much like e-mad. die professor will 
communicate with each studenL 

"The class is very labor inten- 
sive," said ladicola. "1 work with 
each student individually." 

Under these circumstances, only 
20 sludenis are able to lake the class 
at a lime. 

The course numbers for 
"Educauon and Inequality" are 
CS410 for undergraduate students 
and CS560 for graduate students

Journey to Diversity 



The '^eSUS freaks': a view of Christianity, part 1 



by Brock Ervir 
Staff Writer 

The fundamenial Chrislian 
beliefs arc good grounds to base 
one's morals, but how many people 
still cringe ai the sound of TV evan- 
gelism, or avoid discussing topics 
of Christianity — including some 
Christians? I( is this topic thai I 
would like lo discuss, because [ 
think ttie reason for this reaction is 
the most misunderstood and unap- 
preciated pan of Christianity 

First, allow me to explain the 
basic beliefs of a Chnstian. The life 
of Christians today hasn't changed 
very much in belief Chriiiians 
believe that God created man, and 
Jesus came lo earth a.s a living tes- 



timony that God IS real In the 
course of his some 30 years, he per- 
formed miracles such as healing [he 
sick, blind and crippled He 
changed water inio wine He fed 
hundreds from seven loaves of 
bread and three fish Me taught (bat 
we should love each other, even our 
enemies, as much as we love our- 
selves. He laughl mercy, unselfish- 
ncss. humility, piety and honesty 
and he lived it He accepted death 
at a cross He ascended into hell, a 
sinless man. to bear the punishment 
for our sins He came back to life to 
fulfill what Scripture said would 
happen All this, Jesus did so that 
we may live clemal life in heaven 

In addition to preaching about 
salvation. Jesus told us lo go out 



and spread the Word. Why' It 
should be obvious. He wanted 
everyone lo have the chance to 
know Him and have eternal life He 
wanted us to share a good thing. So. 
for some faithful Christians, 
spreading the Word of God is not a 
choice, 

For some, however, it is a 
choice These are the so-termed 
"Jesus freaks" of our day. This term 
may sound negative, but for some 
Christians it is a compliment like 
no other. These so called "freaks" 
find an incomparable joy m doing 
what God tells us, in awaiting their 
rewards in Heaven, and in living a 
Christian lifestyle. For a Chrisiian 
knows, as God has said, that they 
should work for their nches in 



Heaven and not on Eanh. So to 
have the opportunity, with or with- 
out ridicule, to share with someone 
the awesome feeling of joy. love 
and salvation that God wants to 
give to all of His people, is what a 
"Jesus freak" looks forward to 

So, in this diverse world there 
live the "Jesus freaks" and thai is 
what they believe. I hope that this 
has enlightened you. at least in a 
small way, as to why some 
Christians do the things they do I 
also hope dial you feel a htlle dif- 
fcrendy about ihe next lime you see 
someone wearing a shin that says. 
"Life's short, pray hard" Who 
knows? When the end comes, it 
might just be the Chrisuans who 
weie right after all. 



Stores offer something FRIGHTENING JCtathoug'S^ 



by Kebecca Koenig 
Staff Writer 

Last year, you waited until the day before the big 
Halloween Pany lo even begin lo plan your costume. 
Your ghost costume consisted of a Hollie Hobbie bed 
sheet with two holes cut in it for eyes. During the party 
you [ripped over the shcci and went sprawling into a 
dancing couple The only ]nze you won was Checsiest 
Costume. This year will be differenL 

\VTiere do you go to get costumes? Several area 
siores carry Halloween supplies. Arc all stores the same? 
No. When looking for a good Halloween store, consider 
the decor of the store, ihe merchandise available, cus- 
tomer service, and the quality for your money 

It seems nothing sparks Halloween creativity hke a 
ghoul's bloody eyes sianng blankly at a shopper The 
mood of a well -decorated stoie somehow makes people 
envision Halloween horrors. Costume stores often have 
elaborate Halloween displays lo showcase their mer- 
chandise, 

Freddy Kruger smirks from the window of Spencer's 
Gifts, located at Glenbrook Square, Below Kniger's 
bloody glove is a brigbdy lil sign informing people pass- 
ing that Spencer's is America's Halloween 
Headquarters. The fastest way to a man's heart is with 
a pick ax, says [he Crypt Keeper to customers entering 
Ihe store Spencer's has gone to great lengths to give this 
stoR' the true fevling of Halloween. 

Stoner's Funslore located on the comer of Mam 
Streci and Harrison Streei is also we 1 1 -dec orated 
Employees are siill in the process of designing displays 
for the store's windows, and each day a new dreadful 
sight is added. In the comer of the window, a bloody rat 
watches, covered m spider webs. 

After a display sets ihe mood of Halloween shop- 
ping, it becomes important for the store lo have a vari- 
ety of merchandise for the consumer. Stoner's has Ihe 
merchandise to back up its display. Both the Hamson 
Streei store and Ihe Coldwater Road store have rubber 
masks, wigs, costumes, makeup and props to purchase 
The Harrison Street siore has many more wigs and a 
larger selection of professional makeup. They reni. m 
addition to selling costumes. 

The most popular cwstumes have masks which cover 
the whole head according to De Sloner, one of the 
store's owners Among others, Stoner's has raccoon. 
penguin, skunk, bee and gorilla costumes of ihLs style. 

Bill and Hillary Clinton are some of the costumes for 
rem at All Occasion Pany Rem located on Speedway 
Drive. The store also has several coMumes aiKl masks 
for sale. 

There's usually some kind of costume that we can 
help someone put togelher, says Kelli Mabe. the owner 
and manager of All Occasions. 

Celebrate Halloween Costumes and Accessories, a 
temporary specialty store, is also well-stocked with 



Halloween supplies. Celebrate Halloween is located on 
Cohseum Boulevard near Pamell Avenue. 

Once looking ai the merchandise, il is nice to have a 
professional to discuss ideas with The staff at All 
Occasions seemed knowledgeable and happy lo help 
tbeir customers. Mabe was willing lo discuss one cus- 
tomer's Halloween plans even though he made it known 
he was still gathering ideas. This type of individual 
attention helps each customer make a success of his 
plans. 

One of the toughest stores lo get individual service is 
Spencer's The store seems to be understaffed Many 
mall shoppers are atbacied to Spencer's by the decora- 
tive wmdow Once mside. there were too many cus- 
tomers for the few salespeople to attend Customers are 
left to browse through the bloody masks themselves, lis- 
tening to Ihe Crypi Keeper explain, "the Morgue the 
Merrier!" 

Many consumers may noi want to mvest in an expen- 
sive costume which ihey may only wear once, WalMan 
on Coldwater Road could be the answer to this While 
Wal Man does not carry tJie same variety of costumes 
and accessories as some oiher stores, what they do carry 
is affordable Adult-sized costumes for a clown, wizard 
and gnm reaper are all in Ihe S15 lo S20 range. Rubber 
masks are S4,97. Similar pumpkin lights can be found at 
Wal Mart for S3 97 or Cetebiate Halloween for S8 99 

Another co,st-culler at Halloween is renting as 
opposed to buying a costume. All Occasions and 
Stoner's both rent costumes for Halloween Prices for 
renting vary, depending on the costume Renting noi 
only saves the consumer money, but enables him to 
afford a higher qualily cosmme. According to Mabe, 
most of Ihe business done at All Occasion's is through 
rentals. 

One alternative to buying or renting a cosnjme is 
making your own. According to Mabe, the costumes 
people make are often the most unique. The local 
Halloween siores are a good way lo generate ideas for a 
homemade costume. Also, several books may be of 
assistance Books contain ideas as simplistic enough for 
children or complex enough to appear professional. One 
simple costume found in 'The Fantastic Costume Book" 
by Michelle Lipson &amp; Fncnds is sour grapes. 

Thus costume consists of purple balloons attached to 
a sweal-suit. More complex costumes can be found in 
"Costumes for You to Make" by Susan Purdy. This book 
contains careful directions on making a cosmme of 
George and Martha Washington, Greek and Roman sol- 
diers and many others. 

Finding the nght costume for the Halloween party 
this year can be as easy as walking to die local costume 
store and renting everything you need or as complex as 
hand making your own costume. The important thing to 
remember is if you expect to win "Best Cosmme" 
instead of "Cheesiest Costume," now is the time lo stan 
looking.

for the beneHl of big tobacco. 

Sure cigarette companies prey 
on children and tax our Medicare 
and Medicaid systems wiUi lung, 
moudi. throat and stomach cancer, 
bronchitis and emphysema as well 
as miscarriages, still-births, pre-

drome, but so what? 

Dole, for example, takes huge 
piles of money from Gallo wine 
Souder takes booze money, too 

Alcohol, taken in large quanti- 
ties, may help temporarily dull the 
pain of cancer, bronchitis, emphy- 
sema, the pain over losing children 
and the burden of taxation on those 
who don't contnbute !o the health 
problems that tobacco companies 
promote for their own personal

out, sort of. , .

Next we would like to thank

Life's contribution is especially 
amazing when you consider all the

One person whose contribution

been given any credit for his help

Without any of these people, 
Dan Butler would not have come to

There is no risk 
in saymg that the

How about society? Does it play 
a role in making this image? This 
question came across given that 
some believe that the media aaual-

the next largest is Nigeria, In his 
explanation, he said most students 
do not know this fact because the 
media does not educate American 
Society about the contributions of 
African countries to the US, 

Instead, the media deliber- 
ately depicLs Afnca as a savage jun- 
gle. He added that African society 
is presented as uncivilized and 
primitive. Images of African- 
Americans or Afncans in American 
media contain heavy ideological 
distinctions which dcfuie the differ- 
ence between while and black. 

Stuan Hall, m his 1995 article. 
"The White in Their Eyes." states. 



abandoned or rejected. Media, 
indeed, reach large audiences and 
bnng them to the dynami.sm of 
democracy. 

I agree with Ukadike that the 
American media have created false 
images of Africans. I do not agree, 
however, when he says that stu- 
dents do not know the role of 
Africans in this country due to 
media ignorance. I do believe that 
curricula in schools are supposed to 
cover this matter, including eco- 
nomics, history, geography and pol- 
itics. It can be assumed that media 
work on their own agenda, which in 
turn, depends upon the ideology of 



the country in which tbey are situ- 
ated, 

Herman and Chomsky state that 
the American mass media has 
deHned their ideology based on 
US, political interests and also 
based on the entrepreneur's need of 
a media monopoly. Therefore, the 
expectations of American mass 
media caiuiot simply be assessed by 
using other ideologies 

Ukadike said many people 
know about Kenya because of its 
wild animals including hons, tigers 
or monkeys. Kenya's iniage, creat- 
ed by Hollywood in films like "Out 
of Africa" or "Congo." are 
absolutely false He remarked Uiai 
he had never seen a hon until he 
visited a zoo in England. 

A similar event has happened to 
me; people equate my country. 
Indonesia, with rain forests and 
wild animals This was not the case. 
however, when media news con- 
firmed to the public that the nehesi 
Indonesians contribute money to 
the CUnton campaign. 

I am concerned that racism still 
continues in American society and 
mass media involvemeni strength- 
ens this condition. 1. nevertheless, 
prefer to see a different side of the 
problem I believe in order to 
counter US media and the Third 
World countries, including 54 
African countries and Indonesia, 
they need to correct themselves 

These countries do not use their 
media to produce good movies and 



and dramas which culturally and 
cally can introduce the "real" life of 
their society 

Most governments of African 
and Asian counlnes decided the 
role of mass media in their own 
interests This causes a limitation of 
creativity in producing high quality 
movies or dramas that can break 
into American markets 

Because of poor quality local 
entertainment production, most 
African and Mian countries import 
Hollywood movies and television 
series. This of course, strengthens 
the dommance of Western ideology, 
which they believe is heavily racist 

Japan, China and India are good 
examples to follow These coun- 
tries have produced movies and 
drainas which are appreciated in the 
Amencan market. They have built 
their culture and beliefs in 
American society In fact, the 
stereotypical images of Japanese 
and Chinese have changed from 
gangsters to protectors, and some- 
times heroes 

Afncan and Asian countries can 
imitate the spirit of Jewish enter- 
tainers in gaining ethnic pride, This 
point of view intends to empower 
human resources and human needs. 

Thus, people can maintam pride 
as human beings who are equal in 
every sense of life and cuhurc. This 
will result m giving a lesson \o peo- 
ple who are very narrow-minded in 
valuing human beings, such as 
some of the people in Hollywood.

Mastodons win one, lose one 



by S. Brant Kelley 
Sports Editor 

The Mastodons finally put an 
end to their mid-season losing 
streak, but not before digging them- 
selves a deep hole in the Great 
Lakes Valley Conference standings 
with another loss to the league's 
last-place squad. 

IPFW scored three goals in the 
second half against Huntington 
College lasl lliursday to pull out its 
first win in sm matches. But just 24 
hours earlier, the Mastodons suf- 
fered a two-goal loss to Kentucky 
Wesleyan University, giving the 
Pumas their first GLVC win this 
year and putting IPFW in an even 
worse position prior to the confer- 
ence tournament. 

"It was the worst game we 
ever played." IPFW coach Terry 
Siefankiewtcz said. "We didn't sup- 
port each other . We were back on 
our heeb " 

The Pumas scored their first 
goal in the llrsl half, beatmg 
replacement goalkeeper Dennis 
Gi:rmann, and again with jusl a 
minute lo go in the match to pull the 
match out. 2-0. 

When asked why German 
replaced Matt Schmitz in goal, 
Stefankicwicz replied that be was 
mating things up lo improve results 

"We were on a four-game losing 
streak. ' he said. "We tried to make 
a change, and il jusl didn't work 
out." 

IPFW was held scoreless despite 
keeping the ball in the opponent's 
half of (he field much of the second 
half The loss dropped IPFW to 3-6 
in the GLVC, 5-9 overall. 

The next evening, the 
Mastodons finally pulled out of 
their slump with a 3-0 victory over 
Hunlinglon College for their first 



victory in six matches (and three 
weeks). 

Despite a 0-0 half-time score, 
the 'Dons thought they dominated 
the match up lo that point and were 
simply wailing lo break down the 
door, 

"We really weren't that con- 
ramed." Stefankicwicz said. "Wc 
played really well, we just didn't 
knock the ball m." 

Knock and the door shall be 
opened. IPFW broke the match 
open in the second half with three 
goals, two by Mike Harper and the 
other by David Smith 

"We knocked ihc ball around 
quite a bit." Stefankicwicz said.

VoUeydons set record, end streak 



E^QMEQMa 



by S. Brant K*lley 
Sports Editor 

The IPFW women's volleyball 
learn strcichcd iu scbool-record 
winning sHcak (o 16 matches, then 
i;aw ihc streak end, all last weekend 
ai the Tampa University volleyball 
toumaoieni. Before ii was over, ibe 
VoUeydons would win and lose 
another maich before reluming 
home [0 finish their conference «;a- 
son and prepare tor ihe Great l^es 
Valley Conference loumameni. 

According lo IPFW coach Tim 
Heffron, the VoUeydons have been 
in a playing funk spawned paidy by 
their cupcake-level GLVC competi- 
tion, against which they have lost 
only three games in nine matches. 

In the tournament's first inaich, 
the VoUeydons upstaged a mediocre 
Si Francis College of Illinois icam 
lo run its winning streak to 16 
matches, breaking the old record of 
15, set seven years ago. 

Despite iLs nominal opponent, 
II'I-W look four games to bcai SFC. 



15-7.15-6.4-15.15-5. 

"We've been slarling to slide in 
our performance," Heffron said, 
"and we've been getting away with 
iu" 

By the third game. SFC bad 
caught up with IPFW and made the 
VoUeydons pay for it 

"They made us adjust," Heffron 
said, "and I was a lilUc disappointed 
in the speed of our adjustment." 

After SFC, the VoUeydons suf- 
fered defeat for the first time since 
the second week of Ihc season 
E&gt;efcnding national champion Barry 
College came at the Dons without 
fear, despite being only a shadow of 
the team it once was. 

"(They] were nowhere near ibe 
athletes we were." Heffron said. 
"[But) they're getting the most out 
of their team." 

After taking a 6-0 lead in ihe firsi 
game. IPFW slid inio an uninspired 
mode and suffered from being 
"starstruck". according to Heffron 
The VoUeydons lost the match in 
three straight. 10-15. 11-15.7.15 



"At that point [6-0]. we just fell 
asleep," Heffron said. "For ihe first 
tunc since the first couple of weeks, 
when the other team challenged us, 
we didn't respond, we panicked." 

The Bany match proved fertile 
soil for learning, however, as Ihe 
'Dons rebounded the next match to 
defeat Rorida Southern University 
in five games. 6-15. 15-8, 15-9. 9- 
15, 15-11 

"The firii game, we just came 
out as an extension of ihe Barry 
match," Heffron said. "TTicn, starl- 
ing with the second game, we start- 
ed lo make the lumaround." 

"From that poini on. things gol 
betier. They're not back where they 
need to be, but they're betier" 

Wiih iwo straight game wins 
against theu* sliffest competition in a 
month, the VoUeydons suddenly 
relaxed, and ii almost cost them Ihc 
match 

"Then, the fourth game, we sud- 
denly get satisfied," Heffron said 

FSU wasn't satisfied and took 
game four. 15-9, forcing game five. 



The fifth game witnessed see- 
saw action between the two teams 
before FSU look an 11-9 lead. At 
that point, with neither team playing 
sleUar, the VoUeydons crossed the 
gul check Serving with ber squad 
behind 9-1 1, setter Amy Luben put a 
soft ace jusi over Ihe net, ihen IPFW 
finished a long rally to tie the game 

From that point, ihe VoUeydons 
controlled ihe match 

"I ihought, after thai rally, we 
could give them a ran for their 
money." Heffron said. 

Saturday evening matched Ihe 
VoUeydons up with the hosts. 
Tampa University, whom Heffron 
thought was ihc best team ihe 
VoUeydons faced this year. 

"They're a very solid Icam." 
Heffron said "Very skilled, very 
quick on defense " 

However, given another night 
and another location, Heffron said 
he thought IPFW could stay with 
Tampa. But this was Saiunlay night 
in their own gym. De.spite la,siing 
only ihree games, the match went 



over an hour and a halt 

With long rallies and an occa- 
sional error that usually went 
Tampa's way. IPFW slowly lost 
control of the match. 

"We passed very well," Hcfl^ron 
said. "(Bull u.sually the breakdown 
started with our passing." 

The ouiside hilling, for some 
time a concern of Heffron's. was 
finally bolstered by Frvshman Angie 
Robbins, who hi! .333 for the match. 

The middle once again proved an 
IPFW advantage; the VoUeydons hii 
only ,200 in the middle but held 
Tampa's middle to around zero per- 
cent for the evening. 

While the 'Dons did rediscover 
whal national caliber competition 
was like. Heffron saw the louma- 
ment as a wake-up call more than 
anything else. 

"The weekend was a loss of 
opporluniues." he said. "We just 
could nol execute when the oppo- 
nent was in a straggling position."
