"Every time we played a MAC school, coaches asked if we 
were interested," IPFW coach Terry Stefan tdewicz said. "It has 
been kind of in the works for the last two years." 

The MAC needed another team to make a total of sot, a 
minimum to keep tin- league eligible tor the NCAA tournament. 
Akron, Bowling Green, Buffalo, Northern Illinois and Western 
Michigan were the five soccer-playing teams in the MAC, until 
IPFW joined.

Red Cross blood drive on campus a success 

■ Blood drive increases available supply to an already imminent shortage of blood 




uMatitU I jmaititiriipfwo 

DONER: An IPFW student gives blood. 



Last Thursday, Sept. 22, the Red Cross 
held a blood drive with the backing of the 
IPFW Clerical and Service Staff Advisory 
Committee (CSSAC). 

According to Susan Humphrey, a 
member of the CSSAC, the goal number 
of 130 donations was set by the Red Cross. 
That number was exceeded considerably. 

"I was very pleased to see how many 
students did come forward on Thursday 
and were willing to stand in line to donate," 
Humphrey said. "Their dedication did not 
go unnoticed." 

The recent devastating hurricanes have 
redoubled the blood donations necessary 
for optimum health care. Monetary relief 



for Katrina alone Is estimated in excess of 
S2 billion with the Red Cross already having 
collected S808 million In gifts and pledges. 
Blood donations are equally important. 

Ample blood supply guarantees that 
hospitals will have the ability to treat all 
patients. A single accident victim in an 
emergency room requires, on average, no 
less than four units and as many as forty 
units of blood. 

In distributing the donations, the Red 
Cross satisfies local requirements first and 
then any excess is shipped to areas of need, 
such as the Gulf regioi 



s because of a shortage. A press

In an essay from her website "4000 Years 
of Women in Science," Deborah Crocker, 
professor of astronomy at the University 
of Alabama slates. "Access to scholars and 
information has always depended upon 
gender, location, birth, and luck." 

A recent study by the Bayer Corporation 
seems to confirm this and voices 
serious concern from parents about the 
opportunities available to minorities and 
females in science and engineering fields.

in science, technology, mathematics, and 

engineering related employment.

Making Sense program. It provided much 
needed public opinion about these issues. 

Parents in the Bayer survey called on 
the science and engineering community, 
schools, the government, and themselves 
to provide the information necessary to 
spark the interest of women and minorities 
in this job sector. Most supported the 
creation of community programs that 
would foster this interest. 

"Having a diverse workforce is more 
important than ever - especially since it 
underlies our ongoing abilities to invent, 
advance and discover," said Toulouse. 

Professor Thompson concurred, 
"Diversity has the capacity to strengthen 
not only the engineering profession but 
society as a whole by exposing us to points 
of view and backgrounds that we would not 
ordinarily experience. In our increasingly 
technological society, as the demand for 
engineers and technologists grows, we will 
have to drawn upon women and minorities 
to meet the need." 

Solomon Isiorho, chair of the IPFW 
Department of Geosciences also agrees, 
"Diversity is important to any field as it 
enriches the field through varied views." 

Isiorho's department has an admirable 
women majority of 62 percent making up 
the current student enrollment. In an 
attempt to connect with the community, 
"Geosciences faculty visit area high schools 
to give talks and also give departmental 
tours to students from kindergarten to high 
school." Isiorho said. 

Bruce Kingsbury, Chairman of the IPFW 
Biology Department, acknowledged the 
university's diversity initiatives and the 
Biology Department's desire to aid in their

diverse place in terms of gender, race, and

Other IPFW departm 
involved in community outreach. 
Thompson explained that "The School of 
Engineering, Technology, and Computer 
Science is actively involved in increasing the 
awareness of engineering as a profession. 
Our outreach office coordinates events 
including middle school career days, First 
Lego League Robotic competition. Future 
Cities competition, and many others." 

Some national organizations are also 
attempting to abolish the barriers that 
have been established in these fields. 
The National Consortium for Graduate 
Degrees for Minorities in Engineering and 
Science (GEM) recently announced the 
establishment of a collaborative effort with 
the National Science Foundation to offer 
graduate fellowships to underrepresented 
groups. The program strives to make it 
easier for these groups to achieve M.S. and 
Ph.D degrees in engineering and natural 



Americans, Mexican Americans, American 
Indians, Puerto Rican Americans, and other 
Hispanic Americans. 

ayer's Making Sense initiative also helps 
develop science literacy with applied, 
investigation-based learning with the 
help of volunteer employees and public 
education. There are 12 Bayer locations 
throughout the country that are involved 
in the initiative with a total of 1,000 
volunteers. 

Ignorance of any race or gender by a 
field can lead to disappointment. Crocker 
agrees: "When we, as scientists, wear 
blinders, about anything, we fail. I have 
never seen science succeed by using only 
one view, by using only one tool, by using

Summer blood shortages often result from the

This makes blood drives like the one last

Angel Mochel- Foster, coordinator of the AT

HIV and AIDS infections have not declined is 
because of a gap in knowledge and education 
about the deadly virus. 

Beginning in the early 1990s and continuing 
for about a decade, Mochel-Foster says that 
people became less vigilant about HIV and AIDS 
awareness, especially in schools. 

She also finds in her outreach work that about 
one in four people are uneducated about HIV.

Most important however, were those who 
donated their blood. Students, staff, faculty,

Tropical storms and hurricanes all have nifty, 
human names. Andrew, Katrina, Rita, Wilma...

lives. So, why does the World Meteorological

such unassuming names? Simply, lo make it less

Byzantine latitude-longitude system. This was 
very confusing as nightly news, newspapers, et 
al. began to report on hurricanes, so the cheeky 
naming system of common and human names 
began in 1953 with women's names only. 

In 1979, men's names were added to the list, 
alternating with the female names with the let- 
ters Q, U, V, X, Y, and Z being omitted as they 
didn't have enough options. Sorry Xerxes, no

Taste of Japanfor lunch casa earns 

"NCLCA award 



This fall, there are several eating choices 
on campus. Among them are Taco Bell, 
Pizza Hut and Subway. After four weeks 
of the semester, the IPFW community has 
an opportunity to get oriental foods from 
Yokohama Japanese Restaurant in the Neff 
Hall lobby from II a.m. to 1 p.m. Monday 
through Thursday. The IPFW community 
welcomes the foods from Yokohama 
because everyone wants to get more variety 
of foods on campus. 

In the first week of selling food from 
Yokohama, some students had not had the 
opportunities to try the oriental food. Neel 
Bola, freshman electrical engineering major 
said. "I graduated from Huntington High 
school. I did not eat food from Yokohama 
Japanese Restaurant yet but I am going to 
have my lunch for next week because I can 
get reasonable price with healUiy food." 

Upsilon Pi Epsilon International Honor 
Society for the Computing and Information 
Discipline sponsored this opportunity on

Wai is a vice president for the Association 
of Burmese Students and he began to 
eat at Yokohama because his close friend 
recommended it for dinner after she ate 
there. "I always eat Maiko Bneto for dinner 
because it comes with Shrimp Tempura." 
The Shrimp Tempura roll is popular and

Ma Aya Oo, a sophomore electrical

Staff Editorial 

Last Friday, the men's soccer 
team was added to the Mid- 
American Conference effective 
immediatly. While on the outside 
this move seems beneficial for the 
University, it does not accomplish 
what the department is seeking. 

Since IPFW became a Division 
I program four years ago. Athletic 
Director Mark Pope has worked 
every day on getting all of the 
departments' programs into a 
conference. 



Instead of getting all 15 teams 
into either the Mid-Continent 
Conference or Horizon League, as 
sought, the school now has only 
four teams in conferences. 

The men's volleyball team (Mid- 
American Volleyball Association) 
and women's soccer (United 
Soccer Conference) are not even 
part of traditional conferences. 

The men's tennis program is 
already a member of the MAC 
confercncu*. With the addition of 



men's soccer to the MAC, there are 
now three different conferences 
that IPFW has an affiliation with. 
Some teams, such as the women's 
track program, thrive in sendng 
players to the independant 
Championships regularly. 

Not havingme full set of athletic 
programs in the same conference 
could potentially lead to greater 
problems in leaving sporatic 
conferences to consolidate later 
on in coming years.

Campus makes 
difference with 
Mini Dons 



First Name Basis 

By Megan Tiffany 

mtiffany@ipfwcomrnunicator.org 



Mini Dons has been helping children across 
the Fort Wayne area make friends, have fun, 
and learn about soccer for three years. And this 
wouldn't be possible without II'RV soccer coach 
Terry Stefankiewicz. He founded the program to 
teach area children about his passion, soccer. 
There are other benefits that have arisen from 
the Mini Dons program as well. 

Obviously, the program starts with the kids. 
This year there are over -Kith Mil Jr. mi. kindergarten 
through fourth grade, that participate in the 
program. There could have been a thousand, but 
there was a lack of funds. You see, Mini Dons is 
a non-profit and volunteer organization. There 
is no fee for the children to participate. All the 
money is donated by several foundations ,im\ 
organisations in i he area. Although they receive a 
large sum of funds, we all know that money goes 
quickly. With the money received, each player 
obtains a soccer ball, a shirt, socks, and a pair of 
shorts Also with the money, the program buys 
goals, uniforms, and anything else that may be 
needed. 

Although it is first-come-first serve due to 
the insufficient funds. Mini Dons provides all 
children an opportunity to play. It is especially 
great for the children that could not afford other 
programs. 

Coach Stefankiewicz says that they also 
get many mentally challenged and disabled 
children. Many other programs do not provide 
those children with an opportunity, which Mini 
Dons does. Mini Dons teaches all the children 
how to play soccer, the rules of the game, and 
sportsmanship When it i omes to game time it is 
not about winning for the kids, it is about having 
fun and working together. Winning is purely a 

Mini Dons has also provided the soccer 
teams of IPFW a chance to give back to the 
community, as volunteers and team members 
run the program. The soccer teams enjoy this 
program just as much as the children do. They 
create friendships with the kids and get to teach 
others about the sport they love. Also, there 
is self-satisfaction of helping others, and Mini 
Dons provides that satisfaction. 

Mini Dons has surpassed everyone's 
expectations and has become a true success. 

It has made a difference in every participant 
and volunteer's lives. The children have fun and 
grow to love something.

Caprille: Unsung Hero 



Piero Caprille may be a new name to the 
fans of IPFW Division I sports, hut it shouldn't 
be What isn't in the stat book is seen on the 
field. Beginning his second, yet senior season 
for the men's soccer team, Caprille is a steadily 
improving player looking to make an impact 
on the soccer team's inaugural season in the 
Mid-American Conference. 

Previously a midfielder at Tyler Junior 
College in Tyler, Texas, he helped his team 
to a No. 1 ranking nationally among junior 
colleges and a second place finish in the 
NICAA Division I tournament. 

After the 2003 season with (he Apaches, 
Caprille's coach from Tyler Jui '

college teams, San l,i&lt; into College and Tyler

Division 1 NCAA play was fairly easy: "My first 
game was against Indiana University. It was a 
bit ot'.i wake up. i played lor two really talented 
teams, but playing against II) was definitely 
more intense. I here were seven thousand 
people there, im Mist game lor IPFW. There 
was a lot of excitement. It was challenging. 
and the tempo seemed much more upbeat." 

Caprille wouldn't see action for very long, 
however. Various injuries during the Soccer 
Showcase last season kept him off the roster 
and on the sidelines h.i the middle part of the 

season, but he red ded Inwards the end of

Only a Tew games into the 2005 season, 
Caprille has already made great strides in 

improving his overall performance. 

"I weigh a lot more than I did when 1 first 
began college." Caprille said. Tie put on about 
20 pounds of muse le. I am in the weight room 
a lot." 

Coach Tern, Stcfankiewicv likes what he 
sees in Caprille and hopes that lie will continue 
to improve and add to the strength of the 
program in his senior season: "He distributes 
the ball very well. He is a shorter, stockier 
player. He makes good decisions with the 
ball. In one-on-one defense, sometimes he 
lets his man get In him. If he can hold his man 
defensively, then he can be a big force on the 




HARDLY HEARD OF: Piero Caprille, the player who often goes unseen to many 
even die hard Mastodon fans, takes the ball up the field against Winthrop at 
the IPFW Invitational earlier this month 

In discussing individual performance, 
Caprille's attitude as a team player shines 
through: I just try to do as much as the team 
needs, whatever the coach is asking for, just 
try to keep the guys up and play well with 
everyone." 

Described as an unselfish player by 
Stefankiewicz, his personal goals blend 
completely with those ot the leant: "I am not 
much of a stats guy, I like lo help the team 
whether the pass before the assist or 



whatever. Our goal a

Although 0-1 currently in die conference, die 
Masiodons' only loss in their new conference is 
to the sixth ranked team in the nation, Akron. 

"Against Akron, we played them real well m 
the first half." (.aprille said 'lust little things: 
referees, a bad call, a bad pass that killed the 
chemistry of a game kind of hurt us. We can 
play with everybody, it's just a matter if we can 



We feel very confident in the conference that 

And there arc plenty of games left for that 
to happen. 

"We are hoping that once the end of the 
season rolls around, we can make a bid into the 
NCAA tournament," Stefankiewicz said. 

On Sunday, the Mastodons faced off against 
Valparaiso and fell to the Crusaders 4-0. The 
team will not play again until Oct. 5, when 
they travel to Indianapolis to compete against 
the IUPUI Jaguars. The game should be a good 
matchup, with a possible slight favor towards 
IPFW. Their common opponent in the IPFW

Hefty Fine not quite 



By Andrew C. Hoover 



We are all in college now. We are all adults, 
in only the most technical of senses. We should 
be more mature ili.ui middle school sluderus, 
right? 

Well, if you sitll laugh at fart jokes and obscure 



i for "vagina," which I do, 

might like the new Bloodhound Gang CD Hefty 
Fine, which goes on sale Sept. 27. 

However, immature jokes aside, if you hate 
music that sucks, well, you will not like Hefty 
Fine. If your music needs to be actually good, 
sorry, Bloodhound Gang IBHGI let you down on 
their fourth album. 

From the first track to the last, every song is 
just a series of fart jokes, crap jokes, and more 
nicknames for sex, penis, and vagina than I can

Remember those kiddy keyboards that

Bloodhound Gang does too and I think they use 
it on a few songs. The vocals have gone back-

could find on their first CD Use your Fingers, 
which was terrible! 

All in all, even the iiiiim h.inkure Ulnndlnimul 
Gang fan will be turned off by the lack ol quality 
on any level that is recorded on Hefty Fine. It is 
not funny, it is not musically good, and it is nut

the drums like it's the easiest

put his whole body into it like 
most drummers do; he sits with 
a static Tace and plays away, 
never missing a beat. 

The Stones closed the set 
with "It's Only Rock n' Roll ", and 
the four remaining members 
gave a bow to the crowd as 
everyone cheered. This is a 
band that helped start rock n' 
roll as we know it today, the 
band that never gives up, the 
band that gave us classic after
