The media was allowed to roam freely throughout the Viet- 
nam theater during that conflict. The problem with what the 
media was revealing was that th " 
and the tactics of the military w 
information was upsetting to the p 
the reality of war is honiiyin^. The battles I 
living rooms of the United States on television every night, and 
eventually these horrors became overwhelming to us. This is 
something the government wants to ensure does not happen 
again. 

The problem is l he restnclums prevent the media from doing 
its job. The purpose of the media is to inform the public. The 
only coverage that is allowed is accessed by press pools. This 
means a group of reporters is taken, by the military, to a 
location of the military's choosing to interview people in the 
presence of mi)itai\ public ivlalmns personnel. Much that may 
be on the tips of the soldiers' tongues will not be said in the 
presence of a PR officer. 

A free-roaming press is essential to accurate and complete 
news gathering. When access is restricted to areas designated 
by the military and media persons are constantly accompanied 
by military public rclahuns oiiieers, the media is stripped of its 
competitiveness, which usually serves as a catalyst to speedy 
and accurate reporting. Afler all, getting the scoop is a media 
person's biggest reward. 

This restricted access also causes suspicion among the mem- 
bers of the press, and probably the people, that they are not 
getting the whole slorv. Tim is nud.iuhiedK line ejven histori-
