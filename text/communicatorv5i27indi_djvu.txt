Steering board provides 
for student power debate 






ByMARKFRANKE 

The long dormant issue of student 
power awakened last Thursday and 
Friday at the meetings of the Ad Hoc 
Joint Steering Committee (AHJSC) 
as members debated the relative 
inputs of student and faculty in the 
university governance system. 

"I feel there should be a greater 
input of students because in the long 
run they will be affected by these 
decisions," said student Paul Green, 
who appeared to be the leading 
spokesman for greater student parti- 

Approximately ten students at- 
tended the Thursday meeting, their 
presence prompted by a rumor that 
the two student members of the 
committee had been voted off the 
committee. The rumor proved to be 
unfounded. 

Green called for student repre- 
sentation in the unification process 
from start to finish. He said that there 
is a "habit of things kind of 
steam-rolling over the student body." 

Dr. James Gilbert, associate 
dean for academic affairs of Purdue 
here and a co-chairman of the 
committee, countered Green's charg- 
es. Gilbert said that the AHJSC was 
essentially a faculty committee. 
charged to report to both of the IU-PU 
faculty senates. 

"This is not a total constituency 
committee," said Gilbert. "The 
faculty decided that 'We would like 



members." 

Gilbert said that one of the 
reasons that students were included 
on the AHJSC was to "keep us (the 
faculty) honest." 

Dr. Andrew Harper, chairman of 
the division of music and a committee 
member, explained the inclusion of 



after I've heard," he said. 

Gilbert emphasized the fact that 
the AHJSC was not a policy making 
committee, but rather an advisory 
body to the faculty senates. He 
suggested that the Student Senate set 
up its own committees to study the 
upcoming merger. 

"If they (students) don't have 
their own committee they 
well be steam-rolled,"

they are being steam-rolled. He cited

administration would be asked to 
serve on these student committees. 

Greg Lewark, student member of 
the AHJSC, moved that the commit- 
tee's name be changed to the Ad Hoc 
Joint Faculty Steering Committee 
(AHJFSC). He said that the new 
name would better describe the 
purpose of the committee, which is to 
advise the faculty senates. The name 
change was accepted. 

Obie Booker criticized the com- 
mittee for its lack of black members. 
He compared the AHJFSC to the 
Chancellor Search and Screen Com- 
mittee, which is also composed of all 
white members. 

"Most people at least protect 
themselves by having one black," 
said Booker. 

Harper defended the committee 
against Booker's charges. "You have 
to give some of us credit for at least 
having an open mind," said Harper. 

Booker pointed out that both the 
AHJFSC and the super-chancellor 
committee have only one woman 
member as well as no blacks. Lone 
AHJFSC woman Gloria Huxoll said 
that she was on the committee via 
election of the dental auxiliary faculty 
and not merely to represent women. 

Booker suggested that the Black

only after a secret ballot vote of 10-5. 
Professional development includes 
teaching load, promotion and tenure, 
research support, sabbatical leave, 
fellowships, travel, and support 

Other task forces include aca- 
demic structure, administrative 
structure, external relationships, uni- 
versity governance, student con- 
cerns, and academic policies. 

Each task force was assigned two 
AHJFSC members Other members 
would be appointed by the individual 
constituency: I.U. faculty, Purdue 
faculty, or students. 

The task forces were charged 
with reporting back to the full 
committee by April 8.

Drop-in child care cenfi f 
now operating at deficit 



*ss 



By TOMMY FRANKE 

The Drop-in child care center on 
campus is operating at a deficit, it 
was announced at last week's meeting 
of the advisory board for the center. 

The budget for the 73-74 school 
year was estimated at $21,000, 
including $18,500 for full-time and 
part-time staff salaries, and $2,500 for 
supplies and expenses. 



this year will exceed $29,000. 

John Ulmer, dean of student 
services, presented these figures to 
representative of the 



board's financial c 

Ulmer noted that there was a 
deficit of $7,820, calculated from 
projected income figures. 

The financial committee recom- 
mended that some changes be made 
in operating procedures in order to

canceling evening care, raising rates

imperative plan where parents would 
work on hour lor every two hours that 
their children were in the center. 

The financial committee recom- 
mended raising all rates, canceling 
evening care, and the cooperative 
plan. 

Nancy Getzin, director of the 
center, commented that the evening 
care hours had proved to be 
unsuccessful because it costs the 
center more in staff pay during those 
hours than what it was receiving in 
users' fees for those hours. 

The advisory board discussed all 



The board was concerned, how- 
ever, that the cooperative plan would 
decrease the quality of the care given 
the children. After much discussion, it 
was decided that the plan was 
necessary and that if parents were 
screened as carefully as regular 
employees the quality of care would

It was suggested by the financial 
committee and agreed upon by the 
board that the rates be raised from 
$.50 an hour to $.75 an hour for the 
first child, and from $.25 an hour to 



$.50 an hour for the second child of 
each family. 

Ulmer will report back to the 
financial committee the board's 
approval of the suggested changes 
and some final decisions will be 
forthcoming. 

It was noted that if rates were 
raised, the new rates would not go into 
effect until the summer.

Senate demands that P.U. 
release Communicator funds 



By BARRY LaBOV 

A resolution calling for the 
immediate release of all Communica- 
tor funds presently impounded by the 
Purdue Business Office passed the 
Student Senate last Wednesday night. 
The vote on the resolution was 

When asked about the Senate's 
action, Senator Charles Pratt respon- 
ded, "We're only beginning. We're not 
going to let anyone get away with 
making asses out of the students." 

The resolution's author, Rollie 
Clements, stated, "This resolution 
gave all Senators a chance to support

The Senate approved four execu-

represents more than the Communi-

Preparation for middle age 



Power failure 



It is interesting to note that Student Body President Brock Able is 
finally making some student appointments to university committees. 

During his campaigns for president, Mr. Able stated thai he wanted 
equal student representation on the numerous committees that deal with 
student concerns and affairs. 

Mr. Able has certainly not succeeded in obtaining greater student 
representation on these committees. In fact, he has failed in appointing 
students to those commiltees which already provide for student 
representation. 

He has hidden behind the excuse that he cannot find students to serve 
in these positions. However, this newspaper is aware of two students who 
volunteered to hold committee memberships. These two students 
appeared at several Student Senate meetings only to find that their 
names had never been placed in nomination. 

This fact makes it obvious that there are students who are interested 
in participating in university governance. 

Student power has been on the decline the last two years. One 
explanation for this decline has to be Mr. Abie's reluctance to take 
advantage of the power that students do have. 

Whether or not this decline can be arrested remains to be seen. 
Hopefully, next year will not be too late.

"Life begins at 4ff" is a slogan 
bandied about by soap opera play- 
wrights, psychologists, Madison Ave- 
nue salesmen and other apostles of 
positive thinking. 

Life often does begin at 40 - for a 
man. As a woman becomes middle- 
aged, however, her opportunities for 
happiness decrease dramatically 
with her major options becoming 
loneliness and penury. 

In a speech given at a conference 
on women and aging held at Ann 
Arbor, Mich., Dr. Pauline Bart (a 
professor of sociology at the Abraham 
Lincoln School of Medicine) pointed 

that "in the age bracket 45-64 



bracket is 1.05 to 1." 

Dr. Bart confirmed what most 
women have long suspected - that the 
male has a much greater chance to 
remarry than the female and that he 
remarries a younger woman. 

The economic picture for the 
mitldli' iiced woman alone is not more 
encouraging According to a survey

By ANTHONY HARRIGAN 

The Gulag Archipelago by Russ- 
ian novelist and civil libertarian 

Alexander Solzhenitsyn is a book that 
will shake the world. 

This is a reasonable conclusion, 
based on reading the first install- 
ments of the history of the prison 
camps that dot the Soviet Union like 

Other former prisoners of the 
communist regime have described 
the nightmare horrors of Soviet 
concentration camps in Siberia and 
the Arctic But The Gulag Archipela- 
go is bound to have a profound effect 
on free people around the world 
because Solzhenilsyn is both a major 
writer, in the tradition of the great 
Russian novelists, and a man of 
heroic courage. 

In publishing this book in the West 
against the wishes of the Soviet 
authorities, Solzhenitsyn exposes 
himself to the terrible wrath and 
retaliation of the men who rule the 
USSR. 

The word "Gulag" in the title of 
the book is the Russian acronym for 

camps" The book tells the story of 
communist oppression and terror in 
the Soviet Union from 1918 to 1956. 
The first installments, which are 
being published in The New York 
Times, describe the cruelties prac- 
ticed against anyone who even 
whispered opposition to the commun- 
ist regime - and against countless 
innocent people who were swepl up in 
the terror campaign without any 
justification whatsoever. 

The Gulag Archipelago is based 
on SolzheniLsyn's own experience in a 



prison camp 




1950s and on 

if the camps, many of them 

physically and psychologically crip- 
pled by the brutalization to which they 
were subjected. 

The publication of The Gulag 
Archipelago is a disaster for the 
Soviet Union inasmuch as it makes 
clear that oppression and terror have 
been features not simply of one short 
era but the entire period of commun- 
ist rule. The image the Soviets have 
been at pains to construct in the outer 
world may be shattered by the 
revelations in The Gulag Archipelago 
Many liberals in the West, who 
refused to believe the reports of 

Soviet regime, are likely to be 
convinced by the power and majesty 
of Solzhenitsyn's writings and the 
manifest courage of his act in 
publishing his explosive account. 

It is ironical that a regime based 
on the concept of mass man, and 
under which the individual counts for 
nothing against the party and the 
state, should discover that a personal 
challenge from one man of courage 
has a global impact that pushes aside 
long years of propaganda. Contrary to 
communist doctrine, the individual is 
a major (actor in history, as the acts 
and words of Solzhenitsyn and other 
brave Russians are proving. 

Perhaps the greatest influence of 
The Gulag Archipelago will be 
internal. For all their controls, the 
Soviet authorities most probably 
won't be able to prevent copies of the 
book being circulated in the USSR 
The manuscript reached the West 
despite Soviet knowledge of its 
existence The process of getting it to 
a Western publisher must have 
involved acts of great bravery by a 
number of Russians. The likelihood is 
that other brave Russians will 
arrange clandestine distribution in 
: USSR by typescript and other 



of the book to the peoples in 
the Soviet territories. 

The principal meaning of The 
Gulag Archipelago is that even the 
most ironclad totalitarian system 
completely extinguish the 



protest that will be heard around the 



burst of machine guns. The tanks 
were rolling by the office windows. 
The secretary closed the curtains and 
the noise subsided. - What was I

Chase Manhattan Bank has stated, to 
generate the $1.35 trillion needed for 
operations from 1970 through 1985, the 
oil companies must increase earnings 
18 per cent a year. 

Yet, according to the Research 
Institute of America, Congress is 
about to "clobber" the major oil 
companies, because their recent 
profit improvements "run against the 
grain." 

Richard Salzmann, director edi- 
tor of the institute, said in an 
interview, "However, these moves by 
Congress should not negatively affect 
capital investments of the oil compa- 
nies. Government will prod firms to 
invest in more production. 

"The government wants them to 
increase capital investment in explo- 
ration, development and refining, and 
cut back on marketing activities 
which lead to manipulation of 

Salzmann said that, through 
playing off domestic and internation- 
al oil, "In their marketing the major 
oil companies have a tendency to 
control prices." Proof is hard to

s clear that the U.S.-based oil 
companies are making major capital 
expenditures both here and abroad. 
Heavier percentages of their 
outlays are for exploration and 
development (as opposed to refining, 
marketing and distribution) and for 
research, such as oil shale develop- 



According to the 
department of McGraw-Hill Publica- 
tions subsidiary of McGraw-Hill, 
planned domestic expenditures by 
domestic companies for 1974 will be 
$14.3 billion, up 38 per cent from last 
year. By contrast, industry in general 
will be up $13.6 billion. 

An additional $7.1 billion will be 
spent by the domestics overseas, for a 
total of $21.4 billion, up 25 per cent 
from 1973. 

Such expenditures have to be 
generated in the main from internal 
earnings; the oil companies are 
limited in what they can generate 
from debt and equity financings. 

Higher profits, In turn, depend on 
higher prices - one reason so many 
economists feel that the price 
mechanism is the only . means of 
rationing fuel. The higher ■ prices 
should be reflected on the books of the 
oil companies, so that they can afford 
further capital expenditures. 

"If the law of supply and demand 
generates bigger profits for the oil 
companies, so be it," said Prof. Ross 
Wilhelm of the University of Michi- 
gan's graduate business school. 
"They need the profits for capital 
expenditures."

GOING JUST A LITTLE TOO FAR 

This year Bill Harrell will do anything 
in the world to win the powerful Ohio Valley 
Conference Basketball crown. He'd prob- 
ably trade his wife and kids in for it. 

Harrell is the coach of the Morehead 
State University basketball squad which is 
in the thick of the battle for the league title 
and a coveted NCAA berth. After years of 
coming close, Harrell feels that this is the 
do-or-die year for the northeastern 
Kentucky school. 

The7000-phis town of Morehead thrives 
on little else but basketball, especially at 
this time of the year. But the usually united 
Kentucky burg has split down the middle 
over the recent controversy spurred by 
Harrell. 

Here's what happened : about two 
weeks ago, Morehead State was scheduled 
to play an away non-conference tilt with 
Illinois State. Before the season had 
started, Harrell had tried to get the contest 
cancelled because it was right in the middle 
of the conference play and would demand 
that the team make an 11-hour sojourn to 
play a relatively unimportant contest. Then 
it would be right back to Kentucky where 
his tired and exhausted charges would have 
to quickly get up for further conference 
games. 

Harrell even offered to pay Illinois 
State a sizable indemnity to cancel the 
unwanted contest. But I.S.U. said no. 

So two weeks ago Harrell made his 
decision with the full consent of his players 
and the resigned consent of the school's 
athletic director: he would keep his 
starting players at home and just send the 
reserves on the journey to take on Illirtois 
State. 

To make this part of the story short, the 
Morehead State reserves were easily blown 
out of the I.S.U. gym by a final tally of 
113-74. But the Illinois A.fa. Milt Weisbeck- 
er was not satisfied.

did Harrell in 
effect throw the game to Illinois State? 
Certainly his lack of consideration for the 
opposition was a great breach pf moral 
ethics in college sports. 

I.S.U. was looking forward to the test 
with Morehead State. And instead of a 
challenging contest, it was just a big waste 
of valuable time and energy. 

Did Harrell ever stop to consider that 
perhaps the laugher with Morehead State 
might have a serious effect on the Illinois 
State squad? Would they be able to "get 
up" for their next opposition after using 
little effort to wipe out Morehead State? 

He could at least have sent his whole 
team to Illinois, and then furnished 
respectable competition for I.S.U. while 
perhaps still giving h"

And what about the several thousand 
Illinois State fans who came to see a good 
game? They paid their money to see their 
team battle a foe for superiority and 
respect (all in good competitive spirit), did 
they not? 

They came to that game ready to 
release their tension, to let it all hang out in 
support of their team. Instead they were 
treated to a farce. They should have 
released their tension on Harrell after the 

After the controversial contest, Harrell 
blubbered, "1 don't care what people say. 
Hell yes I'd do it again. I'd jump up and 
down and yell 'hooray' for the chance." 

Uh-huh. And, dear boy, you might find 
that a few people in the land of Lincoln 
might do a little jumping up and down too if 
you got another chance to do your thing. 

Getting what you want at the expense 
of the other guy. Is this what America is all 
about?
