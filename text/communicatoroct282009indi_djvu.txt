Sociology Awareness Week 

Movie Night with Michael Moores "Sicko" 



By Kristan Mensch 



Sociology Awareness Week began 
Tuesday, October 20ih. In acknowl- 
edgement, the Sociology Club decided 
to hold a screening of Michael Moore's 
movie "Sicko" and have a panel discus- 
sion afterward. 

"Sicko" is Moore's documentary, 
which focused on health care in the 
United Stales compared to countries 
ih.it have national health care cover- 
age; an excellent choice since America 
i*. in [he middle of deciding on a health 
care reform bill. 

With America trying to decide on 
what kind of health care coverage 
would be most efficient and affordable, 
Moore gave the audi- 
ence a glimpse in the 
life of national health 
care. 

Moore began by 
talking to many in- 
dividuals in the U.S. 
who had terrible health problems rang- 
ing from fingers cut off by accident to 
victims or heart attack and cancer. Ev- 
ery one of them had either been turned 
down by their insurance company be- 
cause the procedures they needed were 
considered experimental treatment or 
because they did not cover those pro- 
cedures in their insurance plan. 

"1 always thought health insurance 
companies were there to help us," said 
Moore. 

After talking to Americans. Moore 
went on to Canada, London and France 



"...Moore summed 
everything up perfectly, 
saying that they live in a 
world of 'we/ not 'me'. " 



health care, the doctors that Moore in- 
terviewed had it very well off in France, 
some owning a three-story home with 
a car and flat screen television. 

Moore also brought to the atten- 
tion of the audience a few aspects of 
our country that are socialized, such 
as police, firefighters, teachers and the 
postal service. All of these services are 
there to help us and work out just fine. 
Speaking about other countries. 
Moore summed everything up per- 
fectly, saying that "they live in a world 
of'we.'not'me'." 

One panel participant. Allen Coun- 
ty Health Commissioner, Deborah 
McMahan. M.D., chimed in on that as- 
pect a bit, adding that Americans are 
taught in all cases to want more than 
necessary. Instead 
of owning a house, 
car and television. 
Americans seem to 
want a bigger house, 
multiple cars and 
televisions for every 
main room of the house. McMahan 
suggested that this may take a toll on 
individual health. She also suggested 
that America needs to make a consen- 
sus about what type of health care the 
United States citizens actually want. 

Another panel speaker, Doug Hom- 
er, the host of public access shows "The 
Libertarian Perspective" and "Libertar- 
ians At Large," said "I think sick care is 
what we have." There is no doubt that 
America is not the most healthy coun- 
try out there, and Horner seemed to be- 
lieve that with better health, we would 
not have as much of a problem as we 





to sec how citizens were doing in coun- 
tries with national health care. Many do with health care. "America is fat and 
of them were perfectly content - even lazy and we like it," Horner said, 
laughing at the fact that he asked how Over all, "Sicko" got people to start 
mucbilcoslthemtogotothehospital. thinking about health care, and then 
It seemed throughout this mov- the panel discussion got people talk- 
ie that national health care systems ing. The last step is getting people to

Though people tend to think that doc- that they think would work best for this

Every year 1PFW pub- 
lishes an annual report 
displaying the facts and 
figures regarding the 
number of crimes re- 
ported both on campus 
and in the buildings that 
surround the campus. 

The 2009/2010. annu- 
al report was recently re- 
leased. The report com- 
pares figures detailing 
the years of 2006 to 2008. 

In 2007 there were 
Eetti murders, one rape, 
one aggravated assault, 
1 1 burglaries and a single 
motor, vehicle theft, a 
sum of 14 crimes report- 
led overall. 

During 2008, one 



murder, one aggravated 
assault (non-campus 
building) one rape, 15 
burglaries and one mo- 
tor vehicle theft were 
called in, a sum of 18 
crimes altogether. 

When IPFW, a state 
institution is compared 
to the University of Notre 
Dame a private institu- 
tion, which is an hour 
and a half away and has 
a comparable number 
of students their annual 
report shows an arguably 
grimmer portrait than 
lPFW's. 

There were 42 crimes 
similar to those report- 
ed on the IPFW campus 
in 2007- zero murders, 
three rapes, two aggra- 
vated assaults, 37 bur- 
glaries and five motor 
vehicle thefts. 



As for 2008. Notre 
Dame had zero murders, 
one aggravated assault, 
43 burglaries, two rapes 
and five motor vehicle 
thefts, a grand total of 51 
crimes reported on their 
campus. 

During the years of 
2007 and 2008, there 
were more crimes re- 
ported at Notre Dame 
than IPFW. 

"|IPFW| is probably 
the safest place in city" 
said Larry Clark, dis- 
patcher for the IPFW 
Campus Police, 

According to Chris 
Runschlage an IPFW 
freshmen studying Pub- 
lic Affairs and Criminal 
lustice. "1 feel that IPFW 
is pretty safe campus, if i 
had to. I'd rank it 10 out 
oflO."

Organizing for America Hayhurst talks education, jobs, 

health care, and Middle East 



By Devin Middleton 

4*vinpn$90yaNoQ com 



Keeping people fired up for politics 
has not always been easy. Theres no 
exception in the case of Organizing 
for America. When it went under the 
tide of Organizing for Obama last, 
the nation was fired up to their fullest 
for one of the biggest elections of our 
time. The number of volunteers have 
gone down, but they arc not letting up 




anytime soon. 

I recently spoke with Organizing for 
America representative. Adam Beckett 
While he tells me that he wants to get 
the number of supporters back to the 
millions it used to have, he assures 
me that they are still something to be 
reckonned with. He also had a lot of 
great things to say about Fort Wayne. 
When i asked him if things were slowing 
down in this area, he told me thai Fort 
Wayne has showed the most growth 
in the past 6 weeks. He went on to say 
that in the past 3 weeks, many more 
volunteers have stepped up to help. 

October 20th was their National Day 
of Action. On that day, they had about 
330,000 people making phone calls. 
Indiana was ranked 5th in the country 
on that day. These phone calls do not 
Just spark the flame inside the people's 
will to help, it is also their strategy 
against all of the myths and misleading 
information that has plagued Obama's 
healthcare plan. He told me that their 
strategy was to come ready with as 
much information as possible, and 
work from the ground up to educate 
people as best they can. 

Theirgoals are only to continue what 
they've been doing best : educating 
America and getting more and more 
supporters to get back to the numbers 
they had last year. With the persistence 
they are showing, this could definitely 
become a reality.

room 101. 

"Pictures of Things 
That Aren't There" is a 
collection of six separate 
works that deal with 
Daniel's experience of 
being the care taker for 
her mother, who suffered 
from Alzheimer's 

disease. Mary Daniel is 
a limited term lecturer 
in the Communication 
Department and has 
a M.EA in film and

Daniel has had a lengthy 
career of working 
with experimental, 

documentary and 

independent films. 

A subsequent event 
that LPH will be hosting 
is a fundraiser called No 
Shave November, "We 
are encouraging students 
to not shave during the 
month of November and 
take pledges for how long 
they can go" said Dirrim. 
This fundraiser will be 
open to both men and 
women; there will be 
even be a few celebrity 
faculty members taking 
pan in the fundraiser, 
whose identities are still 
top secret, she said.

tionally Conservative area, though the 
tide may be changing in the next elec- 
tion cycle. 

In a recent interview, Hayhurst dis- 
cussed key issues affecting students, 
northeast Indiana, and the country as 
a whole. 

In regards to students, a big issue to- 
day is paying for education. Recently, 
the Sludent Aid and Fiscal Responsibil- 
ity Act was passed, which will expand 
federal Pell grants and end the practice 
of federally subsidized private loans. 

"To have a decent job, you need ad- 
vanced education," said Hayhurst. "I 
think that having a good flow and avail- 
ability of loans is very important." 

An issue Hayhurst believes is af- 
fecting northeast Indiana is the lack 
of job growth, especially over the past 
fifteen years. Hayhurst thinks the best 
way to improve job growth is to rethink 
foreign trade policy by focusing more 



hurst suggested expanding Medicare 
coverage to those who are 55 and older, 
offering a public option and to give free 
I u', il 1 1 1 clinics a boost, putting excessive 
bonuses of health insurance compa- 
nies under control. 

Hayhurst was also eager to talk 
about policy in the Middle East. "We 
need to think of what's going on glob- 
ally." Hayhurst said, "I think it's good 
to review our goals and the war in Af- 
ghanistan and how that helps us reach 
our goal of protecting the citizens of 
the U.S." 

Having been around during the 
Vietnam era, Hayhurst stated that 
whatever happens in the Afghanistan 
situation, the world should be able lo 
have to look back and deem that Amer- 
icans were successful. 

"I've thought a lot about where the 
country is headed," Hayhurst said, 
"We need to... make this country work 
in a manner that supports working 
families. The American middle class is 
steadily shrinking." 

The Indiana primary election will 
take place on May 10, 2010 and the 
general election will take place on Nov. 
2,2010.

OPINION 



P. 5 




"After a bad break up, why do girls seem 
like the only ones affected while guys act 
like nothing happened?" 



GW: Thai is an assumption thai I 
definitely do not endorse. This state- 
men I is more of an opinion rather 
limn fact. After a break up gone bad, 
the two parties do not usually see 
eye-la- eye, nor do they know one 
another's true feelings because "I all 
the lighting and hateful words. It is a 
source thai females tend to be more 
emotional and open about I heir feel- 
ings. Males, in the other hand, hide 
theft emotions as much as possible 
while remaining cool and collected 
in the presence of others. Especially 
if the girl was the one to end things, 
he does not want to be emasculated 
an) more by telling his friends how 
much he misses you; he will prob- 
ably be more likely to put you down 
in that situation. You never know, he 
could be listening to Toni Braxton's 
'lln-bicak My Heart" and crying to 
his mom. Remember, men do have 
feelings; they just repress them more 
than women do. 

Guy: When people break up. they 
handle their pain in different ways. 
While men and women both play 



the "It docs not bother mr" panic, 
men usually rely on this tactic more. 
Men are very prideful, they hate to 
lose. Letting that pain show is admit- 
ting that they're not invincible. Few 
people can be completely confident 
all the time, but many people can 
put on a front like they're confident 
all the time. A lot of the time, they arc 
really hurting but just do not want to 
show it. Thais the good explanation. 
The cruel explanation is that maybe 
they [usl really did not care about the 
relationship. 

lis a hard chunk of reality to swal- 
low, hut it's still reality. Consider this, 
if you gave time, attention, and con- 
cern to that relationship and he did 
not, then whose the one missing out? 
He obviously did not deserve to be in 
a relationship if he was not going to 
work to keep it together. 

Do not let them fool you like you 
are the one missing something, be- 
cause he is only trying to feel comfort 
in the fact that he will never be able to 
have a relationship or anything more 
in life because he is too lazy to work 
to keep anything together. I think you 
should probably be the one walking 
around like it does not affect you, not 
him.

"Everyone has had a time when they were toid that

explained the irony of how, when he was in high school, 
he wasn't a very good student and teachers commonly 
discouraged him from a life of playing rock and roll. But 
now here he is years later with a PhD. having written sev- 
eral books and is told that his one of the top scholars in 
his field. Minton is the perfect example of someone has

Minton is one of the five members of the band, 
affectionately named The Possum Trot Orchestra, 
"The term for it now is Americana; it's a mix of 
American roots music, elements of bluegrass. 
some county, some folk, elements of blues, 
jazz and reggae we try to bring swing into it 
and of course rock" he said, describing the 
genre of music Uiat they play. 

The band got its name because almost ev-

of like Shelbyville and Springfield, and the 
idea of being an orchestra from Possum Trot 
amused Minton. 

Alongside fellow band member Susie Sura-

of the original material, about half my songs, 
half her songs" he said. 

The band is composed completely of indi-

A world without elephants The Health Food

By Kelly Mdendon 



More than TOO elephants are 
slaughtered every oay by poach-

years if the {tlr-gal ivory trade 
keeps going strung. This is a sharp 
change from ten years ago, when 
there were more than 1.2 million 
African elephants. 

"The illegal trade in ani- 
mals throughout the world is 
valued at $20.5 billion annually,'' 
according to "Tree Hugger." Thai 
type of profit makes the ivory 
trade an extremely profitable in- 
dustry, and nne that poachers are

There is supposed to be a 
ban on international ivory trade in

tended. 

After the ban, "ivory prices 
plummeted and so too did the in- 
centives to kill elephants," IFAW's 
Southern Africa director Jason 
liell-Lcask wrote in an opinion ar- 
ticle in South Africa's .Sunday Inde- 
pendent this month," according to 
Earth Times. 

A total international ban was 
set in place in 1 989 under the Con- 
vention on International Trade in 
lindungered Species or CITES con- 
ference. 




"CITES is an international ac- 
cord signed by 130 member coun- 
tries that prohibits trade in endan- 
gered species listed on Appendix

according to Hie African Wildlife 
Foundation.

China, has reached record levels." 

Because die ivory Is "re-

value is increased, causing 
people lo want it even more.

Along with the food on the salad bar, there is a

The Health Food Shoppe offers many anti-

komhucha, Synergy, and High County Drinks. 
They also have coffee, tea and hot chocolate avail-

During my visit, as I looked over the salad bar 
another customer told me, "It's all good!" I had the 
chicken and vegetable soup, a chicken cacsar wrap, 
and a blueberry Bossa Nova. The soup was deli- 
cious and the chicken caeswwar wrap tasted fresh

Although the to-go Styrofoam boxes and soup 
containers are recyclable, there is no recycle bin 
available by the salad bar just a trash can. The 
only silver wear they provide are disposable plas-

be more cost effective for them as well as better for 
the environment. 

Although the food was a little expensive, my 
bill totaled to $13.07, 1 would go to the Heath Food

Dons Win Three Out of Three 



By Oliver Kook

Last weekend was a 
very successful weekend 
for the women's vol- 
leyball learn from IPFW. 
Hosting games on Fri- 
day, Saturday, and Sun- 
day, an exhausting but 
promising weekend con- 
cluded al Hillard Gates 
Sports Center. The Dons 
started out Friday night 
with a clean 3-0 sweep 
over Centenary. Led by 
an outstanding perfor- 
mance with a match high 
of 17 kills from junior 
outside hitter Mayara 
Schlindwein, the team 
kept the ongoing win- 
ning streak of now eight 
straight wins over the 
Centenary Ladies alive. 

The conference 

match on Saturday night 
against Oral Roberts had 
great importance for the 
IPFW squad since the 
Golden Eagles were ty- 
ing for third place in the 
Summit League, Alter 
losing the first set by only 
two poinls. the Dons 
faugh! back in game two, 
tying the match for the 
first time- Game three 
got out of hand as (he 
Golden Eagles increased 
the pressure on the 
Dons with good serves 
and many digs in their 
own back court defense. 
But the Dons came back 
again with a great team 
effort in game four win- 
ning 25-14. demonstrat- 
ing the guests that the 



match was not meant 
to be over yet. Keeping 
the lead alive for the 
rest of the set, Ihe IPFW 
women s volleyball team 
sealed another impor- 
tant victory for the sole 
possession of the third 
rank in the conference. 

On Sunday afternoon, 
Missouri Slate came to 
the Hillard Gates Sports 
Center for the second 
meeting of the season. 
Having received votes 
in the latest American 
Volleyball Coaches As- 
sociation (AVCA) poll, 
Missouri State definite- 
ly counts as one of the 
stronger teams to have 
come to Fort Wayne this 
season lo play IPFW. 
With already eight games 
played over the week- 
end, the women's vol- 
leyball team had to bring 
another impressive per- 
formance to resist the 
strong offense from Mis- 
souri State. Arguably, the 
Dons showed one of the 
best performances of 
the season in the five set 
heartbreakcr against the 
Bears. Senior Hebekah 
Roehm led the Dons with 
20 kills, while junior out- 
side hitter Mayara Sch- 
lindwein stepped up her 
game one more time, 
adding 17. Responsible 
for the great offensive 
plays from the Dons was 
certainly the career high 
ol "lit ,t--Ki&gt; ifniii fresh- 
men setter Megan Steen- 
huysen. who distributed 
the ball to her attackers 



in an outstanding fash- 
As Ihe season contin- 
ues, the IPFW women's 
volleyball team pulls 
closer togeiher, showing 
great effort and the right 
attitude to win competi- 
tive matches. Peaking 
towards the end of the 
season, many players 
lhat started the season 
with little or no collegiate 
playtime seem to nave 
taken great advantage 
of their chance to im- 
prove their game. Junior 
outside hitter Stephanie 
Lamberti plays the best 



season in her career, 
sophomore Alii Honk led 
her learn in blocks sever- 
al times this season and 
players like freshmen 
Tessa McGill get more 
time on the court to help 
out the Dons with great 
plays in the back court 
defense around senior 
libera Jamie Schwartz. 
This interesting depth of 
players might be an im- 
portant key to succeed 
in this year's conference 
as the lady Dons get one 
step closer to the par- 
ticipation m the Summit 
League tournament.
