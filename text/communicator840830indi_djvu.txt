New vendor

ByANGELAFRANCB

Fried chicken If those words bring rumblings of protest from the stomachs of 
students reluming to IPFW this year Ihey can put their tummies at ease.

Fort, and which also stocks the vending machines, is expected to lure more

"We'll still serve tried chicken, of course." Food Service Director Marybeth 
Hughes said, "but it won't beon the menuevery single day." 

Hughes, who works for the new food service. Servomalion. is optimistic about 
both Ihe quality and variety ol the new menu selections.

from dell plates of corned beef, roasl beef, ham or turkey sandwiches (complete 
with pickle spear), lo three varieties of nachot are on lap. Frequently, specials 
such as this month's "early bird breakfast specials" will be offered. 

The change in food services came about during the summer, when nine vendors 
expressed interest in taking over ARA's expired contract with IPFW For the past 
four yean, ARA food service had been providing the campus with cafeteria, 
catering and vending services. For the extra effort made by ARA to provide 
service during last year's flood, and because of the toss of business resulting from 
that disaster, IPFW granted ARA an extra year's contract In addition lo the 
standard Ihree-year contract 

ARA and Scrvomatlon were among the five vendors who actually returned 
proposals lo Mark English, director of purchasing and general services. English 
scruliniied each of the proposals, which he fell were all very similar, and finally 
decided upon Servo ma lion's, which contained the mosl optimistic sales projec- 
tions of the five. While the other potential suppliers were predicting a downward 
trend In business this year, Servomalion's proposal provided, according to

IPFW operating 
with $23 million 

ByMICHELESHAFFER 

Boards of Trustees from both Indiana University and Purdue University ap- 
proveda 123 million 19M-BS general budget for IPFW last May. 

"The Income side Is suite driven." said John R. Camoghi, vice chancellor of 
financial affairs. Since IPFW Is o state supported university, 65 percent of the 
Income, about 115 million, comes from the slate of Indiana. Student fees contribute 
30 percent of the Income. The remaining S percent comes from miscellaneous

Carnaghi said that deciding an the amount of a budget Is 
process In which Ihe needs of every single department at IPFW has to be con- 
sidered. The department heads have to turn tbelr needs inlo the denn, who reviews 
these requests, places them In priority order and gives them lo the chancellor. 

Eventually, considering the available money, the chancellor decides how much 
money each deportment gels, after placing their requests in a final priority order. 

Some of the less Important requests arc filtered out Carnaghi said. Abo, in 
dividing up the money, the chancellor has to consider what areas or departments 
arc using less money and freeing up funds. In those cases, the extra money is 
added to another deparlmenl's budget lhal needs more money. 

Further down the line, the Stale Appropriations Committee funds the respective 
slate universities after rcveiwing their requests. "They fund each one on its own 
merits." Carnaghi said The money that committee allows for such things as 
salary Increases and utility increases, however, Is much the some for all the slate 
universities.

The copy center next door to Follelt's bookstore In the basement of Kettler Is an 
example of such an oprallon. The copy center, typical of an auxiliary enterprise, 
docs business only with theunivenlty. II does not serve the general public. 

Another example of an auxiliary enterprise at IPFW is the campus trans-

Changes certain 



Speculations are being made right now 
as lo what will happen at TPFW Sept. 4 
when Chancellor Joseph P. Giusti begins 
his leave of absence. 

Giusti has been chancellor here (or the 
past five years. During those five years, 
IPFW has added two new buildings, 
started a library endowment fund, 
added two new bachelor degree 
programs and strengthened its athletic 
programs. Some of these programs were 
starled before Giusli r 



; each of slitulion 



With his departure, change is now 
Inevitable. Time will show what changes 
will occur. Some of Ihc changes may 
benefit the students, others may not. It 
will depend on the priorilies of the 
campus leaders. 

During Giusti's absence, we urge each 
of the student leaders, both in and out of 
students' government, (o pull together 
and lobby the IPFW administration for 
those things which will benefit students 
and make IPFW a better teaming in- 



Parking increased 



Parking again seems to be a problem 
at IPFW. So what else is new? 

This semester, parking shouldn't be 
the problem it was last semester, unless 
enrollment has increased dramatically 
from last (all. 

IPFW had a new lot installed over the 
summer, yet about 100 cars were parked 
illegally on the first day of the semester. 

IPFW is a beautiful campus, though it 



doesn't have the charm of some of the 
nation's older campuses. It is indeed a 
commuter campus and the ad- 
ministration has attempted to meet the 
needs of the commuter, without paving 
the entire campus. 

II students reel the problem still exists, 
they should voice their opinions through 
students' government, not through 
parking illegally.

I remember listening to 
MTV constantly two and 
three years ago. because It 
was different than the 
conservative radio of Fort 
Wayne. When I listen to MTV 
today, it's Just like tuning In 
to the radiD. MTV la gearing 
itself more and more to the 



thing that 

changed is the Music News. 
MTV still has the Insightful 
news that you get nowhere
