s s&gt;-n„njTnous w.th 
)Li aware (hal if you 
receive a packing lickcl on campus, vou will be fined five 
limes Ihe amouni you would befint'd anywhere else in Ihc 
[ily7 Did you know Ihal Ihe parking melers at IPFVV cosl 



sage Ihat we will nol be taken advanlage of 

I'd also like lo know why Ihc professors find it nea?s- 
iary lo change the text o( a course nearly everv other year 
' " ■ Ihe "lalesl addition." Are you telling me that 
1 profound discoveries in the field of analo- 



IPFVV find it necessary lo continually fleece ils students? 

And don't even get me started on Ihe Follell's 
Bookstore with its price gouging scheme. 1 recently visited 
several websites lo find the besi price on a particular text- 
book. The book in question was "Mathematics For 
ElemcntaryTeachers, A Conceptual Approach," Nalurally, I 
slartcd my query at eloUetl.corn whicn listed the book at 
S103 new and S?3 used. 

Next I visited lexlbookx.com and found Ihe price lo be 
S8IBanewandS65.17uscd. 

Finally, the third website I visited was half.com which 
had a listing of "like new" for S5B50, 1 encourage every stu- 
dent lo research textbook prices on Ihe web. Let's send 



about Of is this simply a way ol forcing Ihe student to spend 
an additional S30 for a new text? 

After all. the school does receive 2 1 percent of the pro- 
ceeds from each book sold (13 percent back lo the bookstore 
and eight percent to the school.) 

Remember students, you are the ones who pay the 
salaries of Ihe professors and administrators here at IPFW, 
They have a vested interested in keeping you happy. 
Complain loud and complain often. Sooner or later, some- 

Sincercly.

From the 
Right

Fashion, abortion and sex 

Good'hye 'from the right' 

1 am oilen asked Ihe question. "What are your lop 10 morals, and why?" 
Good question, but although 1 have many moral standards that I alwa&gt;-s 

attempt lo hold lo, il is probably impowible lo select a lop 10, and I could 

iwrile an entire book on why 1 hold lo my moral slarKlaids, but Ihavcrmly my 

little weekly column in Ihis IPFW Cbmmuniailor. 

Due to my extremely limiled ^ce and my uncanny ability of strongly 

disliking typing, I'D jusl keep this short, limiting my moral discussions In^y 

As much as 1 like modem culture and cun-ent fashion trmds, I have lo 
say Ihat modesty is still a trail that is very attractive. If s too often Ihal we're 
pulled iniD thinking that ifs perfectly normal for a lady lo wear loiv-cut jeans. 
3 high-nst Ihong and a barely-thete shirt. 

Skirvlighl shirts were unheard ol |usl a lew years ago. while today no 
lady's wardrobe can be complele vvilhout a full line of shirts lo show off every 
curve ol her breasts. 

Ladies do not under- 
stand what such seductive 
clothes do lo a man. A 
man is sight-onenled and 
sexually aroused by visual 
stimulation, such as a 
short skirt or a Ughl shirt 
By wearing such clothes, 
you are causing men lo 
undress you in Iheir 
rrunds. 'tou are as good as 
naked lo rrunv. and 1 greatly prefer to leave my lady's body a wild mystery — 
unknown and a great pievenlabve lo lust. 

Another moral code thai I believe strongly in is thai human life is 
extraorduunly preaous, I think that Hollywood is partly to blame for the 
doivngrading of human life. Movies routinely portray murders and thai ifs 
okay lo kill it the need arises. 

TTie trends after the infamous Roe v. Wade decision were horrifying, the 
number ol Americans who beLeve in aborton growing steadily until about 10 

Sars ago, and some studies have indicated an increasing number of people 
lieving that abortion is murder. 

Life is precious, and should never be taken God gave you Ihe life you 
have, and only He rriay lake life from you in His timing II should never be 
one person's choice I o terminate anotl^r's life, whether thai lite isoided at the 
end of a loaded shotgun or in at the hand of an aborbonist. 

Human life is nol like ihat of arumals. Humans actually have feelings, 
develop lifelong rcLilionships tvith other humar\s and search lor somelhing lo 
fill the voids and empty holes in Iheir live. Humans an? created in the image 
of God, a spiritual being oealed to worship our creator. 

Perhaps most alarmingly, 1 have been appalled al Ihe current rate of sex- 
ual activity. Hollywood glorihs sex. lis silcoms attempting lo shoiv that sex 
itself is tunny, all while families are failing, sexual perversion is on a rise arul 
STDs are commonplace. 

Humans were created to enjoy sex lothe fullest in the insblutionol mar- 
riage and only in marriage. Sexual relabons oulside of a marriage covenanl 
breed disb\isl and dislo^t&gt;', unhappmess and discontoil. 

Sex is more than a guy getting some and seeing some action. It is more 
Ihana lady lirully feeling accepted It is Ittfspirihiar soulful and physical 
bond between a n^an and woman. It is nol a step that should be entered into 
lightly or for kicks. 

Sex is resen'cd lor marriage, and any sexual relations oulside the con- 
fines o( marriage are wrung. 

These are just a few of the morals 1 believe in and alwaj'S try to stand 
strong believing. You don't have to agree, and you don't have lo disagree, but 
I'm happy that you've read my cnlunm. 

For those ol you who are reading your first issue ol The Cinnmunkalar 
and to Ihe seasoned velerar\s, I challenge you lo never lower the morals you 
hold, lo reexamine the morals you do believe in and to hei^len your morals 
where needed. 

God will forgive you oi amlhing you've ever done lo compromise the 
morals He has set forth. You only need to ask for that forgiveness, and Ihen 
live life lo the ultimate en]oymenl. 



Rituals of passing 



By Dawn Early, Managing Edilc 



By r 



aw, some would s 
■s from pre-school li 



22 years. 

Now on the verge of yet another graduation, thoughts ol starting again 
are only slighlly subdued by thoughts of finally getting out. 

Learning lo count to 100 and wnle in cuisive. spelling bees, science fairs, 
ball games and lunch lines are inlermixed betivecn rituals of passing. 

It wasn't thai long ago. four years to be precise, Ihal I was wearing a white 
cap and pressed goivn. One of the mosl momenlous days of my entire life was 
characterized by strong winds and tornado watches, combined with the laugh- 
ter of family and friends. 

Pride filled both my grandmother and me as 1 slood al Ihat podium, 
addressing the entire audilorium. f allempled lo summarize the previous 13 
years and all of Ihe ups and downs in less than five mmules of discourse. 1 felt 
mature and accomplished, ycl ready to tackle Ihe challenges of college life. 

Four years prior lo that, 1 was a p imp le-and -brace-laced 14-year-old 
awaJling a small slip of paper which would push me on into high school— the 
mosl prized possession of all of my friends. Completion o( junior high was tnv- 
ializpd by the immense glorification of becoming a "high-schooler ' 

Only hvD years had passed since I sal in an elementary audilorium antic- 
ipaling my passmg into junior high, where all the older and cooler kids await- 
ed. For Ihe lasl time we sang songs as an entire class and received awards for 
Ihings such as science projects and perfect attendance. 

11 had been six long years since Ihe ritual had been performed. 
Kindergarten seemed so far back, before boyfriends, before lesls and before 
detentions. 

II was then Ihat I could still remember my hrst graduation of all lime. TTie 
one from pre-school. It was there Ihat 1 wore a si/e6X sundress and a paper cap 
while I carried my favorile Cabbage Patch doll doivn the aisle. It was Ihen that 
1 was five, and years away from SATs and dales. It is now that a whole new

Department of English continues to expand for new semester 



By leniiifei Hunllc)'. Reporlei 

The dcparlmtnl of English 
.ind Linguislics is conlinually 
updating lis curriculum lo meet 
sludenl needs. As sociely 
changes, di lie rent course o(f Br- 
ings and programs are being 
imp tern en led lo remain curronl. 

The department Li develop- 
ing a new program for certifica- 
tion (cir teaching EngRsh as a sec- 
ond language (TESOL). The 
TESOL program will consisl of 
15 credits, one grammar class, 
two methods classes, one class 



on language acquisition and a 
praclicum that will offer class- 
room experience in the student's 
area of interest. 

Advanced expository writ- 
ing a entering the industrial age 
with Stuart Blvlhe's class, 
"Wriling m Ihe bigilal Age." 
According lo Blythe, the class 
focuses on the technological 
tools that an.' now available for 
distributing writing. 

The Lntemel and other elec- 
tronic media have changed the 
meaning of literacy For cen- 
turies, habits have been based on 



the pnnted page, but changes in 
the last 10 lo 15 years have 
opened new options for print. 
The class will explore how the 
rules for pulting together a paper 
cliange when it is being posted 
on the web instead o! in more 
traditional formats. According to 
Blythe. this class has evolved 
from "Literacy in the 
Technological Age," a class he 
taught last year. 

The area of children's lilera- 
lure IS expanding as schools 
emphasize literacy and acknowl- 
edge Ihe need lor students to 



read literature from many cul' 
lures. Lewis Roberts, previously 
in charge of Ihe children's litera- 
ture course at lUB, is joining 
IPFW's English faculty this year. 

In Ihe tall, Roberts will offer 
courses in children's literature 
and in literature for young 
adults- He takes a hands-on 
approach, which will include a 
picture book project and evalua- 
tion of books for inclusion in a 
school library. 

The National Writing 
Project will arrive this summer 
as Kathenne Freclar^d, a special- 



ist in composition pedagogy, 
works in developing the 
Northeasi Indiana Writing 
Program Site, part of a national 
program. 

This program will offer 
workshops for practicing teach- 
ers and will provide ongoing 

'The department of English and 
Lmguistics and the School of 
Education will host the first four- 
week institute opemtcd solely by 
IPFW in the summer of 2003," 
Richard Ramsey said. 

In addition to classes, the 



English department sponsors the 
Visiting Writer's Series which 
brings nationally known authors 
and poets onlQ campus. These 
aulhore teach workshops, visit 
classes and give readings. 

The English department 
also hosts Ihe Sludenl-Faculty 
Reading Series, which allows 
campus writers to share their 
work. Confluence, Ihe student 
literary magazine, is another 
way for students lo share their 
work. T&gt;ie spring 2002 issue is

Honors Program: An overview 



By lenniter Huntley, Reporter 

The Honors Program has 
enperienced a lot of growth 
and development over Ihe 

Kst six years. According lo 
rector Matthew Kubik. the 
growth of the Honors Program 
has created some wonderful 
opportunities for students. 

By offering honors cours- 
es that also fulfill IPFW gener- 
al education requirements, 
students may now obtain the 
Honors Certificate without 
taking any courses outside of 
their degree requirements. 

Course offerings have 
been expanded with the sup- 
port of the vice chancellor of 
Academic Affairs. Several fac- 
ulty have received curriculum 
t rants lo design General 
ducation Area Vl, Advanced 
Study honors classes. Foreign 
travel opportunilics can also 
be used to meet Honors 
Program requirements. 

Students gel more indi- 
vidualized altention from pro- 
fessors and are able to pursue 
personal interests with H- 
options and a more coordinat- 
ed honors project experience. 
This also gives students the 
opportunity to create a part- 
nership in learning wilh a fac- 
ulty mentor. Students are 
encouraged lo explore differ- 
enl aspects of a problem and 



take a more m-deplh look at 
information. 

The Honors program 
strives to bridge the gap 
between disciplines. Many 
honors classes are interdisci- 
plinary. Professor Peter 
Hamburger's calculus class is 
one such example. Mentors 
from many disciplines team 
with his shidents for their cal- 
culus projects. Hamburger 
won a teaching award for his 
outstanding work in this class. 
The National Science 
Foundation and Mathematics 
Throughout the Curriculum 
support his efforts. 

Events and activities 
sponsored by the Honors 
Program provide an opportu- 
nity for students and faculty to 
join in discussions as equals. 
Many of these ate also inter- 
disciplinary. Each semester, 
the department of theater 
invites honors students and 
faculty to attend a dress 
rehearsal and discuss the per- 
formance with the director 
and cast aflerwards. The 
Honors Program also sponsors 
museum trips and cultural 
events as well as less formal 
les and recep- 



Many honors facult}' and 
dcnis have been nahonally 
i or inlemationally recog- 
ed. During the 2001 



National Collegiate Honors 
Convention, IPFW had numer- 
ous presentations by students 
and faculty, more than from 
many of Ihe other schools 
from across the country. IPFW 
had four student and six fac- 
ulty presentations. Kubik has 
made three national presenla- 
tiot\s as a represenlabve of the 
IPRV Honors Program. Heidi 
Saliba worked with a visiting 
professor from South Africa on 
an H-ophon. They presented 
their research at convenBoris in 
PiHsburgii, Egypt and Germany. 

1l\e establishment of the 
Honors Center has made a 
dedicated space for honors 
faculty and students. The 
room, located in Keltlcr Hall 
Room G35. was designed as a 
collaborative effort between 
honors student Melissa King 
and Kubik. It was recognized 
at the NCHC convention. 

These developments in 
the Honors Program have 
occurred within the last six 
years Kubik says that he 
could nol have accomplished 
so much wilhoul Ihe support 
of the Honors Program 
Council, especially thi 



of honors faculty and mentors 
have also made the growth 
and progress possible.

race's ninth year of existence. 
Always interested in promoting 
his band and Purdue. Emrick 
welcomed the chance lo be asso- 
ciated with Ihe young race that 
was quic)(ly establishing an 
mtemaliona! reputation. At that 
time, the band was a milit:ir)' 
unit of men enrolled in Reserve 
OfficerTVaining Corps at Purdue, 

Marcus Gilbert, a 1925 
graduate who lives in Carmel, 
ind.. has fond memories of Ihe 
Indianapolis 500 parade. 

"We played for the 
Indianapolis 5O0 every year." 
Gilbert says. "We'd ride down on 
the Monon railroad or buses the 
day before, and Ihe boys would 
get lo see the town. The Purdue 
Band always leads the parade." 

The parade Gilbert refers lo 
IS the Parade of Bands thai 
begins at B a.m. at the track on 
race day. Each year Purdue 
invites bands across the 
Midwest lo parlicipate in the 
event, which is dominated by 
high school musicians. This year 
17 bands will participate. The 
greater Lafayelte area will be 
represented by the Pride of Tri- 
County Marching Cavaliers. The 
Speedway High School "500" 
Marching Band will represent 
central Indiana. 

Folloiving a tradition begun 




PhDio courlosy of HVrtv. pun/us.. 



83 years ago. only the Puniue 
band plays for Ihe opemng cere- 
monies. It will back up the West 
Point Glee Club in the National 
Anthem. As in years past, the 
band will perform "Anierica the 
Beaulifuf" with Florence 
Henderson and "Back Home Again 
in Indiana" v/ith Jim Nabois. 

Tlie 500 Feslival Parade was

An alarming trend is sweeping 
the nation. For lack of a belter term, it 
is obesity. 1 recently logged on lo my 
AOL account and 1 laughed al what I 
saw. Well, it really wasn't all that 
hmny, but 1 couldn t help it. 

AOL listed the lop 10 fattest dhes 
in the United States. Rest assured. Fort 
Wayne did not make the lisl. Our socie- 
ty is gradually slipping into some very 
unhealthy habits. 

Even if you don't have those 
noticeable extra pounds, almost evet\- 
one has someltiing they wish they could 
improve upon. Lefs face it' a slender 
body is not always a good indicator of 
fitness. Many of us can't jog a mile 
wilhoul getting winded. W e 

all have our eicuses as to why we 
don't cat right or cierclse. I have some 
of the solutions lo those excuses. Over 
the upcoming 






.such a 



Whe"!! 



and how they relate to a 
healthy lifestyle. 

Praper diet accounts tor a large 

i&gt;ntage of the fitness equation. 

■&gt;- goal IS to lose weight, 

lone up or lo pack on big muscles, 
each requires a different approach. 
Some balanced diels should mclude 
supplementation, however, there has 
been much debate about the use of 
supplementation. 

Supplementation range from 
vilamms to performance enhancers. 
Many make claims that they caruiol 
support, wlule others are necessary 
componenb of a healthy diet. They can 
be quite helpful, as more and more peo- 
ple get busier and busier. Certain ones 
lEplace entire meals wtule on the go. 

Why tear yourself doivn physi- 
cally every day exercising if you short- 
change the amount of quality sleep 
you get every night? This defeats the 

Kurpose of trymg to get in shape. Just 
;cause you run a mile or hit the 
weights for an hour doesn't end your 



coirunitment lo \uur bodv and mind 

Suitable rest liki^wist' mcludi^ rest 
in behveen exercises. In the world of 
more is better, the same isn't true for 
exercising. Overtraining can be just as 
coimlerproductive as not eating or 
sleeping adequately. 

Nearly all types of exercise or 
training can be classified into five 
main groups: aerobic, anaerobic, 
machine, body iveight and free weight 
exercises. Remember, you must 
always warm-up procedures. During 
fall, semester. I will explore and 
explain the benefits of each type of 
exercise and warm-up procedures. 
Each individual movement calls for 
precise techiuques to ensure the maxi- 
mum t&gt;enefit is acquired and risk of 
injury is not incurrwJ. 

Also. 1 will go into the recom- 
mended frequency, duration and 
intensity of all the different varieties 
with respect to the specific 
objechvefs). The key is not to thmV. of 
exercise as exercise. Do somethmgyou 
enjoy and you will be more apt to con- 
tmue the activity over the long run. 

A few benefits of a heallhier 
lifestyle include an enhanced self- 
esteem and confidence; increased 

reduced illness and cultivation of an 
all-around feeling of well-being. 

I will also be covering a variety of 
topics related to exercise and health in 
a multitude of platforms. 

One of the most important things 
for people to realize is that there is no 
magic pill or all-inclusive movement 
that will get you what you want. Hard 
work, dedication and time produce 
results. 

If you have any topics or issues 
you would like lo see addressed in 
this column, or if you have any ques- 
hons related to fitness and exercise, 
please send these to The Camm\m\c(k\or.

DI DETERMINATION 

Progress key in recapping IPFW's first year ofDI competition 

By Kathy Delagrange, Edilor championships for eight vears. 

However. IPFW proleslea and 



The pas! year has brought 
many changers to the altiletic 
department, namely Ihe change 
to Division I compebtion. Foimsly 
Kvision D, numerous changes 
woe made in order to comply with 
Dl rules arwl legulations. 

As IPFWs first vear o( 
Oi vision I competition draws to 
a close. Athletic Director Mark 
Pope is pleased with the 
progress made by the depari- 
moit. the coaches and the players. 

"Progress is 
Ihe key ivord 
here. I think we 
all learned a great 
deal this year, 
from athletes to 
coaches to slaif," 
Pope said, "V* 
competed well. 
For most of Ihe 
games, the 
were close 
alt came down to 
the last ten min- 
utes, or the last 
ir the lost 
innings 
where the games 
actually 
decided. Our 
overall record 
may not be the 
best, but I think 

forth a good 

for our first year" 

Compliance ivith Dl niles 
and regulations was a challenge 
for the year, according to Pope, 
"There were a lot of things lo 
leam and some of the recruiting 
guidelines an? very strict. For 
example, we can call and try ' 



this rule. 

"This iirsi year, we ivere 
basically putting out fires and 
delennining our short-term 

goals," Pope said, "We turned 
\t Soccer Shoiwcase into a rev- 
enue generating event. We part- 
nered with the Alumni 
Assodation and SAB to put on 
Ihe homecominc game and 
events, so we've oeen working 
hard at turning things around,' 



campus average of 2.66. Only 
ttuee athletes were lost related 
lo grades and eligibility rules, 
and all three should be eligible 
again for next year. 

Perhaps one of the greatest 
concerns of those who discour- 
aged IPFW from becoming Dl 
involved the univei^ity's ability 
lo support the program finan- 
cially. According to Pope, all 
aspects considered, the depart- 
ment managed to break even 
this year. The athletics depart- 
ment also provides 78 scholar- 
ships of SIO- 
11,000 each. 



the way games are announced. 
"We're partnering with radio 
and television stations in the 
area and we're going lo try to 
announce the games a week in 
advance," Pope said. 

Athletic events hai'e seen 
increased attendance, as evi- 
denced by Ihe more than 4.000 
farts present for the doublehead- 
er against Morehead Slnle at the 
Coliseum, "At the game, I ivas 
approached by a person who 
commented that more people 
were at that game than were at 
ill of the games last " 



Duld hav 



Ihe other hand, I 

liked lo have had even more 

people there at Ihe Coliseum," 

Other highlights of the year 
included the first-ever home- 
coming game and a double- 
header played in front of a 
packed Gates Center crowd, 

"1 heard a quote the other 
day where it was said that 'tra- 
dition isn't bought, it's earned,' I 
think that that s the case here. 
Through our effort and by mak- 
ing Ihe fans aware of what's 
going on, we hope lo start see- 

of Ihe students coming 

games in support of 



"Finally, ive'd like la see 
each team s win-loss ixcoid 
improve. 1 don't expect unde- 
feated seasons, just that we'll do 
better next lime around, 

"Now the alhleles know 
what it means lo compete in 
Division 1 and ive knoiv (vhat 
ive have lo do for the next year. 
The athletes and coaches are 
going to work on training hard- 
er and we're going to really 
work on buildmg a sense of 
cohesivencss and unity here in 
the department and on Ihe
