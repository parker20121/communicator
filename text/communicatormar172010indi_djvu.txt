It's election season 

Student Government elections start March 16 



By IPSGA Election Board 



When 1PFW opened its doors in the 60s 
and student government began, it was a 
volunieer thing. Today, it's all about business, 
helping and representing students, and more. 
This means expanded events, programs 
and services like Homecoming and Spring 
Fling, featured speakers, calculator and 
camera rentals, and travel expense funds for 
students. IPSGA allocates funds for student 
organizations and makes crucial decisions for 
the student body. 

The four IPSGA officers are paid up to 20 
hours a week for their challenging duties. 
Many of these students manage a full-time 
academic schedule in addition to this. 

The budget has grown from S25.000 to 
more than SI. 400,000. 

It's now the annual election season, which 
starts March 16 when the all time record- 
number 16 candidates start to campaign. 

The election itself is Monday through 
Saturday April 19 to April 24-same week as 
Spring Fling. 

Mere are the candidates. 

For President, there are six: Ryan Flouck, 
Matthew Lash, Terel Lynn, Arthur Mann, Kyle 
Miller, and Thomas Motter. 

For Vice President of Legislation, there are 
five: Anthony Decker. Jonathan Humberson, 
DeAngelo LaVettc, Shante' Smith, and Andrew 



Stackhouse. 

For Vice President of Finance, there are 
four: Patrick Deady, Amanda McCann, Aimee 
Springer, and Eric Smith. 

ForVice President of Programming, there is 
one: Nikita "Niki" Mathews. 

The Election Board has two major events 
planned for the weeks leading up to the 
election. The first is the "Meet &amp; Greet Your 
Student Government Election Candidates" 
event planned for Thursday. March 25 from 
11:45 to 1:30 pm around the main staircase in 
the Walb Student Union. Students can meet 
and mingle with candidates and ask questions 
about their platforms. 

The second major event is a two-part 
series of "Candidate Open Forums" planned 
for Wednesday, April 7 from 2:00 pm to 4:00 in 
Walb 222/224/226 and Thursday, April 8 from 
noon to 2:00 pm in the Walb Ballroom. These 
two forums will be debate-style events where 
candidates answer questions from the IPFW 
community. 

If interested in being a poll worker for the 
election, interviews will be March 22-March 
26.

COM Department: New Faculty 



By Kristan Mensch

In recent weeks, the Communication Department 
has set up times for undergraduate and graduate 
students to meet with candidates Forfaculry positions. 

Marcia Dixson, chair of the Communication 
Department, said "We lake the teaching part of our 
role very seriously and 
one of the best ways to see 
if someone is likely to be 
a good teacher is to put 
him or her in a classroom, 
observe his or her teaching 
and get feedback from our 
students." 

In turn, Communication students have had the Rhetoric, 
opportunity io meet with the candidates as well as Hess acquired 

witnessthemasaguestinstructorsandevaluatetheir University, concentrating in rhetoric and public 
performance. Dixson said. advocacy, ethnography and health communication. 



"While the position [for a new faculty 

member] has not yet been filled, 

the Communication department is 

looking for a candidate to teack media 

production classes," 



Now. after students have been able to acquaint 
themselves, all but one of the positions have been 
filled. 

Assem Nasr will be taking on the position in Media 
and Communication. 

"He will bring diversity to the department in 
terms of his research with television advertising 
and Lebanese identity," said Dixson. adding "he is 
finishing his Ph.D. at the 
University of Texas, Austin 
and has an MDA in Film 
and Electronic Media from 
American University in 
Washington, D.C." 

In addition, Aaron Hess 
was hired for a position in 



Ph.D. from Arizona State 



Dixson explained. 

While Hess' expertise is in Rhetoric, "his work 
extends into digital media which is a direction we feel 
the department needs to move," Dixson said. 

A Digital Media position has been filled will) 
Barbara Smith, who earned a Ph.D. from the 
University of Florida, according to Dixson. 

"Her research area is media law ... and she has 
both teaching and professional experience with 
print, broadcast and online journalism," said Dixson. 

While the position has not yet been filled, 
the Communication department is looking for a 
candidate to teach media production courses and 
help to further the course toward digital media. 

The ways in which communication works change 
every day, and in recent years ii has evolved quickly 
to the technological age. IPFW has been right behind 
those changes by keeping Communication students 
up-to-date and keeping fresh-minded, well educated 
people on staff. 



Saving Books, Saving the Earth 



By Kelly McLendon 

mi I c n d o n I tl !j« gnu il . torn 



6.398. That's the number of books that have been 
recycled by the Walter E.Helmke Library, in addition, 
45,970 gallons of water, 17 cubic yards of landfill 
space and 106 trees have been saved. 

The project started with the removal of old books 
from the library. The books in Helmke have not 
been sorted through in more than twenty years. This 
means older books with too many copies that do 
not regularly get checked out are just sitting around, 
taking up unnecessary space for new endeavors. 

"We're getting ready to make the second floor into 
something new called The Uncommon Commons." 
In order to bring that about, we had to empty the 
second floor." Information Assistant Deborah Kelley 
said. 

In order to make changes to update the selection, 
the library has been working with BetterWorld Books 
and its sub-company, Books for Africa. This is the 
company that has helped them recycle old books. 

Cheryl Truesdell, Library Dean, had the idea to 



start the program after talking with another librarian. 

"I heard about this program through a colleague 
who is the Library Director at another IU campus 
library. He had been using this organization for about 
a year and was impressed with their commitment 
and mission," she said. 

Kelley got involved with the project because 
Truesdell knew about her history. 

"Cheryl knows I was a hippie. I went to Woodstock. 
1 protested in Chicago and Detroit. She knew I would 
love something that would save the trees," Kelley said. 

She has been working since she was seventeen to 
"make the world a better place." 

Truesdell says she got Kelley involved in the 
project because, "Deb works at the Service Desk and 
was interested in the project. Deb has an interest in 
charitable organizations and deeds, so this resonated 
with her." 

Although the project is close to Kelleys heart, the 
whole library has a team working to decide what is too 
old to be of any value and what has too many copies. 
Those books are then removed from the database 
and Kelley runs them through the better world books 
site. They can either be sold or sent to Africa, or more 



books can be bought. 

But Kelley says the big benefit is the impact on the 
environment. 

"I'm celebrating the fact that we've saved over 
100 trees," Kelley said. "I'm proud of the fact that we 
are doing something good, rather than let them go to 
waste." 

Fewer than 100 boxes are shipped at a time and 
BetterWorld books comes to the library to pick them 
up. The company even sends the boxes used to put 
the books in. They are then sent to war and religiously 
torn places in Africa. 

"We have people that we know from Africa, so we 
know where this is going and where it's really needed. 
We have people going there and coming back and 
telling us what it's doing and that's really good." 
Kelley said. 

After saving water, landfill space and trees, an 
electricity impact has also been achieved. Truesdell 
said through the library's donations, 20,906 Kxh of 
electricity has been saved.

Smoke Hut Diaries 



By Robin Crowell 

robmyou'qravca gnui Lcom 



As my spring break draws to a 
close, il brings upon me a time of 
reflection for all of the things that 
I've been doing wrong and all of 
the wrongdoings that I've seen in 
the faces of others. 

I bring myself back to times, 
hours spent sitting in the 
smoke hut and staring through 
the tar-stained glass watching 
people pass by. 1 look at their 
faces and see fractions of their 
troubles. I hear them speak, 
muffled by distance, to their 
cell phones complaining about 
arrays of things that can be 
changed. I sit across from people 
complaining about their classes, 
complaining about professors, 
complaining about work-loads, 
and complaining about the lives 
they lead. Why not change it? 

I've put the issues of others 



on the platter for people to read 
about, now here is a taste of 
my own. I have been drudging 
around Fort Wayne for the last 
few years since I graduated high 
school wondering what the hell 
I was doing. I don't want to 
be here and the odds are that 
neither do most of you. I have no 

"I sit across from people 

complaining about classes... 

professors... work-loads... 

Why not change it?" 



desire to search for contentment 
in a town that has done nothing 
but laughed in my face about all 
of the opportunities that I could 
be finding elsewhere. 

I hate to sound like the 
screaming cry of another 'grass 
is greener 1 story, but in the case 
of Fort Wayne, I'm afraid that it's 
true. I hear people in the smoke 



hut talk about the happiness 
they have found elsewhere and 
the regret that resonates in their 
voices when they speak of having 
to return to Fort Wayne. I don't 
want to submit myself to that. 

What I would love to submit 

myself to, though, is opportunity. 

I want to write. I want to read. I 

want to stay soft, not hardened 

by the ferocities of Indiana 

winters. I want to flourish 

on my own terms and not 

when this black hole of a town 

decides to let me. Not only do 

I want to search for myself, I 

want to search for the world. 

It's a shame that the majority 

of people that I've talked to 

in these smoke huts are just 

content in sitting around and 

waiting until this city decides to 

let them save their lives. It's up 

to the individual to save their 

own life, and I ask all of you to 

please stop waiting around and 

do something to save yours. 



The Stop Dating Show: A New Column 



By Wil Upchurch &amp; Bernadette Gleeson 



Two IPFW students are hoping to make a big 
splash in the world of dating.. .without ever setting 
foot in a movie theater or bar. 

Bernadette Gleeson and Wil Upchurch, graduate 
students in the Department of Communication, 
are currently writing a book on the pitfalls of 
communication in dating. Like many of the great 
projects of the last century, this one has its beginnings 
in a car. Sitting at the stoplight at Crescent and 
Anthony, Upchurch was thinking about the dating 
woes of some of his friends. That's when the idea 
came to him in the form of a book tide, "Stop Dating! 
The Art and Science of Spending Time and Falling in 
Love." 

But Upchurch knew he couldn't do it alone. 

And that's when he called on his friend and 
colleague. Gleeson. 

At its core, the duo's philosophy breaks down the 
barriers erected by the language of dating in modern 
culture. 

In addition to writing the book, the pair is 
developing several outlets to get their message out to 
those who need it most. 



Send your questions to 
wil@istopdating,com &amp; 
bernadette@istopdating.com 



Starting next week, the two will be writing a dating 
and relationship advice column. The Q&amp;A column 
will answer questions from readers about dating and 
relationships with a focus on communication issues, 
anxiety and strategies for building more successful 
relationships. 

Also available will be The Stop Dating Show!, 
a weekly podcast available for download at their 
website, http://www.istopdating.com. A lively and 
fresh take on the woes of dating, each show will 
take a look at how the language of dating inhabits 
our culture. Dating books, personal ad profiles, 
movies and pop culture.. .nothing is safe from Wil 
and Bemadette's commentary and critique. Send a 
question and it may appear in next week's column. 

Appearances: 

March 22 7:00pm: The show will present, 
"Revealing Myths of Relationship Advice," as part 
ofCOMWeek.CM144. 

April 26 7:00pm: The Stop Dating Show Live! 
comes to the Dash-In Cafe", located downtown 
on Calhoun St. This monthly event brings all 
the humor and insight from the podcast to a 
live audience, with events like Bad Date Idol and

entertaining evening.

Reflections on Google 
Buzz at One Month OpEd 



By Alex Axthelm 
uthim0iattudenU.1pfW.tdu 



Google recently launched Google Buzz, a social 
networking and sharing site, as part of their Gmail 
suite. However, since its launch, it has been paluted 
with problems. While it is stable software, Google's 
deployment of Buzz left much to be desired. At first, 
Buzz automatically followed the user's most frequent 
contacts in Gmail. The list of frequent contacts was 
easily accessible to the public. Google still has not 
taken steps to ensure that this information is private 
by default, though they have changed the "auto- 
follow" to "auto-suggest", which encourages the user 
to follow their friends. Users still have to take specific 
steps to ensure their privacy. Unfortunately, Buzz is 
integrated with Gmail, so all Gmail users are part of 
Buzz, and have to take these steps. However, Buzz con 
be easily disabled under Gmail's "Settings -&gt; Buzz -&gt; 
Disable Google Buzz." 

Buzz's greater problem is that it is a service without 
a reason. The privacy concerns could possibly be 
overlooked if the service was useful enough. Buzz 
seems to be little more than an aggregator for the 
user's social media. Many users use it as an echo for 
Twitter, Flickr, and other social media sites. Buzz acts 
as a catchall, collecting everything the user's contacts 
post, and delivers it to them without filtering for 
quality or content. The best friend's Flickr photos of 
last night's party are placed right next to the crazy 
uncle's Twitter posts. Buzz's so-called advantage, 
is that it allows users to comment on the content it 
delivers; this commenting function doesn't integrate 
with any of the other services though. The comments 
madeonaFlicrpictureinBuzzwillnevershowupon 
that picture's Flickr comments. The two systems are 
entirely separate. 

Buzz is has been poorly executed. Between 
the privacy concerns, and the lack of original 
functionality. Buzz has been a fiasco from the start. 
While it was an interesting idea, and certainly had the 
audience from Gmaii, it failed to provide anything 
new that would make people want to use it.

Anthony Gaff Performs at Firefly Coffe&lt; 
House over Spring Break 



By Holly Gallaway 

9 Jll haO 1 Oiiud (nil I p Sv «tu 

While most Students gel away from 
Fort Wayne. Anthony Gaff is a student who 
stays in town and keeps busy during spring 
break. On Friday, March 12. Gaff performed 
an acoustic concert at the Firefly Coffee 
1 louse. Gaff (better known around town as 
Garr) played his guitar for two hours with a 
short break somewhere in the middle. He 
performed original songs as well us a few 
covers, including Outkast's "Hey Va," Chris 
Cornell's version of "Kiltie lean," and Lady 
Gaga's "Poker Face." The version of "Billie 



lean" was the same song Gaff performed 
in late November for the first round of 
Indiana's Got Talent. 

"The Firefly has a serene atmosphere, 
and with Anthony's variety of songs it makes 
for a great way to unwind after a long day.'* 
said IPFW studont Eric Farr. 

Those who visit the Firefly know the 
coffeehouse has a very calming, yet fun, 
atmosphere. This fits perfectly with Gaff's 
solo acoustic performance. It also gives him 
the opportunity, it seems, to completely let 
go and let the music take control. From 
the viewpoint of an audience member, it 
was very refreshing to witness some'Nng 



of Uiat nature, rather than a performet 
on autopilot and just play their music. ( 
seemed to sincerely love what he was do: 
A true performer, he also interacted with 
crowd, which included a few IPFW studc 
and Gaff's wife and son. Every now i 
then during die concert. Gaff would eit 
share a quick comment from his son ab 
"zombies eating all the pizza" or thank 
two workers for being amazing baristas. 
IPFW student Deanna Hoop adc 
"It is nice to be able to take my son to 
live music... It's a great environment 
relaxing with the family and enjoying sc 
good acoustic music."

Artist: Rocky Voiolato 
Album: True Devotion 
Label: Barsuk 

Release Date: February 23, 2010 
Rating: 4/5 

Sounds Like: A man singing of love for 
his family and his music. 

Every song on this album is laden 
with honesty and devotion, hence the 
album's title. 

Breaking free from a dry spell in 
writing, Votolato dedicates this album 
to the family that has held so much 
inspiration to him. The songs are clearly 
singing of said dedication especially 
in tracks like "Lucky Clover Coin" and 
"Sun Devil," about his son and his wife, 
respectively. 



Not only is this album full of love 
and clarity, the metaphors utilized ring 
true to everyone; they are complex and 
poetic, resonating clear in the ears of 
intelligent listeners. Also, the simplicity 
implemented on this album does not 
compromise its power. Each song on the 
album the listener can relate to in different 
ways, pending the listener has experienced 
any kind of love in their life. 

In the final track entitled "Where 
We Started," the clarity sung in the phrase 
"You can be free if you decide to be" strikes 
listeners where it counts. It's meaningful 
in that each and every day we complain 
about the ties that bind us but in actuality 
we choose to be bound by them. This 
album commences Votolato's decision not 
to be bound.

Artist: Johnny Cash 
Album: American VI: Ain't No Grave 
Label: American Recordings 
Release Date: February 23, 2010 
Rating: 4/5 

Sounds Like: Life lessons preached 
with one foot in the grave. 



The American series by Johnny Cash 
follows the format of very few songs being 
Cash originals and the rest being covers, 
this album being the leading example. 
Though only one song on the album is a 
Cash original, the other nine songs seem 
as though they were strategically picked to 
execute the message that he was looking 



for. 

As death rings clearly in his voice, this 
album is not beating the dead horse that is 
Cash's death. It feels entirely necessary for 
an album like this to be released. Mostly, 
the songs sound as if he is staring into 
the eyes of his God, waiting to be carried 
away. It speaks through the lyricsof other 
musicians and songwriters, peacefully 
questioning his existence on earth and 
preaching about contentment not in 
money, but in a satisfied mind. 

Though it is clear that Cash had some 
hard times, this album makes it clear that 
the hardships were worth it and the life that 
he lead was both troubling and rewarding; 
ringing clarity to his years walked on earth.

Poverty at IPFW 



By Kristen Mensch 



The Center for Women and Returning Adults 
(CWHA) was founded at JPFW In the 1980s 
because most students commuted and were non- 
tradltlonal students - meaning they were either the-year unemployment 



cturning lo college after an extended period or 
were beginning college for the first lime at an 
older age, said CWHA coordinator Julie Creek. 

Most non-lraditional college students have to 
balance - among other responsibilities - children, 
work and school, 

"We try to help students balance those 
responsibilities," said Creek, 
adding that ihey show 
returning adults where to 
find affordable child care, 
access food stamps or food 
banks and any number of 
other resources In order to 
help them stay in school. 

"A broken legcan cause total havoc forfamilies," 
Creek said. With tuillon, books, rent, a car. a family 
and a number of other financial obligations, a 
roof over-head, a family's well-being and reliable 
transportation tend to outweigh education. 

In Fall 2007, 32 percent of undergraduates 



the nation. 

Creeksaid thai the recession knocked the wind 
out of a lot of people who were doing perfectly 
fine before. In addition, financially struggling 
returning adults were piling into the CWRA offices 
last Spring when the recession was at its worst. 

Indiana ranks 45 among the states in over- 
;, according to the 



"Indiana ranks 45 among 

the states in over-the- 

year unemployment rates, 

according to the Bureau of 

Labor Statistics" 



Bureau of Labor Statistics, going from 5.8 percent 
in 2008 to 10.1 percent in 2009. With a difference 
of 4.3 percent representing lost jobs, it qualifies as 
a statistically significant change in employment. 

"It's hard to keep the kids getting their work 
done, fed, exercised and socialized and still have 
time for my work," said Dawn Link, mother of 
three and non-traditional 
student at Ross Medical 
Education Center, adding 
that she has "no money to 
step back and take a break." 
In turn, NCES also shows 
that 57 percent of IPFW 
students are receiving federal 
loans, with the average amount being $3,594. 

In addition, NCES shows that another six 
percent of IPFW students receive other types of 
loans, with the average amount being $6,927. 

Also, the default rate for the 2007 fiscal year 
is 7.4 percent. That means that 7.4 percent of 



at I PFW were 25 years of age or older, according borrowers who began to repay their loans at IPFW 

lo the National Center for Education Statistics in 2007 default by the end of the next fiscal year, 

(NCES). Of course, since the recession began according to the U.S. Department of Education 

In December 2007, according to the National Official Cohort Default Rates for IPFW. 
Bureau of Economic Research, many adults who In a world where a college degree is almost

The men's and women's basketball 
teams both had seasons that will be one 
for the record books. Two women, Stepha- 
nie Roasdo and Anne Boese both grabbed 
All-League honors for 1PFVV, putting Icing 
on the cake for both of their fantastic sea- 
sons. For the men, it was senior forward 
Deilvez Yearby picking up All-Summit 
League Second Team honors after a great 
season. Yearby was the big man inside all 
season for IPFW, having his biggest game 
against national powerhouse Michigan 
State in East Lansing, Michigan. 

For the women, the season was finished 
just three games under the .500 mark at 
13-16. Unfortunately, the season ended in 
the opening round of the Summit League 
Conference Tournament on the home 
floor of the tournament host South Dakota 
State in front of over 5,000 fans. Stepha- 
nie Roasdo led the Women throughout the 
season scoring an average of 13.2 points 
per game. 

For the men, the season was the best 
yet since IPFW went division 1. For the 
first time, the season ended for IPFW with 
a record of 16-15, one game above the .500 
mark, fust like the women's team, the men 
were forced to face tournament host South 
Dakota State in the first round. The men 
played with fire, and bounced the Jack- 
rabbits in front of over 5,000 fans on their 
home court. Unfortunately, the season 
ended for IPFW in the tournament semi- 
finals against league champion Oakland 
University, who went on to win the tour- 
nament and make another appearance in 
the NCAA tc 

Leading the Men this season was the 
big man inside Deilvez Yearby. Yearby av- 
eraged 13.8 points per game, and scored a 
team leading 414 points this season. Year- 
by finished his career at IPFW this season 
leaving with the best record in school his- 
tory. The Men and Women are both look- 
ing forward to a short offseason before 
they are back hard at work on the court 
preparing for the 2010-2011 season.

NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Week Edition 



By Lucas Fisher 

tuco'Ut 080 I omul 1 . rift 

While we were on spring break the 
NCAA was determining automatic 
bids for March Madness. There were 
classic games all week long that broke 
(he hearts and daggered the dreams of 
players, coaches, fans, and students that 
had hopes of making it to the big dance. 

On March 5th the first bid was 
given out to Cornell (Ivy League). 
Then on March 6th three more teams 
punched their tickets to the dance as 
East Tennessee State (Atlantic Sun), 
Winthrop (Big South), 
and Murray State 
[Ohio Valley). March 
7th only on bid was 
given out and that 
was to Northern Iowa 
(Missouri Valley). As 
Monday the 8th came 
around four more 
teams locked up a 
spot for the madness 
Wofford (Southern), 
Siena (MAAC), Saint 
Mary's (West Coast), 
and Old Dominion 
(Colonial). On March 
9th three more mid 
majors made it to the 
tournament Butler 
(Horizon), North 

Texas (Sun Belt), and 
Oakland (Summit ). On 
March 10th two more teams punched 
their tickets Robert Morris (Northeast) 
and Montana (Big Sky). March 1 1th 
no bids were given out but the major 
conference tournaments started. On 
March 12th on team clinched a bid and 
that was Lehigh (Patriot). The most bids 
were given out on March I3th when 
Washington (Pac-10), San Diego State 
(Mountain West). Ohio (MidAmerican), 
Houston (Conference USA), UC Santa 
Barbara (Big West), West Virginia 




(Big East). Kansas (Big 12), Vermont 
(American East), Morgan State (MEAC), 
New Mexico State (WAC), Arkansas 
Pine Bluff (SWAC). and Sam Houston 
(Southland) all won their conference 
tournaments. Then on March 14 th the 
final four automatic bids were given 
out when Ohio State (Big Ten), Temple 
(Atlantic 10), Duke (ACC). and Kentucky 
(SEC) won their games. 

When determining the automatic 
bids via a conference tournament 
teams that are on the bubble have 
two options; 1. Win their conference 
tournament or 2. Lose and hope that 
their resume is good 
enough to make 
the dance. Teams 
that took away bids 
from bubble teams 
are called bubble 
busters. This year 
New Mexico State 
(WAC) and Houston 
IConf. USA) were the 
two biggest bubble 
busters. Nobody 
expected them to 
earn an automatic 
bid but they did and 
that topk away spots 
in the tournament 
from Illinois, 

Mississippi State, or 
Virginia Tech who 
were all snubbed. 

In the Big 
East tournament 
Syracuse. Villanova, and Pittsburgh 
all lost their first game after a double 
bye, causing some controversy. But 
the other team that had a double bye, 
West Virginia, ended up winning the 
tournament after some heroics by 
Da'Sean BuUer scoring the deciding 
points in all three games. Now it is time 
for even more March Madness as the 
big dance starts up on Thursday.

2-5 on the night. 

Moving on to the final spring fling, 
IPFW was able to start off stong with 
14 runs in the first two innings as they

Junior Rachel Staschuk picked up 
her second win in a row, as she threw a 
five strike-out match. 

Staschuk also led the game off with 
a single then allowed Wolfe to square

Sara Hopwood then doubled, scoring 
Staschuk. Cronin followed close dou- 
bling herself and scored Hopwood.
