INDIANA-PURDUE UNIVERSITY, FORT WAYNE, 



Indiana-Purdue to get super-chancellor 



By MARK FRANKE 

Indiana-Purdue will finally get its 
super-chancellor, according to an 
agreement reached by John W. Ryan, 
president of Indiana University, and 
Arthur G. Hansen, president of 
Purdue University. The agreement 
calls for the chancellor to be chosen 
and begin work no later than July 1, 
1974. 

The agreement also establishes 
Purdue as the fiscal agent for IU-PU, 
but with the campus business 
manager reporting directly to the 
chancellor. 

A third point in the agreement 
requests the IU-PU faculty to develop 



academic s 

The super-chancellor will report 
directly to the president of each 
institution. This appears to eliminate 
the regional campus administrations 
of both universities as management 
units for the Fort Wayne Campus. 

The two presidents will begin 
their search for the new administrat- 
or as soon as possible. It is expected 
that some sort of search committee 
will be formed from IU-PU constit- 

Two weeks ago, Student Body 
President Brock Able called for 
one-third student representation on 
this proposed committee. 



By establishing Purdue as the 
campus fiscal agent, all business 
functions will be handled through one 
office. This will eliminate the present 
need for two separate business 
offices. 

The new chief campus business 
officer will report to the chancellor on 
his operations as business manager, 



The present Purdue Business 
Manager reports directly to his 
superior in West Lafayette, and is not 
responsible to the Purdue Dean and 
Director. 

The merged business offices will 
also mean a single IU-PU budget, 
rather than the dual budget existing 
now. Space utilization ratios, where 
the expenses of running joint opera- 
tions arecharged to the two universi- 
ties according to student enrollments, 
will become things of the past. 

A unified budget should allow for 
economies of scale in operations and 
reduced duplication of programs. 

The fiscal vice presidents of the 
two universities will work out the 
details of the new financial manage- 
ment for IU-PU. Those changes that 
will require General Assembly ap- 
proval will go before the 1974 session. 

Any new fiscal arrangements to 
be instituted will take effect on July 1, 



year begins. 

The IU-PU faculty will be asked 
to make recommendations on the 
internal university governance mech- 
anisms. Specific topics for discussion 
likely will be a merged faculty s&gt; 



the 



the

grams. 

The presidential agreement calls 
for student participation in this 
process wherever appropriate. 

The announcement by the presi- 
dents of the two universities culmi- 
nates a number of weeks of 
speculation about the future of IU-PU. 
Many faculty, as witnessed by a 
faculty poll and a vote of the Purdue 
Faculty Senate, have advocated

The issue came to boil with the 
release of the controversial Keenan 
Report, which recommended com- 
plete independence for IU-PU. The 
report did accept the super-chancel- 
lor plan as a tolerable short-run 
alternative to the present system.

Dean and Director Roger J. Manges informs faculty and staff members of the 
super-chancellor agreement reached by the two university presidents. 



Advanced registration to 
begin for spring semester 



Pre-registration for the spring 
semester will be conducted for all 
IU-PU students from November 12 
through November 30, 1973, with the 
exception of November 21, 22, and 23. 
Registration may be completed from 
8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Monday 
through Thursday and from 8:00 a.m. 
to 5:00 p.m. on Friday in the 
Registrars Office, Room G57, Kettler 



Each university will operate its 
registration somewhat differently. 
Both Purdue and Indiana students 
should note the procedure for 
advanced registration. 

Purdue students should obtain a 
counseling permit from the regis- 
trar's office and then make an 



appointment with their academic 
advisor to determine a suitable 
schedule for spring. After the student 
has seen his advisor, he should then 
return his course request card to the 
registrar's office for class verifica- 
tion and final processing. 

Indiana students should see their 
Division Office first to obtain a 
registration form. If they should need 
counseling relative to course selec- 
tion, they should also request it at that 
time. After Indiana's students have 
chosen their program they must 
submit their completed registration 
form to the registrar's office. The 
students will then be asked to 
complete a student data card before 



Once the student has completed 
the appropriate process in registra- 
tion he is guaranteed his course 
selections, providing his fees are paid 
before January 4, 1974. 

After November 30, 1973, no 
program changes will be possible 
until January 14-18, 1974. 



Editor's note 

Editor's note: Beginning 
with this issue, the Commun- 
icator is no longer free of 
charge to the general public. 
The paper will still be free to 
activity card holders. 

This change in policy 
was more or less imposed by 
the administration of the 
university in spite of the 
objections of the manage- 
ment of the Communicator. 
The new policy displeases us 
as much as it may you. 
Please bear with us until 
such time as the policy can 
be changed.

The history of cooperation 

AN ANALYSIS 



Purdue classes were initiated using 
Indiana facilities. This loose coopera- 
tion lasted until January, 1958, when 



its Board of Directors members of the 
Purdue Board of Trustees, the 
Indiana Board of Trustees, and the 
local contributor group which initially 
provided approximately $200,000 in 
capital funds for the site, 

A joint committee for the two 
universities completed a study of 
(acuity requirements in June 1960, at 
which time architectural planning 
and construction of the first building 



proceeded on the present 365-acre 

In April 1962, in the interest of 
economy and educational quality, the 
two universities agreed to assign 
administrative functions as follows: 
to Indiana University-library opera- 
tion, community service operation, 
and bookstore operation; to Purdue 
University -physical plant mainten- 
ance and operation, tudent activities 
operation, and food services opera- 
tion. In addition it was agreed thai the 
space assignment function, the as- 
signment of classrooms, etc., would 
be rotated annually between the two 



Charge-back and cross-hilling 
arrangements were developed; since 
occupancy of the first building in 
September of 1964 each university 
paid its share of the rent to the 
Foundation and its share of the 
operating cost based upon its space 
utilization related to Ms proportion nf 
students. 

At the lime of the move to the 
present campus site in September of 
1964, considerable duplication of the 
academic mission existed. In 1966, in 
it of academic planning and 



distributed between the two institu- 
tions. At present, with the exception 
of English, where both institutions 
still maintain departments, only one 
university has the "mission" in any 
particular field for the purpose of 
serving studenLs of both universities. 
English remains duplicative because 
there is sufficient student volume that 
neither academic quality nor econ- 
omy is threatened by continuing two 
separate units. 

Following the assignment of 
academic missions, course equiva- 
lency tables were developed in each 
field. The result is that students from 
both universities sit in the same 
classes, with Indiana students enroll- 
ed under an I.U. number, and Purdue 
students enrolled under a P.U. 
number, 

In 1968 the two separate financial 



office administers all scholarship, 
loan, and work-study programs for 
the entire student body. 

Building and planning, including 
lonjvlerm planning, has been accom- 
plished jointly from the beginning. 
However, each university originally

Purdue chapter of the AAUP, and 
accepted by all present members of 
the joint chapters of the AAUP in a 
meeting at the Indiana-Purdue Fort 
Wayne campus on November 5, 1973. 

This proposal was brought forth 
in conjunction with the acceptance of 
the resolution by the faculty majority 
that Fort Wayne Indiana-Purdue 
University should become a unified 
and independently state-supported 
college. 

This meeting of the joint chapt- 
ers, labeled The Administrative 
Structure Deficiency Forum (ASDF), 
was to initially formalize and identify 
the specifics of the "independent and 
unified administration proposal." 
Since it is rumoredthat discussions 
are presently being conducted be- 
tween the Universities, the AAUP 
joint chapter Presidents felt that the 
AAUP should ensure that the specif- 
ics of their concerns are transmitted 
to the Presidents of the two 
Universities.

otherwise. Dr. Stephen Haroff stre 
sed the fact that "If

Steven Hollander opened discus- 
sion on a planned single administra- 
tion. He proposed that "The introduc- 
tion of a single administration should 
result in a decrease in the total 
number of administrators." Dr. 
Onwood later emphasized that "This 
campus should have a single budget." 

If the administrations become 
unified, there will be a Super 
Chancellor, which the AAUP mem- 
bers have defined as the Chief 
Administrations Officer. This will 
definitely eliminate several of the 
higher positions that now represent 
two schools. Nothing is in the 
operational stage yet regarding the 
single unified administration, but the 
AAUP feels it is important to take 
early action on the basis that it will 
allow the faculty to have substantial 

There are now two separate 
budgets for Indiana and Purdue at 
Fort Wayne, and it should be known 
that Indiana-Purdue Fort Wayne has 



been underbudgetted like all of the 
other regional campuses, because the 
main campuses don't care enough 
' about the budgets of their regional 
campuses. They are only seriously 
concerned about their own budgets. 
Several AAUP members propos- 
ed that the budget should be 
generated here, and won't be able to 
be altered by Bloomington or Lafay- 
ette. One budget should go out; if the 
parent campuses want to split it, 
that's their choice. The final concen- 
sus of the group was, "A single budget 
for this campus should be developed 
here (Fort Wayne) without arbitrary

Administrative Office. Faculty memb 
ers suggested criteria for this 
position. It was noted that the person

appointment was discussed, and 
was finally proposed by Dr. McCants 
that there should be a choice of 1-3

that it might be decided by the 
majority of the faculty.

recommendation number 1 that the

Board of Trustees, because they have 
become more aware "that continu- 
ance of the status quo had become 
unacceptable, and that continuation 
of any sort of dependency relationship 
with Bloomington or Lafayette was 
undesirable." 

Dr. David McCants initially 
suggested that the AAUP should "try 
to identify some procedures that 
would be a more direct way of 
approaching the Presidents and 
Boards of Trustees." McCants asked 
the group, "Why conduct additional

Finally! 



It's about damn time! As crude as it may sound, that may be the best 
way to describe the relief felt on this campus with the announcement of 
the presidential agreement establishing the super-chancellor position. 

It is a sorry commentary on the state of affairs in both university 
administrations that it took public pressure for complete independence to 
force them to take any action on the IU-PU administrative mess. 

Faculty groups and others had to make a lot of noise about complete 
separation from the parent campuses before the problem was resolved. 
The Keenan Report, recommending independence also, nudged the two 
presidents along, no doubt. 

But we have finally been given our super -chancellor. It is much too 
early to tell whether or not this plan will work to the benefit of IU-PU. 

The first unknown is the type of man that will be chosen for the 
position. He will have to be of very strong character to work the miracles 
that are expected of him. 

Secondly, there is no guarantee that the fiscal arrangements will be 
any better than they are now. We will still have a "Purdue" business 
office, responsible to Lafayette at least in part. The unresponsiveness of 
the present Purdue Business Office to IU-PU needs is a nightmare that 
we care not to experience again. 

Fortunately, the plan has some promising aspects. The new business 
manager will report to the super-chancellor, and not completely 
circumvent him as is the case now. 

There will be one budget for the entire campus. This may result in 
more money from the state legislature, or at least allow for more efficient 
expenditure of that money. 

The new system will allow for more flexibility in decision-making 
when dealing with specific Fort Wayne problems. With a strong 
super-chancelloranda little help from Lady Luck, we should derive some 
special IU-PU system by drawing on the strengths of both present 
systems. 

We wish the presidents luck in the search for a superman, and a 
superman he will have to be. And we wish him the best of luck as he 
pursues his difficult course. 

It's about damn time, but at least it has finally happened. 

The genesis of it all 

In the beginning there was the Business Office. And the Business 
Manager said, "Let there be rules and regulations." And there were 
rules and regulations for everything, from the hanging of book shelves to 
the installation of telephones. And the Business Manager looked at the 
rules and regulations, and they were good. 

But the Business Manager said, "I have no one to enforce these rules 
and regulations" And the Business Manager created administrators to 
enforce the rules and regulations, and to each administrator he gave an 
assistant, so that they may not be wearied in their tasks. 

But the administrators cried, "We have no one upon which we can 
enforce these rules and regulations" So the Business Manager created 
the university with classes, credits, and degrees. And into the university 
he placed students and faculty. And the students and faculty were 
created in his own image, and they obeyed the rules and regulations 
without question, and it was good. 

But into the university came a serpent, and this was the serpent of 
academic service to the community. And the serpent tempted the 
faculty, saying, "Why do you obey rules and regulations that serve no 
purpose. Are you not here to teach? These rules and regulations just get 
in your way." And the faculty doubted. And this doubt spread to the 
students, and the students and faculty sinned against the Business Office. 

And the Business Manager was angry. And he sought out the faculty 
and students that sinned, and he chastised them for their transgressions. 

And unto the faculty, he said, "Because you have sinned, I will 
greatly multiply your pain in teaching. I will add great trials and 
tribulations to your lives and careers. And you shall constantly wonder 
what the meaning of it all is. And you shall not know where the money 
goes, for it shall not go to you." 

And unto the students, he said, "Since you have sinned with the 
faculty, you shall suffer with the faculty. You shall pay to park in a 
magnificent building, but you shall be forced to park amidst the 
chuckholes and dust. You shall be taxed for your activities, but I shall use 
this money to create more rules and regulations, and the money shall be 
spent as I see fit, and you shall be sorely grieved. Cursed will be your 
Union, and it shall be closed much of the time." 

And he said to both the students and the faculty, "Cursed shall be 
your lives at the university, for you shall feel censored and threatened all 
the time. You will be told nothing, for all will be kept secret. And I shall 
make you ini-^r^ble by creating still more rules and regulations, and you 
will obey, or be cast out from the university forever;'* 

And the Business Manager placed a great policy manual at the 
' e to his office, and he caused the students and faculty to bow down 

t every day. And it was good. 



Drugs pushed 
down throats 



Editor's note: This is the last of 
three articles about America's so- 
called "drug culture," the govern- 
ment's efforts to control the pharma- 
ceutical industry and the advertisers 
who plug Its products. 

By FRANK MACOMBER 

The U.S. pharmaceutical indus- 
try is spending millions each year 
promoting the sale of so-called 
"psycho-active" drugs which at best 
can do no more than make people feel 
a little more comfortable in unpleas- 
ant surroundings. 

Some promotions even indicate 
that everybody in the country needs 
some kind of psycho-active drug 
crutch to make it in a topsy-turvy 

That's the judgment of Sen. 

Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis., chairman of 
the Senate Small BusinessCommit- 
tees monopoly subcommittee which 
has been investigating the drug 
industry since 1967. 

"The sharply increased use of 
psycho-active drugs presents the 
most satisfaclory-from the industry's 
point of view- return on sales effort,'" 



eludes, "would have us believe that 
we are all suffering from mental 
illness and should \w lakiny psydia 
tropic drugs. ..The industry is telling 
us that it is unnecessary to try to stop 
noise, pollution, traffic jams and 
energy scarcities. Just take a pill 
which will help you adjust to the 
existing situation." 

Federal agencies are making

psycho-active drugs. 

Recently the drug enforcement 
arm of the Food and Drug Adminis- 
tration (FDA) moved to restrict the 
use of librium and valium, tranquili- 
zers prescribed most often for 
middle-class, middle-age women. It 
cited potential abuse as grounds for 
the proposal. 

The FDA has banned the nonpre- 
scription sale of vitamins A and D in 
high-concentration doses. The agency 
also has ordered the nation's drug 
firms to submit a list of all products 
containing trichloroethane, a chemi- 
cal it said may have b 
for several deaths. 

In the field of advertising, the 
Federal Trade Commission has 
accused leading aspirin manufactur- 
ers of false and misleading claims. On 
another front Federal Communica- 
tions Commissioner Nicholas Johnson 
assailed drug commercials and called 
television "the pusher." 

As early as last Feb. 21, television 
industry officials voluntarily announ- 
ced stiff new rules regulating 
non-prescriptive drug advertising. 
The rules prohibit such advertising

these drugs trough intensive promo- 
tion than for any other class of drugs. 
The reason, according to testimony 
before our subcommittee, is that a 
large percentage of patients who 
come to see a physician have vague, 
undefined psychogenic complaints 
that do not have specific physiologic 
origins. 

"We have found that the drug 
industry is expending huge resources 
to enlarge the concept of mental 
disease by redefining everyday hu- 
man problems as psychiatric prob- 
lems, thus making them appropriate 
subjeevts for drug treatment." 

Then Nelson cites these rather 
startling examples:

get along with her new daughter-in- 
law. The executive who can't accept 
retirement." 

The senator points out that "no

that he was unfunny, and more often

Spirit lifter 
of the week 



By RUTH STAFFORD PEALE 

Worry, says a psychiatrist, is the 
great modern plague. When it is 
chronic, all your thoughts become 
tinctured with worry. What can be 
done to correct this situation? 
Cultivate faith, for faith is the only 
thought pattern stronger than worry. 

To become a person of faith, 
practice changing worry thoughts to 
faith thoughts. Saturate your mind 
with the Bible, the greatest reservoir 
!of faith, and worry can be overcome. 

"Be careful for nothing; but in 
every thing by prayer and supplica- 
'ith thanksgiving let your 
oGod."

more tolerant of poor Spiro Agnew 
than others are. After all, Spiro only 
succumbed to the normal temptations

society. Now forget that people like 



make life for the rest of us as hard and 
costly as it is. Forget all that. Come 
down on the pot smokers and the 
nervous breakdowns ("there is no 
such thing!!") and be tolerant of 
Agnew. Surely Dr. Banks has to be 
kidding. 

But he isn't. And where is the 
dividing line between his jokes and his 
seriousness'' Is he just joking about 
giving intelligent people more votes 
than "morons"? I certainly hope so 
(what is the basis of democracy? Is 
Dr. Banks going to be the judge of 
intelligence and idiocy:), but I can't 
be sure. 

And how should we handle our 
problems? Merely put your thumb on 
the problem, he tells us, and you can 
cure it. Sure sounds easy. But there 
are problems in this society-alien- 
ation, lack of direction, how to change 
the system from within and without-

problem for Dr. Banks. Breakdown 
from overwork? Impossible. Only 
worry and fear cause breakdowns. 
(Maybe so, but are there than no 
limits to human endurance?) What 
about biological causes of mental 
disease? No way, says Dr. Banks. 
(We know, I presume, all there is to 
know about the human brain, so if we 
cannot now identify a biological 
cuase, none exists. And I thought we 
were always trying to learn what we 
didn't already know.) 

Now that Dr. Banks is ignorant or 
completely lacking in insight. His ten 
guides to mental health make sense to 
me, but his insistence on his own 
definitions of lack of adjustment and: 
his failure to realize sufficiently the 
fact that people have more than 
internal inadquacy to cope with, leave 
his prescription far short of helpful. 
And his attitudes are often abomin- 
able. On the one hand, he decently 
points out that alcoholics were once 
innocent babies and children, but in 
the same breath he strips away any 
human dignity they may still cling to 
when he describes them as "human 

Finally, to the James Gang 
(nothing personal, Dave), and to Dr. 
Lantz (to whom Dr. Banks attributes 
the idea for his coming here with the 
comment "If you like me, tell her; if 
you don't, keep your mouth shut"- 
very funny) I would like to express 
my indignation. Will we do better at 
future Convocations? I certainly hope

Doctor's Bag 



By ARNOLD WERNER. M. D. 

QUESTION: I tried to have sex twice with my boyfriend 
but he couldn't penetrate either time. I wasn't tense or 
nervous and it wasn't his fault. I think the problem must be 
physical and is mine. I wonder what a doctor would do to 
remedy the situ ition. 

ANSWER: Although most women do not have very much 
difficulty having intercourse the first time, some do have a 
tough hymen or a hymen with a very small opening which 
prevents adequate penetration. This is more unusual these 
days since so many women use tampons which do result in 
some stretching of the hymenal opening. Many sources 
state that strenuous physical activity by a woman can 
result in opening of the hymen. The hymen is in a rather 
sheltered spot and I have never been able to figure out what 
kind of physical activities they were talking about. It seems 
like something of a dubious proposition. 

A physician would perform a pelvic examination and 
determine by visual inspection whether the opening to the 
hymen was small. If it was only moderately small the 
physician could teach you how to dilate the hymenal 
opening using a special set of tubes of gradually increasing 
diameter. If the opening is very tight he might recommend 
a minor surgical procedure that could be done in the office. 
On the other hand, there is a chance that you are still 
struggling with basic anatomic confusion. You and your 
boyfriend should go back to scratch and begin with a more 
leisurely exploration of each other; the problem might 
solve itself. 



QUESTION: I recently developed a patchy type of rash on 
my back which spread around to the underpart of my 
breast. My doctor diagnosed the rash as shingles or herpes. 
What are the causes of such a viral infection and what does 
it involve? 

ANSWER: Shingles, (the technical name is herpes zoster) 
is a viral disease caused by an agent identical or nearly 
identical to the chickenpox virus. The area of infection 
follows the distribution of specific nerves involved in 
peripheral sensation. This explains why it is so clearly 
demarcated and runs from the back to the front of your 
body in a relatively narrow path on one side. 

Except when the infection involves the eye, in which 
case it is quite dangerous and needs special treatment, 
shingles pretty much gets better by itself. There are dozens 
of treatments, none of which are effective, and the person 
usually has to rely on aspirin or some other pain killer to 
keep comfortable. Applications of a mild lotion sometimes 
provide relief from the itching. Occasionally, following 
improvement of the infection, a person can be left with 
painful sensations in the nerve areas that were affected; 
fortunately this is not common. 



QUESTION: Can one cause damage to his body by 
"cracking his knuckles"? I am in the habit of cracking the 
joints in my fingers and wrists, neck, back, knees, toes and 
occasionally my hips. I have heard that this might lead to 



ANSWER: I immediately checked my Guiness Book of 
World Records and could find no entry under knuckles. I 
would advise you to apply for certificaton before you 
disarticulate yourself. Though unusual, I have seen people 
crack necks and backs but never the knees and toes and the 
visual image conjured up by the thought of someone 
cracking their hips resembles a grasshopper-type catapult 
across the room. You are dangerously toying with the very 
structure of your body and indeed may produce arthritis or 

The general run of the mill finger cracking has two 
current theories. One of them involves the slippage of 
tendons over bony prominences but the newer one states 
that with the distortion of the shape of the joint, a small 
amount of synovial fluid in the joint space vaporizes slightly 
and that results in the popping noise. Larger joint crackings 
are usually associated with the clear cut feeling of a tendon 
sliding over something. The tendons and ligaments as well 
as the bearing surfaces of joints were never made to endure 
these types of stresses repeatedly. topyn»M,im

For many Americans, forgetting the horrendous conflict in Southeast 
Asia has been easier than they ever thought possible. Mass f .„liln.al 
scandals domestic woes, and renewed hostilities in the pivotal Middle 
East have all more than effectively taken its place. National pride could 
hardlv be any lower. 

There are even spreading, persislent rumors thai Johnny Mann is a 
Communist. And the Bumsteads are said to be seriously contemplating a 
split to South America. What can happen next? 

Thank God there is still professional football. Americans can still 
relax in front of the tube every Sunday afternoon and watch the best 
professional athletes in action. Pro football is the best tension reliever 
known to man, outclassing Anacin by 20-1. 

Consequently, this writer can unlax and give some time to examing 
the first half of the 1973 NFL campaign; after all, the Option play is still 
there, and I'll take it. Thank God for 0. J. Simpson, Bobby Douglas, and 
Curt Gowdy. 

Before the season started, this writer predicted that the Viking I mm 
Minnesota would be a .500 club at best. The team defense was highly 
quest ionable because of age; on paper the offense was not. notable in any 
department. 

But the Vikes have been amazing so far this year under the tutelage Ol 
stone-faced Bud Grant. The defense has been near-perfect and I he offense 
behind Frank Tarkenton has been more than adequate. Minnesota is the 
only undefeated entry in the NFL and has emerged as an excellent Super 
Bowl contender. 

Another club which this writer land many other fans and writers) 
had written off before the regular season began is the Los Angeles Rams. 
The Gabriel-less Rams had a new coach, a new offense, and too many 
gaps to fill. The glory days were over. ...or so we said. 

Yet through the first half of this football year the revamped Rams 
have been outstanding. The offense has averaged nearly twice the total 
yards of many other teams. Only Minnesota has sent Los Angeles to 
defeat, and that was by one point. 

The Pittsburgh Sleelers thus far are proving thai 1972 was no fluke; 
they have been outscoring the opposition by better than 2 to 1 And injured 
Franco Harris is just now rounding into shape. 

The Washington Redskins (5-2) and the Dallas Cowboys (4-3) are 
again battling it out for the National Conference East Division title. Two 
weeks ago, though, both clubs were involved in upsets which, put 
together, must have had odds of a million to one. The lowly New Orleans 
Saints socked Washington 10-3, while the Philadelphia Eagles butchered 
Dallas, 30-14. 

The Cowboys are number one in offense this year. So why are they 
just 4-3? Schrewdly, we examine their famed defense and discover that it 
has been yielding an average of 20 points per game, well above its 
average from previous seasons. 

The Miami Dolphins have been beaten just once in outscoring the foe 
by b etter than 2 to 1 . Surprising Buffalo trails (he Super Bowl champions 
by just one game. The Bills' surge has been led by O. J. Simpson, who this 
season is at last establishing himself as a pro pigskin super -star. 

The Oakland Raiders benched Daryl Lamonica in favor of 
left-handed Ken Stabler after three regular season tilts. Stabler lit the 
Oakland offense and the team has not yet lost under him. 

The Raiders are getting competition from the much-improved 
Denver Broncos. Quarterback Charley Johnson and running back Floyd 
Little are leading the way for the Bronco offense, which is second best to 
Dallas thus far. But like the Cowboys, Denver has had defensive leaks, 
and consequently can show only a .500 mark. 

Hopefully the balance of the NFL season will be as exciting as the 
first half. Then everyone will be looking forward to the Super Bowl, not 
Dick Nixon's New Year's Day Resolution speech.

Smith, Stoneface tie for

The intramural flag football 
regular season came to a close with 
two teams still undefeated. In what 
was considered the game of the year, 
Smith and Stoneface, both previously 
unbeaten, played to a 6-6 tie. 

In other games Sundav, the Super 
Jocks dove past Circle K 6-0 while the

scored both of the touchdowns on long 
runs while Matt Richardson inter-

Boileau asset to Komets 



Three years ago Marc Boileau 
came to the Fort Wayne Komets to 
wind up his profesional hockey 
career. His performance as a player 
was exceptional, but the K's front 
office soon realized his potential as a 
coach. 

Boileau was seen as an excellent 
developer of talent, especially with 
young players. Consequently, two 
years ago general-manager Ken 
Ullyot asked Boileau to coach the 
Komets. No better decision could 
have been made. 

Last year Boileau took a squad of 
unknowns and molded it into a big 
winner. Fort Wayne swept the regular 
season title and the playoffs. 
Thisyear, though, many of the players 
on that championship squad have 
moved up to higher leagues. Thus 
Boileau has been faced with the same 
task all over again: developing a 
winner out of new talent. 

So far the 1973-74 Komets have 



been an impressive winner. If Boileau 
can once again produce a top IHL 
club, his coaching future will be very

THE UNPREDICTABLE NFL 

After eight weeks of National Football League action, it has become 
evident that this year is unlike those of the recent past. There once was a 
time when the preseason favorites would be leading their divisions by big 
margins and the weaker teams would already be "mathematically 
eliminated." 

This year it's a little different. Starting in the AFC, nobody figured that 
the Buffalo Bills would have the fourth best record in the conference. 
None of the "experts" would have bet that Kansas City and Cleveland 
would be currently struggling with a 4-3-1 mark. 

In the NFC, last year's West division champs, San Francisco, is 
currently tied for last place. The revived Los Angeles Rams won their 
first six games but dropped their last two--to Minnesota and Atlanta. 

The NFC Central divison is the wildest. The Minnesota Vikings have 
already won more games this year than last and are the only team 
currently undefeated. The preseason favorites, the Packers, are riding 
along in last place. Three out of the four teams in this division sport 
losing records. 

The East has the New York Giants posting a 1-6-1 clip which isnt even 
close to last year's mark of 8-6. Again three of the five teams fail to reach 
the .500 mark. 

If the season continues on its present course, watch out for an 
underdog team to win the Super Bowl—but don't bet on it. 

THE PREDICTABLE NBA 

On the opposite end of the field, or court, there is the National 
Basketball Association. Where as the NFL is unpredictable, the NBA 
game outcomes are easily diagnosed. 

In the Atlantic division, the Boston Celtics are leading the New York 
Knicks by only one game. Remember that the top two teams in each 
division make the playoffs so the order of finish doesn't matter too much. 

The Central division leaders are the same of years past with just a 
reversal of order. The Atlanta Hawks and the perennial favorites, the 
Capitol Bullets, are 1-2 while Cleveland and Houston are lagging behind. 

The Jabbar-led Milwaukee Bucks are sporting a 11-1 record and last 
year's number two team, the Chicago Bulls, are only a game down at 10-2. 

The Los Angeles Lakers, even without Wilt the Stilt, are currently 
leading the Pacific division although the Portland Trailblazers are only 
one down (but will probably end up out of the playoffs). 

Until some of the weaker teams get stronger, the NBA playoffs will 
probably have the same teams which participated for the last three
