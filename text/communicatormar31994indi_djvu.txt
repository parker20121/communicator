Minority representatives absent in 
Chancellor's Search Committee 



by Ramona McGown 

Editor in chief 

and Jo Ann Stelnforth 

News Editor 

The search for a new chancellor 
continues. What began last Fall has 
now progressed to the point pre- 
dicted by Walter P. Helmke, chair 
of the Fort Wayne Chancellor 
Selection Advisory Committee. 

Helmke, who also serves on the 
Community Advisory Committee, 
reported to the Faculty Convocation 
last Monday what progress had 
been made in the search for a new 
chancellor to replace Joanne B. 
Lantz. 

Hclmke attended the meeting to 
answer questions on the where the 
committee was in the selection 
process. 

Rebecca A. Teagarden, is vice 
chair of the Community Advisory 
Council. 

"There had been a total of 62 
applications submitted which had 
been narrowed down to seven 
applications," said Helmke. 

Phone interviews will then be 
conducted with the seven appli- 
cants. 

"Out of these seven applicants, 
three or four will be invited to the 
campus, hopefully by the end of 
March," said Helmke. 

There are two dates remaining for 
the faculty convocations to meet; 
March Hand April 11. 

Recommendations of the three 
names will be submitted in early 
April to Purdue President Steven 
Beering. Beering will make the 
final decision. 

The next step in the process will 
be to bring the three candidates on 
campus to an open meeting with the 
campus community. 

According to Hclmke. the selec- 
tion committee is looking for a 
competent, qualified and diverse 
candidate to be the new chancellor 

Yet there are no minorities repre- 
sented on the search committee to 
help in the selection process, 

Purdue President Steven Beering

said lo The Communicator that 
there was a minority represented on 
the search committee, but that the 
person was absent from die meet- 
ings and was then removed. 

When Beering could not identify 
the minority representative, The 
Communicator then contacted 
Hclmke and die representative was 
identified as former student body 
president Rajat Suri. 

Jerry Richardson, the present stu- 
dent body president, was then 
added to the committee to replace 
Suri. 

Other committee members 
appointed by Beering last Fall (as 
reported in The Communicator) 
are: Scott F. Argast, associate pro- 
fessor of geology an chair of 
GcoScienccs; John P. Bell, associ- 
ate professor of history; L. Dianne 
Bezdon, business administrator. 



School of Engineering and 
Technology; Sandra S Bryant, for- 
mer secretary, Office of the Dean of 
Students; Ronald C. Emery, profes- 
sor and chair, Department of 
Electrical Engineering Technology; 
Thomas L. Guthrie, associate pro- 
fessor of Economics and director, 
Community Research Institute; 
Linda M. Hitc, assistant professor 
of Organizational Leadership and 
Supervision; Frank V. Palatino, 
professor and chair of Biology, and 
Jerry Richardson, IPFW student 
body president. 

"The candidate must also have a 
strong academic and administrative 
background to lead IPFW into the 
next century," said Helmke. 

The candidate must also possess 
an understanding of leadership of a 
non-traditional campus body, with 
urban and muld-cullural interests. 



Women's History highlights WWII figure 



By JoAnnSteinforth 
News Editor 

If you pick up this month's issue 
of Smithsonian Magazine, you will 
find "Rosie the Riveter", a popular 
women's historical figure featured 
on die front cover. 

"Rosie the Riveter" is featured on 
the front cover of this month's 
Smithsonian Magazine. 

"Rosie the Riveter" portrayed the 
typical female worker during World 
War II when many thousands of 
women stepped into the labor force 
when men were called off to war, 
leaving jobs available. 

An award featuring "Rosie" will 
be one of die highlights on campus 
during the month of March on 
behalf of Women's History Month. 

This year's theme "In every gen- 
eration, action frees our dreams," 
was taken from die front cover of a 
catalog of posters featuring women. 

"The "Rosie Award" is a cam- 
paign to nominate one outstanding 
female student and one outstanding 
female faculty member from 
IPFW," said Lois Ketterer, secre- 
tary of the Center for Women and 
Returning Adults. 

The main focus of this campaign 
is to bring awareness lo the campus 
that March is Women's History 
Month," said Ketterer. 

The Indiana Purdue Student 
Government Association and the 
Womens Center will help in the 
selection process to determine die 



wrnner. 

Voting for the two winners will 
take continue until the March 18 
deadline, and presentation of the 
Rosie Award winners will take 
place at the IPSGA Leadership 
Banquet on April 18. 

Nomination forms are available at 
the Ketder Information Booth or at 
the IPSGA office, located in Walb 
Memorial Union. Room 225. 

The center is also sponsoring a 
Poster Information Program with 
displays in Kettler and Classroom 
Medical. 

There will also be other displays 



around campus focusing on 20 
quotes from various women," said 
Ketterer. 

Featured comments include Anne 
Frank's quotation, "Parents can 
only give good advice or put them 
on the right paths, but the final 
forming of a person's character lies 
in their own hands." 

Ketterer stated another of the 
Center's contribution to women's 
history month was their presenta- 
tion last October of Musica Femina. 
Tuning of this event could not coin- 
cide with March's Women's 
History Month.

Opinion 



The Communicator 



Thursday March I 1994 



STAFF EDITORIAL 

Underground paper 
shows lack of courage 

This semester we are unfortunately exposed to an 
underground newspaper called the Dumbunicator 
which is distributed all around campus. Well, those of 
you who have taken part in such an uninformative as 
well as gutless and abominable piece of writing, we at 
The Communicator have a few questions for you. 

Why is it that you do not take credit for something 
that you obviously feel proud of? We are talking about 
putting your own bylines in your paper. Perhaps you 
are afraid of publicly taking credit for the material that 
you produced? 

Also, why is it that your staff has not come up with 
its own layout? It appears that you have even used 
some of our clip-art. Come on guys, can we not be 
more original. I guess putting down your student 
newspaper is much easier than taking part in it. 

Why is it that you do not have any information for 
the students that you feel is important? Could it be that 
you are better at degrading this paper than at coming 
up with issues of your own? 

Obviously the racial issues and the unfortunate facts 
about the founding fathers are apparently too shocking 
for your staff to comprehend and deal with effectively. 

The Dumbunicator once again expresses in a public 
forum the covert, racist attitudes that exist throughout 
the university system and student body. 

Instead of hiding under white hoods, you choose to 
cowardly write a newspaper without any bylines. 
The comparison is quite remarkable and frightening. 




Correction : 

In the February 24 issue of The Communicator, Michael Wartell. 
vice chancellor of academic affairs, was misidentified as the person 
who confirmed that Abe Bassett, professor of theatre, has retired due 
to health reasons. This information was obtained from Gerald Ratliff 
dean of the school of fine and performing arts. 



Comment of the week: 

"It always seemed to me that white people were 
judged as individual. But if a Negro did some- 
thing stupid or wrong, it was held against all of 
us. Negroes were always representing the whole 
race."

Letters to the editor 



Editorial staff described as self-righteous 



To Ihe Editor: 

Upon reading Ramona Mcgown's 
front page article. "Chair of Music 
Department, Professor of Theatre 
Department submit resignations" 
(The Communicator, Feb. 24), I 
would like to commend (he editor 
in chief for writing just the article I 
was expecting, although certainly 
not the article I was hoping. From 
the moment on Feb. 18 that Dr. 
Taylor announced lo the Music 
Department student body that he 
was stepping down from the posi- 
tion of chairman, I expected The 
Communicator to at least attempt to 
link his action to the court case in 
Tennessee, if not to claim victory 
due its own "hard-hitting investiga- 
tive reporting" of last fall. Alas, my 
hope that The Communicator 
would meet the high standards of 
objective journalism were for 
naught. It should be noted that the 
staff of Ihe Communicator did 
finally get some of its facts straight 
in referring lo the pending litigation 
as concerning "sexual discrimina- 
tion," as opposed to the consider- 



ably more inflammatory "sexual 
harassment" it erroneously reported 
last Fall, yet it still conveniently 
neglected to mention that Dr. 
Taylor is only one of the more than 
a dozen defendants named in the 
suit. I believe the editorial staff is 
once again guilty of taking any 
opportunity to advance its own 
agenda regardless of whether it is 
even germane to the discussion. 

Admittedly, the article never 
directly slates that there is a con- 
nection between the pending litiga- 
tion and Dr. Taylor's decision to 
step down. However, since fully 
one-third of the article (and nearly 
60 percent of the text thai refers to 
Dr. Taylor) is devoted to this sub- 
ject, the reader is left with no 
choice hut to conclude that at least 
the editor in chief believes there is a 
connection. There is no evidence lo 
suggest that Dr. Taylor made his 
decision based on anything other 
than "personal and professional rea- 
sons" related to the present. 
Certainly, he knew that the case in 
Tennessee was pending when he 
accepted the position at IPFW, so it 



docs not stand to reason that he 
would now suddenly decide, to step 
down for (hat cause. I do not 
believe The Communicator should 
take it upon itself to imply a con- 
nection thai it has no proof exists, 
although I certainly do not feel that 
this is the first lime ihc editorial 
staff has attempted to do so, (i.e. 
once again the many derogatory 
articles concerning Dr. Taylor lasi 
fall.) 

The loss of such a gifted adminis- 
trator as Dr. Taylor in the position 
of department chairman will cer- 
tainly be fell - in the Music 
Department. However, by remain- 
ing at IPFW as a lenured professor 
of music, Dr. Taylor will have the 
opportunity to directly influence the 
lives of more students through 
leaching. I find his personal com- 
mitment to quality and to the Music 
Art to be very inspirational. I am 
very happy that now more students 
will be learning from Dr. Taylor, 
the master educator, although I will 
miss Dr. Taylor, the effective 
administrator. 

These last remarks were included 



because I feel (hat much better use 
of the primed page could have been 
made by the editor in chief. As it 
was, in an article thai supposedly 
dealt with currcnl events, onc-lhird 
of the article (as I noted above) 
was merely regurgitating immateri- 
al information about events lhal are 
being property handled by the court 
system of Tennessee, not by The 
Communicator. I also find il inter- 
esting that I cannot remember once 
that The Communicalor, of it's own 
initiative, reported the opinion of 
music students toward Dr. Taylor, 
as I suspect it would do much to 
undermine the self-righteous stance 
of an editorial staff lhal has 
appointed itself judge and jury. 
Though I have become rather dis- 
couraged after reading Ihe editorials 
of The Communicalor over ihc past 
several months, I still harbor a faint 
glimmer of hope that in Ihe future 
The Communicator will make a 
greater effort to be a collegiate 
newspaper lhal is exemplary of true 
journalism.

Columns show poor writing and disrespect 



To the editor: 

I would like to take this opportu- 
nity to comment on some of the 
anicles, specifically the editorials, 
that The Communicator has recent- 
ly published. 1 hope that my com- 
ments will be taken as constructive 
criticism and not be interpreted as 
personal defamation of character. 

I have noticed a certain trend in 
Ihe writing slyles of F. Lane Douse 
and Ramona Mcgown. Lately, it 
seems as though these writers are 
more concerned with belittling 
those with opposing viewpoints and 
less concerned with ihe issues that 
they present. More importantly, I 
feel that these two writers have 
failed to successfully inform read- 
ers by concentrating on who their 
next and newest victim will be. 

More specifically, I would like to 



address McGown's choice of 
vocabulary in her commentary, 
"StudenLs need to wake up." in the 
Feb. 24 issue of The 
Communicator. I feel thai her con- 
tinuous use of vulgar language 
throughout noi only offends many 
readers but also diminishes her 
credibility as a writer. Throughout 
the entire paper it was clear that 
McGown felt she could not effec- 
tively express her views without the 
use of profanity. I feel that this kind 
of language is inappropriate for a 
college publication or any other 
publication. 

Secondly, I thought thai Douse's 
reply to Larry Gwaltney in the 
Feb.17 issue lacked style and con- 
sideration. In his article he person- 
ally attacks and blames Larry 
Gwaltney for his own trials and 
tribulations. I found his writing 



capabilities questionable and his 
reference to the Bible perplexing. 
Douse's behavior, accusations, and 
writing techniques seem anything 
but divine in the image of Jesus 
Christ. 

Finally, I would like to question 
the significance, if any, of Ihe col- 
umn. "You didn't hear it from me, 

but " written by Douse. 

Originally, 1 think this column was 
intended to be a "short and sweet" 
brain -picking session with Douse. I 
would have lo agree il was a clever 
idea. However, he has abused the 
privilege of wriu'ng this column by 
using it as a line of communication 
to anyone and everyone who has 
upset him. I do not see any value in 
Douse referring to his personal 
experiences which are entirely 
unrelated (o the readers. What, if 
anything, do the readers stand to 



gain from this kind of column? The 
column also repeatedly displays 
poor writing style and overall disre- 
spect 

1 will get to my point. As a stu- 
dent of IPFW I fee) 1 have a right to 
question the content of a newspaper 
which represents me and my 
school. From now on, can I as a 
reader obtain useful information 
without all Ihe garbage? Will you 
as editors debate an issue without 
attacking Ihe mentality and integri- 
ty of each individual on the oppos- 
ing side? Are you able to voice 
your opinion without constantly 
cursing and insulting others' intelli- 
gence? If you want fairness, leam 
how to play fair. If you want your 
opinion valued, value others' opin- 
ions. If you want to be respected as 
a writer, write respectfully.

Student concerned with homophobia 



To the Editor, 

I want to address an issue thai has 
been absent in The Communicator 
for some time, homophobia. For 
those reading who do not know 
what homophobia is. let me give 
you an example. 

Last Thursday. I was wailing for 
my 10:30 am. English class in ihe 
CM building. The television was 
tuned to "The Bertice Jesse 
Do no hue Show" and the subject of 
the hour was the Gay Games. For 



all who are unkowing. the Gay 
Games arc an Olympic -style sport- 
ing event that showcases the athlet- 
ic talents of gay men and lesbians. 
The events range from gymnastics 
to track to swimming and every- 
thing in between. For the gay com- 
munity, the games are a time for 
celebration but are taken very 
seriously 

The usual crowd that sil around 
ihe TV at this time were making 
pole-vaulting and pammel-horse 
jokes, jokes that I have made 



myself and found to be very funny. 
Bui no one at this little gathering 
could believe that such an activity 
could exist. So I. who never had 
been a pan of this group, thought 
that this was my chance lo meet 
people and possibly make new 
friends. I went over lo the group 
and asked if I could answer any 
quesiions about the games. The 
entire room drew to a silence. It 
was as if I had ruined their fun and 
they couldn't make these or any 
other gay jokes anymore. No one 



would even look at me. I was in 
awe! I didn't give a big speech 
about how gays want respect and 
equal rights. I just wanted to join 
their conversation as an authority. 

This is just an observation. I do 
not offer any solutions or want any 
apologies for anything., there are 
none to make. I only wanted to note 
this blatant display homophobia in 
action.

A Dose of Douse 

Society needs to open their minds 



ReccnUy Roseanne Barr probably 
won the hearts of homosexuals by 
defending her popular ABC scries 
which aired a "controversial" 
episode on Tuesday. 

This controversial episode con- 
tained a scene in which Roseanne 
exchanges a kiss with another 
woman in a gay bar. 

The episode was to be canceled 
by ABC executives because it did 
not "represent the lifestyle that 
most people lead." Well, only 10 
percent of the United States popula- 
tion is homosexual, so that does 
cover some folk, don't you think? 

In the March 1 issue of the 
Journal Gazette. Roseanne gave an 
interview to Boston Globe Reporter 
Joseph P Kahn explaining the issue 
at hand. 

She slates, "According to the big 
lawyer at ABC. Nobody in the real 
world ever questions their own sex- 
uality past the age of 14, Of course, 
we all know that's true. No one is 
threatened by anyone else's. And 
that is why it's such a wonderful 
world we live in. These are the peo- 
ple who have the final say over 
what goes on television." 

I submit that if people don't ques- 
tion their sexuality past the age of 
14, than why aren't there more gay- 
oriented television shows on televi- 
sion besides Melrose Place which is 
quite homophobic. The last gay sto- 
ryline, they head dealt with gays in 
the military. Boy is that a new 

I think what the big problem is 
that Hollywood is finally going to 
have to come to terms with their 
homophobia starting with the death 
of Rock Hudson from AIDS, Now, 
they have Philadelphia which is an 



excellent movie but, why did they 
wait so long? 

As far as my memory takes me, 
the first lime I remember seeing an 
openly gay character was on cither 
Soap or Dynasty. 1 don't remember 
which one was on television first 
but Ihc issue was addressed. 
However, the characters were not 
portrayed in a positive manner, 
especially Steven Carrington on 
Dynasty. Why how many lovers 
did Ihc boy go through because 
they were always dying or leaving? 
The producers finally settled 
Steven down with some guy in ihc 
last movie. 

Other than that show ihe only 
time you would sec any type of 
television drama with some type of 
gay-theme was on the paid chan- 
nels. I'm talking about Cincmax. 
Showiime, and of course, Home 
Box Office. 

I think Showtime took the first 
step by airing. Brothers. 
Brothers was an award winning 
comedy that covered the day lo day 
lives of iwo brothers, an ex-football 
jock and a gay cook. 

HBO followed in Showiime's 
place by airing Tidy Endings. Tidy 
Endings was a movie starring 
Stockard Channing and Harvey 
Fircslcin, Ihe ex-wife and lover 
who have lo come to terms with a 
man's death lo AIDS. Once again. 
we see the AIDS theme. 

The nexl thing you know we have 
all of ihcse other movies popping 
up ranging from Parting Glances to 
Longtime Companion lo Paris is 
Burning. 

Of course after Longtime 
Companion won critical acclaim 
but limited play (he networks began

lo look al the subject of homosexu- 
ality but only with AIDS issues 
linked io it. 

Take the movie "Our Two Sons" 
starring Julie Andrews and Ann- 
Margaret This Was a movie about 
two mothers who had to deal with 
iheir sons, one of ihcm, of course, 
was dying from guess what? 
AIDS. 

Of course, ABC also showed a 
scene in which two men were lying 
in bed together in the once popular 
now on Lifetime as re-runs drama, 
Thin ysome thing. This show began 
lo porlray homosexual men in a 
positive manner by even establish- 
ing a reoccurring gay man. But, 
wasn't there some big time discus- 
sion about not showing the episode 
anymore because advertisers didn't 
want to be associated with homo- 
sexuality. 

What people fail to realize is thai 
by not allowing people lo sec 
homosexuals in a natural positive 
setting will only conlinue lo rein- 
force the negative stereotypes of 
gay people being abnormal, 
promiscuous, different, living in 
sin, and having no morals or val- 
ues. 

Of course, there will be Bible 
beaters who will disagree, but there 
is no place where ii is said that lov- 
ing another man is a sin. It docs 
say lying with another man is a sin, 
but that passage was referring to 
any acts of aggression such as rap- 
ing or prostitution. Now, we can 
argue all of that oui until we are 
blue in the face. Bui you have lo 
agree on ihe first point. 




Thai's what I am talking about. 
People nowadays are loo wrapped 
up in ihcir religions and close- 
minded viewpoints to really have a 
good sense of whai is actually 
going on. People have allowed 
other people to determine what is 
morally righl and wrong instead of 
actually determining thai for them- 
selves. 

I think if people would stop and 
ask homosexuals, did they choose 
to be that gay ihcy would have an 
interesting answer for them. Would 
anyone choose to be under constant 
criticism, blamed for a disease lhat 
has infected both sexually aciive 
groups, nol allowed the same 
rights, and always labeled as a 
"sinner" because some man, not 
God, has said lhat it was wrong. 

Homosexuals arc humans who 
deserve ihe unalienated rights lo be 
Ircalcd as such, like humans,

Aunt Louise encourages inter-racial dating 




Dear Aunt LouLie, 

I have a big lime problem, Aunt 
Louise. My best friend has lost her 
mind. She is going out with Ibis 
guy who doesn't care about her 
whatsoever. She is so in love with 
him. 

] have tried and tried and tried to 
convince her that he just doesn't 
want her. He just wants her for sex 
and she won't listen. 

What should I do? 

Sincerely, 

Standing and Watching My 

Friend Self-Destruct 



Dear Standing and Watching, 

Sugar, what you need to do is just 
sit back and let your best friend go. 
She will only Icam when he has 
treated her as less than a woman. 



Why my cousin Earline had a bad 
habit of picking up mean who con- 
■■ urn i ■, disrespected her as a person. 
Well, she married a snake like that. 
Child, be had so many affairs and 
she never knew. Well, either she 
knew and she just didn't want to 
admit to it. He even tried to put the 
moves on me, as you young folks 
would say. Well, my ol' porkchop 
Dorcm put an end to that. 

I tried to tell her. I said. "Earlic, 
he don't iove you. Honey, wc ail 
know what he loves." 

But she didn't believe me until 
one day a man shot bim dead. This 
man had found him in bed with bis 
wife. Why he didn't even have a 
chance to buckle up his pants! 

So, sugar dumpling, you need to 
let her learn by experience. When 
things go wrong, just make sure 
you are there to support her. 

Yuur loving Aunt Louise 

Dear Aunt Louise, 

I just met a really nice girl. She's 
nice and sweet. She has morals and 
values. Wc have a good lime when 
we are out together. The only prob- 
lem is that she is black and I am 
while. 

I wouldn't mind going out with 
her on a regular basis. I'm just 
afraid of how my friends would 
react if I was in a relationship with 
her 



What should I do? 

Sincerely, 
Color Blind or Not 

Dear Color Blind or Not, 

Number one. son. let explain 
something to you. Now, your Aunt 
Louise may be old but 1 am very 
knowledgeable. You are not color 
blind. You need to be color con- 
scious and recognize her color as 
so. 

I can't believe that you would 
allow your friends lo prevent you 
from being happy, When I was 
coming up there were very few 
couples with blacks and whites 
because of the condition of folk's 
minds back then. 

Of course, my parents raised us 
with a strong set of morals and val- 
ues. They told us to accept every- 
one because that's the way the good 
Lord wants it to be. 

So. I'm telling you that if you 
really like this gal, you need to go 
out with her. Her color does matter 
and needs to be respected just like 
your while skin. 

If you really like her, I suggest 
you push your friends aside and 
address your feelings for what they 
arc. I think you should go out with 
this young lady because she has a 
lol to offer you. 

Your loving Aunt Louise

SUBWAY RIVIERA 



3 RIVIERA PLAZA 



by F. Lane Douse, 
Features Editor 

Vou didn't hear it from me. but I 
may have been the fool last week. 
You know, I'm human and I do 
make mistakes. But I am by no 
means anyone's fool. So. this week 
I will clarify what happened. 

Last week. I saw and read the 
Dumbunicator, a racist parody of 
the Communicator. After reading 
the underground newspaper. I 
played a lot of games mentally try- 
ing lo figure out who would write 
this piece of trash. 

Now, I do not know who wrote 
it, bui I do know who is distribut- 
ing it. 

According 10 Jeff Brunson, who I 
consider to be a reliable source, 
our favorite, infamous, former edi- 
tor in chief and current IPSGA sen- 
ator Jim Walker is the person 
handing out the paper. As a matter 
of fact, Jeff told me, in front of two 
other people, that Jim gave him a 
copy! 

Being a proficient reporter. The 
Communicator contacted Jim 
Walker on this issue. Walker said, 
"I have no comment." 

Now, if I were an IPSGA sena- 
tor, I would be disgusted by a fel- 
low senator's involvement in hand- 
ing out a racist rag. Why, I think an 
impeachment would be necessary! 

According 10 the Constitution of 
the Student Government 
Association, grounds for impeach- 
ment can be for violating the 
University's Code of Conduct and 
Student Rights and Responsibil- 



ities (for those who want 10 check, 
lumtopage 15). 

Now. the 1993-94 Student 
Handbook states thai IPFW stu- 
dents have Ihc right to not be dis- 
criminated against or harassed on 
this campus. 

Whereas Jim has not done any of 
these things publically. I wonder 
why he is handing out an under- 
ground publication that clearly dis- 
criminates on the basis of race? 

I would look into it. if I were on 
the Internal Affairs Committee. 

The thing that makes me laugh 
the most is that whoever wrote it 
doesn't even have the balls to 
assign a name to it. This only 
shows that the individuals are cow- 
ards and lack in character. Of 
course, if someone is a racist what 
else would you expect? 

And by the way look whose 
laughing now! 1 ain't never been 
one to lose a pissin' match with a 
skunk. 

The other thing I feel the need lo 
comment on is how all of these 
students like to comment on the 
content of the paper or the writing 
styles of the writers. 

Number one: I think most people 
know that this column is one in 
which I like to have fun and enter- 
tain people. I think wc have a good 
time with some of the gossip and 
such that goes on. Whereas my 
other column, "A Dose of Douse" 
tends to deal with the serious 
issues. 

Number two: I have heard people 
say thai the content of the paper 



consisu ol just "people who are 
whining about their situation." 

Well, I have a message for that 
person who made those comments 
and people who think like them. If 
your people were brought over 
here against their will, treated 
inhumanly, raped. Christianized, 
and siripped of all personal self 
value- you would be hollering loo. 

See what you people need to 
realize is that the only lime you gel 
upset is when people of color do 
not stay in their so-called place. 
The same goes with any other 
group that is discriminated against. 

Let me explain something to you, 
I define myself and where 1 want 
lobe. 

This is your siudeni newspaper. 
It is also my student newspaper 
and I participate in ii. If you warn 
your views heard, why don't you 
just join the staff and write a col- 
umn or cover a campus event 
instead leaving ignorant statements 
on the answering machine. It is so 
much easier to criticize than it is lo 
help. 

And for all of you racist folks oul 
there, think about (his: 

There is no shame in being a 
stave (or having ancestors who 
were slaves). Tlie shame is in being 
a slave owner(or having ancestors 
who were slave owner). 

This last comment is for my fan 
club members, writers and distrib- 
utors of the Dumbunicator, Kiss, 
Kiss boys!
