THE COMMUNICATOR 



Dear Students, 

Welcome to all of those students attending IPFW for the first 
time this semester and welcome back to all of you who are 
returning from last semester. 

Throughout the year we in Students' Government are aware 
that many students have no idea of what we do for you or if, in 
fact, we do anything or accomplish anything at all. 

At this midway point in our year I would like to re-cap for you 
some of the many things that your Students' Government has 
accomplished or provided for you thus far this year: 

Picnic tables in Aquarius Park. 

Microwave oven in the library lounge. 

Extended cafeteria hours beginning this month. 

A discount meal ticket plan at The Fort . 

Replaced or up-graded T.V.s in all lounges. 

A Student Directory coming this semester. 

A Freshman Yearbook coming this year. 

Topical speakers coming to this campus soon. 

Presenting a new theater play this spring. 

Provided TV. and VCR for the Art School. 

Initiated a short-term Student Emergency Loan Plan. 

A Students' Government News Letter beginning soon. 

An activity calendar. 

A 40% increase in student representation of faculty and 

university governing committees. 

Provided funding for student programs on Channel 6. 

Provided televised Students' Government meetings. 

Held an "issues rally" for students to bring their concerns and 

complaints to their Senators. 

Provided funding for several Student Organizations. 

Provided funding for Confluence , a literary magazine. 

In addition to those accomplishments, your Students' 
Government and/or its members have addressed topical issues 
on this campus or of concern to students as: 

- "Safe sex" and womyn's reproductive rights. 

- University divestment in South Africa. 

- The parking situation on this campus. 

- "Free speech" and "students rights" issues. 

- Smokers and non-smokers rights in regard to the university's 
Smoking Policy. 

- Minority recruitment and minority issues. 

- International student issues. 

- Child care consortium problems. 

- Safety on campus (prompting the formation of a university 
committee to study this issue). 

- Enacted a Senate Resolution in support of the establishment 
of a Womyn's Study Major. 

- Returning Adult Student issues and problems. 

- Increased student study/lounge space. 

So you see, your Students' Government has been working for 
you this past semester, and the year is not yet over! Some of the 




things you can still look for this year are: 

- A 24-hour Student Union. 

- A re-decorated cafeteria. 

- Free Legal Aid service for students. 

- The establishment of a health clinic on campus. 

- Alternatives to Follett's Bookstore. 

- A new "smokeless" study lounge in Walb Union. 

- "Voters Registration Week" on campus. 

- Earth Day Festivities and Events. 

- Provide for the sale of condoms on the campus. 

- Elimination of styrofoam use on campus. 

- Outside pay telephones around campus. 

- "Emergency Phones" in the parking lots. 

- Student representation on Faculty Hiring and Tenure 
Committee. 

- Ashtrays for indoor and outdoor smoking areas. 

The list could go on but I think you have the idea that we, in 
Students' Government, are far from being through this year. 

Finally, I want to personally thank all of those students, faculty, 
administrators, and staff members who have helped in our 
accomplishments and successes so far. Without everyone's help 
we could not have succeeded to the extent that we have. This 
does not mean that we do not still need your help. There are 
many openings in Students' Government from seats on the 
Senate to Presidential Assistants and committee appointments. If 
you would like to be a part of the excitement which comes 
through an active involvement in your university and are not 
afraid of controversy or speaking your mind, please contact 
either myself at 481-6588, or any member of Students' 
Government at 481-6586. We need your help. There is still much 
to be accomplished.
