Shortening the distance 

Students violate handicap spaces 



Photo By S*i. Valdiunt. Ptolo Eoitoi 

IPFW sludents Denise Rohrer and Mark Miller were successful in 
finding an available handicap parking space for Rohrer's car. 



by Dawn Snarr 
News Editor 

The parking loi is covered in 
snow; ihe sidewalks are covered in 
ice and temperatures drop below 
zero. 

For these reasons, several slu- 
denis have shortened their disiance 
from the parking loi to their classes, 
by parking in (he handicap 
parking spaces. 

"Last semester I confronted a 
loi of people in the parking lot," 
said handicap permit holder Bruce 
Lake, sophomore, human services. 
"Everyday I would see ihc same 
people parking in Ihe handicap 
spaces and then book into 
Neff for class- 
Under the Fon Wayne Code of 
Ordinance, Section 5, no person 
shall stop, stand or park a vehicle in 
a space indicated for disabled citi- 
zens, unless thai person has a 
license plate or decal issued from 
the Bureau of Moior Vehicles 
Commission. 

This statement, or the expense 
of a ticket, has not seemed to stop 



many students from parking in the 
reserved spaces on campus 

According to the campus 
police, students are required to 



statement for 




the need of a 




special permit 




Those who have | 




obvious 




injuries do 




not need a 




doctor's 




note. 




everyone 
should show

proof from the

some try to fake injuries," said 
Lake. "1 also think thai the lags 
should be checked for expiration 
dates, and basic abuse." 

For six weeks, a temporary 
handicap permit can be issued and 
used on campus, even without hav- 
ing a city or slate permit Many peo- 
ple who borrow and share their fam- 
ily member's cars lake advantage of 
Ihe "blue tag" in the window 



"The availability of handicap 
parking is a civil law." said Randall 
Borst, director of services for stu- 
dents with disabilities "When 
someone lakes that away from 
another person ii is illegal " 

According to Tom Haner. IPFW 
police lieutenant, the campus police 
do ticket those without a tag. 
Officers then enforce displayed 
tags, and check dates on temporary 
permits Police have ihe right to ask 
parking patrons the reason why they 
are parking the designated spots if it 
is not obvious. 

Everyone on campus does have 
the freedom to voice complaints to 
the department of disabled sludents 
or campus police Both departments 
check inio complaints, and abusers 
can be caught. 

"There are 73 spaces labeled 
handicap parking spaces," said 
Haner "This is double ihe amount 
thai we are legally required to sup- 
ply." 

"On any given day I have seen 
every handicap space filled, with 
the same people, who are running 
from their car io class," said Lake 



"I just don't think it possible Ihal 
there arc thai many handicap stu- 
dents on campus all the time " 

When handicap parking spaces 
arc full, "A" lots usually reserved 
for faculty and staff, are allowed for 
use by those with the proper lags 

in the fall, the new science 
building will add more parking 
spaces for handicapped patrons. 
Along wilh that lot will come a 
parking garage in ihe Gates parking 
lot, adding even more handicap 
parking lo ihe north side of campus. 

Handicap accessible parking is 
designated for people who need it 
and have laken the sieps to gel prop- 
er parking approval. Lake said 
amputee's use 300 perceni more 
energy per day than most sludents. 

"It makes me wonder what is 
happening to common courtesy 
when an individual will take a spec- 
ified space," said Lake " Where has 
the compassion and consideration 
gone for our fellow person." 

Students interested in more 
information about the problems 
may call the campus police, 
at 481-6827. 



Night owls welcome 
new nest in library 



Witnessing the dream 



by Natalie Hess 
Chief Reporter 

E-mail access will soon be avail- 
able 24 hours as soon as Indiana- 
Purdue Student Government 
Association (1PSGA) members 
receive the equipment they need to 
make it possible. 

Mary Schoeler, manager of user 
support in computer and data pro- 
cessing services, said thai the cam- 
pus will begin seeing freestanding 
labs (bat offer quick e-mail access to 
studenis as soon as April 1 . 

"We were given a shipment date 
of March 14 for the kiosks," said 
Schoeler. 

George Gounaris, IPSGA presi- 
dent, said he hopes the computers 
will be installed as soon as the furni- 
ture arrives 

The kiosks are designed for the 
computer monitor to rest at waist 
level so that it faces upward. People 
standing in line behind the user will 
not be able to read the monitor. 

Schoeler said another conve- 
nience of ihese terminals is because 
they operate through DOS, sludents 
will not need a disk nor will they 
nave to use a mouse. 

According to Schoeler. there will 
be 20 locations around campus 
equipped wilh these e-mail terminals 
by the end of the semester. And at 
each location, there will be one ter- 
minal that sits lower, for disability 
access. 

Made possible by the student 
technology fee implemented in the 
fall of 1995, uie addition of e-mail to 



(he computer labs one and a half 
years ago has since led to an over- 
crowding in ihese labs. 

After being elected. Gounaris 
and Chris Douse, IPSGA vice-presi- 
dent, began investigating the possi- 
bility of having 24-hour computer 
access after hearing student com- 
plaints about the limited hours of 
computer availability and limited 
hours to do research in the 
Helmke library. 

"If people don't gel off work 
until 10 p m and can't get to the 
library until 10:30 p.m., they aren't 
left with enough time to research," 
said Gounaris. 

Due to this factor, the four termi- 
nals that are to be installed in the 
Helmke 24-hour lounge will have 
library research capability as well as 
e-mail access. 

"Right now, our lop priority is 
gelling the four terminals set up in 
die library lounge, because (hat is 
open 24 hours unlike any of the 
buildings around campus," said 
Schoeler. 

After IPSGA equips Helmke, 
plans are to install three terminals in 
the vending area of Neff Hall lounge 
and three against the northeast wall 
of the Engineering-Technology 
lobby. Walb Union. Kettler Hall, the 
Fine Arts Building and Classroom 
Medical are also being considered to 
house these terminals. 

"Many faculty recommended 
removing the TV from the lobby of

Honors program: more than study 



by Natalie Hess 
Chief Reporter 

Perhaps it is bcsl slated by Malt 
Kubik, director of (he honors pro- 
gram, when he says we need "com- 
munity, community, communily on a 
campus wi(h little." 

The schedule of events set forth 
by (he honors program places 
emphasis on building communily 
through activities and evenis that 
lead sludenis out of ihe classroom 
while still encouraging iheu growth 
and education. 

"The honors program is for slu- 
dents looking for a greater challenge 
and sludents who are excited about 
the exchange of ideas," said Kubik. 

According io Kubik, be wants 
sludenis to become involved wilh 



four programs currendy under way: 
Honors Lunch Table, Honors Fitness 
Challenge, IPFW Honors 
Gymnasium 
and the Fori 
y n e 
urn of 
An's "Bearing 
i t n e s s " 
exhibit. 

Last 
semester the 
Honors Lunch 
Table started 
and continues 
to meet on 
Thursdays The 
(able feaiures 
casual conver- 
sation and the presence of a different 
guest each week. 




"Often I'll even stick flowers in a 
pot for ihe table." joked Kubik. 

Kubik said Ihe luncheon takes 
place in Walb's cafeteria and that he 
is there from 11.30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. 
and sludenis, are welcome to come 
and go as their schedule requires. 
Some of the guesis for the semester 
include leanne Barone. instructor of 
communication, and Robert Zellers, 
director of financial aid. 

The Honors Gymnasium is based 
upon the ancient gymnasium of 
Greece which was a center for boih 
athletics and learning. Just as Plato 
and his sludents met, Kubik hopes to 
gather studenis for a 10-minute lec- 
ture on health and fitness before the 
sludenis use the facility. The Honors 
Gymnasium will lake place every 
Tuesday from 3 p.m. (o 4 p.m 



Also emphasizing the impor- 
tance of health is the Fitness 
Challenge program. Upon signing 
up in Gales Sports Center. Room 
202. studenis receive a calendar and 
training tips. Participants track their 
own fitness activities on the calen- 
dars. Sludents design their own phys- 
ical based on ibeir own regimen. 

"The goal is to build a schedule 
of consistency," said Kubik. 

Sludents will turn in their calen- 
dar monthly and prizes like T-shirts 
or water bottles will be awarded to 
those who reach their fitness goals at 
the end of the six- to eight- 
week program.

In Augusi 1990. Trish Anderson- 
Boerger was driving from Piqua, 
Ohio, to her home in Chicago. She 
had just attended her 25m year high 
school reunion. As the miles passed, 
she reflected upon her high school 
dream of becoming a journalist: a 
dream thai had been interrupted by 
life's complications. 

"Ii suddenly dawned on me thai, 
if I was going to achieve my dream, 
I had to gel moving on it," said 
Anderson-Boerger as she recalled 
the momeni thai ended the deiour her 
career had taken. 

She relumed to her good-paying 
job ai a Chicago compuier firm, but 
did not lose her resolve. She saved 
and planned, then quit her job and 
moved lo Fon Wayne in October 
1990. In January 1991. she began 
attending classes pan-time ai IPFW 

The challenges of college were 
much easier to face this time ihan in 
her previous attempt at Ohio 
University. She bad been fresh out of 
high school and was burdened with 
the insecurities and uncertainty thai 
ofien trouble younger students. 
Anderson-Boerger resumed her 
pursuit for a degree with ihe per- 
spective of an adult 

"I was so determined. Nothing 
was going io slow me down," she 
said. 

She increased her credit load 



until she became a full-time student 
She took tougher courses during the 
summer months Along the way. she 
received support, encouragement 
from friends and instructors, espe- 
cially Ann Colbert, journalism coor- 
dinator. In May, Anderson-Boerger 
graduated with a GPA of 3,77. 

A tip from a friend led to free- 
lance assignments with Neighbors, a 
weekly supplement to The News- 
Sentinel, beginning in February 
1 995 After receiving her degree, she 
informed her Neighbors' editor. 
Connie Haas Zuber. that she was 
interested in a full-time position. 
Zuber suspected that she was a good 
journalist. 

"1 could see her determina- 
tion., the constant improvement in 
her work," said Zuber 

Anderson-Boerger became a 
half-time freelance reporter in 
August of 1995. She graduated lo a 
half-lime siaff reporter when the 
position opened up in November 
1996. 

Anderson-Boerger became a 
full-lime staff reporter when ihe 



Neighbors section merged with the 
Metro desk in December. 

For aspiring journalists, she 
advises academic preparation, deter- 
mination and a knowledge of what 
you want lodo. 

Zuber said she believes there 
must be some aspect of a journalism 
career so compelling that n makes it 
worth all the constant demands and 
deadlines reporters Ihey face daily. 



For Anderson-Boerger, finding 
her spot in the newsroom was like 
coming home Along Ihe way, she 
never turned down an assignment 
regardless of bow daunting or mun- 
dane it may have sounded. 

"I was willing to go wherever. 
whenever." said Anderson-Boerger. 
"I knew it would lake me ultimately 
to where I wanted io be And ii did "

Headaches: a cause of distraction

MIGRAINE HEADACHE 

There are probably few people

recurring more frequently, it war- 
ranto further investigation and possi- 
bly medical intervention. 

According to Bradley. (1996). 
migraine headaches affect twenty 
percent of females and about six 



percent of males The causes of 
migraines arc not determined; how- 
ever, some factors have been found 
to be related. Emotional stress, 
dietary substances, and inadequate 
sleep or food intake are possible 
causes for some sufferers

Migraine 
headaches 
have been sep- 
arated into two 
types: migraine 
with an aura and 
migraine without an

aura begin with a prodromal phase 
that precedes the headache. This 
phase is characterized by visual dis-

zigzagging light, tingling or numb-

thought, drowsiness, dizziness or 
difficulty speaking. After Oils, the 
pain begins, which is usually local- 
ized but then spreads over the one or 
both sides of the head Migraine suf- 
ferers describe the pain as sharp. 
slabbing, throbbing and excruciat- 
ing The migraine sufferer might be 
light- or sound- sensitive. There also, 
may be nausea, vomiting and diar- 
rhea. The migraine without an aura 
is characterized by beginning of the 
pain without Uie warning symptoms. 
The headache is the same, begin- 
ning in one area and usually spread- 
ing over tbe same or both sides of 
the head. 

Treatment of migraines includes 
medications and behavioral modifi- 
cations. Some medications are pre- 
scribed lo be laken as a preventative 
measure every day. There have been 
developments in drugs that can be 
taken during the prodromal phase if 
the person recognizes that a 
migraine is beginning Other medi- 
cations are used strictly for pain 
relief after the headache sets in. 

There arc some behaviors that 
can prevent a migraine These 
include getting adequate sleep con- 
sistently, eating well-balanced 
meals, developing healthy coping 
strategies for stress and relaxation 
techniques. 



CLUSTER HEADACHE 

Cluster headaches are rare, 
affecting five to 10 times fewer per- 
sons than migraine headaches. The 
most common forms of cluster 
headaches occur every twenty-four 
hours for a couple of weeks and then 
subside for months and years. The 
causes of cluster headaches are 
unclear however factors have been 
identified which trigger their onset. 
Seasons of the year are often report- 
ed by cluster headache sufferers as 
factors in their headache incidence 
This may be related lo the hours of 
daylight during that season Sleep 
itself can be a trigger, especially 
REM sleep. Daytime napping may 
also cause a headache during the 
cluster. Vasodilating substances 
such as histamine, nitroglycerine 
and alcohol will induce an attack 
during the cluster period. 

The headache usually lasts 45 to 
90 minutes and usually sets in short- 
ly after falling asleep During the 
cluster, sleep deprivation is fre- 
quently a problem related to fear of 
falling asleep leading to a headache 
The pain is one-sided and of terrible 
intensity that is often described as 
boring, excruciating and non-throb- 
bing The unique diagnostic clue 
occurring with cluster headaches is 



same-side tearing of the eye. nasal 
stuffiness or runniness and drooping 
of ihe eyelid. These symptoms are 
often misdiagnosed as trigeminal 
neuralgia, sinus or dental problems 
The sufferer often cannot sit still 
and paces or rocks When the pain 
resolves, the sufferer is left exhaust- 
ed. 

Management of cluster 
headaches includes medicaiion and 
oxygenation. During a cluster peri- 
od, alcohol should be avoided. 
There are medications that can be 
given to prevent an attack during 
cluster period or year-round. In 
addition, medications used simply 
as pain control during an attack are 
available but have been ineffective 
for many sufferers 

TENSION-TYPE 
HEADACHE 

Tension-type headaches are the 
daily or almost daily headaches 
affecting a larger number of patients 
who seek medical treatment eacl 
year. Tension headaches may or may 
not be associated with prolonged 
overwork, stress or emotional strain. 
The distinction between tension- 
type headaches and the above men- 
tioned vascular headaches has 
become less certain.

sion-iypc headaches usually 
involves both sides of the head as 
well as the neck and shoulders. The 
pain is dull and aching and there 
may be a feeling of tightness or full- 
ness. 

Treatment for lension-type 
headaches may involve over-the- 
counter medications with trade 
names sucb as Tylenol. Advil. 
Excedrin, etc. Massage or other 
relaxation icchniiiues used to reduce 
muscle tension and stress are often 
effective. Sleep can offer relief 
through total body relaxation and 
biofeedback has also been effective. 

iMlhougb a headache is a very 
common complaint, it should never

HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp; A 



Q. Just how effective 
are condoms at 
preventing AIDS? 

A. Recent studies show 
that latex condoms, used 
correctly and consistently, 
do prevent the 
transmission of HIV, the 
virus that causes AIDS. 
They also prevent the 
transmission of other STD's 
such as syphilis and 
gonorrhea. Animal 
membrane condoms 
should NOT be counted on 
to prevent STD's.

Airline strike hurts all 

Compromise needed 



We all saw ii coming. The 
ingredients were perfect 
for a strike. Two groups 
dependent on each other for their 
livelihood — when suddenly, one 
group wants changes American 
Airlines pilots union did just that 
when the airline failed to meet die 
pilots' requests for change 

The piloLs, as well as American 
Airlines, both have valid arguments 
The issues at stake arc: pilots' 
wages, stock options and job securi- 
ty Some criticize the President for 
intervening into the labor market. 
arguing it took most of the bargain- 
ing power from the pilots 

The president had to intervene 
when it was obvious that negotia- 
tions had stopped and the strike 
would continue The consequences 
had he not intervened would have 
been much worse. A strike of this 
proportion would be devastating to 
our economy and the country alike 
The strike has been estimated lo 
cost the country S200 million a day. 

This is precisely what gives the 
pilots and their union such strong 
bargaining power against the airline 
It also emphasizes the importance of 
the pilots should the company not 
concede to the demands of the 
pilots, especially when we depend 
on those 9.000 American Airlines 
pilots everyday to fly our business 
people, tourists and families from 
state to state. 

Since the airline failed to con- 
cede to the demands of the pilots 
union, intervening was necessary in 
order to protect the economy The 
move took all bargaining power 
from the pilots Had the President 
not intervened, it's possible that the 
airline would have given in to the 
demands of pilots sooner. However, 
when the stakes are as expensive as 
these no one really wants to take the 



chance to find out 

One thing is sure, the pilots and 
the airlines need to compromise 
soon The issues the pilots care 
about are valid ones — common 
issues that have gone on ever since 
unions began protecting workers — 
issues that deal with more pay and 
job security. It is the little guys ver- 
sus the big guys, except never 
before have the little guys had so 
much bargaining power. 

Trie union wants higher wages 
for its pilots than the company 
wants to pay; the union wants larger 
stock options in the airline than the 
airline is willing to give; and the 
pilots union fears thai with talks of 
getting more commuter flights with 
lower-paid pilots, routes will be 
taken away from its pilots. 

The airline's argument is under- 
standable as well If it concedes lo 
the demands of the pilots, its costs 
would be so high that the airline 
could no longer compete with oth- 
ers 

Probably the most troubling 
argument for the pilots themselves 
is that of job security The regular 
American pilots want to be the ones 
who fly the company's subsidiary 
commuter flights as opposed to the 
lower paid American Eagle pilots 
who belong to a different union. 

Obviously American Airlines 
and its pilots have forgotten the 
main staple of our government and 
how things operate— compromise. 
A strike benefits no one The work- 
ers are not getting paid, and the job 
is not getting done. How long 
should the American people have to 
live in chaos until these two groups 
realize that they need each other? 
The 60-day freeze should be ample 
time for both sides to reach a fair 
agreement. The pilots and the airline 
need to reach a compromise. 




U.S. Media in Cuba 

Weighing the benefits 



"Practice what you preach" 
ought to be America's new bumper 
sticker. We say this because it's hyp- 
ocritical that the Clinton 
Administration has allowed the US 
to open news bureaus in Cuba now 
despite the fact that we have been 
working to isolate the communist 
country and threatening others for 
doing business with them. 

Forget that Congress enacted 
The Helms-Burton Act, which 
works to punish other countries who 
do business with Cuba For this act 
seems to apply to any country other 
than our own. The U.S. preaches to 
other countries about not doing 
business with Cuba yet those words 
and our laws do not apply to 
American interests. 

They do not stop us from doing 
business with Cuba In fact. Sen 
Jesse Helms, R-N.C , the author of 
the Helms-Burton Act, is a strong 
supporter of opening news bureaus 
in Cuba, as are a number of other 



members of Congress 

The benefits of opening news 
bureaus are obvious It would 
expose the oppressive conditions in 
Cuba and publicize those who are 
advocating a democratic change in 
Cuba. Congress obviously hopes 
this acts as a catalyst for a demo- 
cratic movement in Cuba. 

In any event, the problem then 
arises as to where we draw the line 
with other countries doing business 
in Cuba. Is it okay for us lo open 
news bureaus there because the 
good outweighs the bad in this case? 
The U.S. ought to play by the same 
rules ii sets for other countries. 

We can no longer preach 
against and punish other coun- 
tries for doing business in Cuba 
simply because in this case wc 
think our reasons are better jus- 
tified However the Clinton 
Administration would like to 
justify it. il is still doing busi- 
ness with Cuba

Sorority life: Nothing to scoff at 




movies, every sorority girl's name 
is Misty, Bambi or Trixi, and frat 
boys are loud, drunken fools who 
care more about womanizing than 
getting an education. 

If you believe all that you see 
and read, you're really missing out 
on a crucial and active part of uni- 
versity life 



perfect, you just ' 

You know exactly what 1 mean 

— sorority girls. If I asked you, 
you'd probably tell me sorority girls 
are carbon copies of each other, 
they're not intelligent and they tend 
to be more exclusive than inclusive. 

Look, if sororities were really 
like thai, I wouldn't have joined 
one. I'm tired of hearing the stereo- 
types about sororities and until 
you've checked il out, until you join 
us ai a party, or study with us, or eat 
lunch with us in our suite — don't 
knock it 

As a freshman. I came to col- 
lege in search of something. Sure, 
an education was part of it, but so 
was finding a "for-real" college life. 
I never wanted lo go to a big cam- 
pus — it just wasn't in my scheme. 
My only fear was that by deciding 
against attending school on campus, 
I mighi be compromising the col- 
lege life I'd dreamed of. Guess what 

— college life is alive here at IPFW 
and I found it by geiung involved in 
Greek life 

Obscured media representations 
and a lack of information has fueled 
the fire of ignorance about sorori- 
ties and fraternities alike In the

"I'm tired of 

hearing the 

stereotypes 

about sororities 

and until you've 

checked it out, 

until you join us at a 

party, or study with 

us, or eat lunch with 

us in our suite 

— don't knock it." 



the 
social 
Greek orga- 
nizaiions 
(two men's 
and two 
women's 
groups) are 
constantly 
looking for 
well-round- 
ed individ- 
uals who 
possess 
qualities of 
leadership, 
intelli- 
gence, 
kindness, 
communi- 
ty aware- 
ness and 
friendship. 

Social Greek organisations at 
IPFW have entertained a wide vari- 
ety of people for a long lime. 
Ironically, many years ago my own 
mother was involved in a sorority 
here that later became the present 
day Pi Beta Phi My godmoihcr, on 



the other hand, was once a member 
of Delta Gamma — the sororiiy in 
which 1 am now an active member 
I am not as aware of the history 
of the men's fraternal groups, Phi 
Kappa Theia and Sigma Phi 
Epsilon, but I am sure they've had 
equally strong pasts on campus. 

Sororities 
add a sense of 
stability to 
your education. 
There is 
always some- 
one to lum to 
when you have 



qui 



s t i o n s 



about classes 
or majors. A 
close friend 
isn't far away 
when you've 



ot 



citin 



news to share 
or when things 
just aren ' t 
going right. 
There's always 
a reason to 
make it to 
school on time 
and lo do your 
best — the 25 
other girls in 
your sorority 
who depend on you lo give your 
all — always. 

Sororities also provide mem- 
bers with the chance to grow 
through leadership and community 
involvement. Delta Gamma and Pi 
Beta Phi have philanthropic inter- 
ests such as sight conservation and 



literacy. The groups work nicely 
together, planning outgoing pro- 
jects that serve this campus and 
community well. 

Another interesting part of 
IPFW Greek life is that it differs 
gready from Greek life on other 
campuses. Students who rushed the 
seemingly impersonal fraternities 
and sororities on big campuses have 
found IPFW's Greeks to be more 
closely knit and more concerned 
about the individual's needs. 

Sure, each of IPFW's fraterni- 
ties are smaller chapters of some of 
ihe U.S.'s most prestigious social 
Greek organizations, but IPFW's 
Greeks are just as respected by their 
national organizations and by 
employers alike. 

Believe il or noi. employers 
appreciate the skills and opportuni- 
ties sororities and fraternities pro- 
vide potential employees with. 
Networking between Greeks is a 
way to improve your chances of 
getting a better job or Finding new 
opportunities where none have 
existed otherwise. 

So. if you're interested in being 
something more man an ordinary 
student on a commuter campus or 
you' re just someone who's carrying 
around some of the oldest stereo- 
types in the books, give us a shot. 

You're going lo find we're 
a vastly diverse group of peo- 
ple who have really found our 
niche here on IPFW's campus 
You won't regret il.

To the edilor: 

I would like to lake a moment 
and reflect back on Valentine's 
Day. What is the point of this day 
(o begin with? 

To me. it is just a day thai all 
(he happy couples in the world 
gel together and celebrate their 
love by exchanging gifts and pre- 
sents, candy and flowers, while 
the rest of us single people 
stand by and look wistfully at 
their happy expressions. 

Okay, so maybe I'm going a 
little overboard, but when you're 
single, it's a little hard lo take. 
The point I'm trying to make 



here is that why should happy 
couples have a day all to them- 
selves? Shouldn't there be a 
day where single people gel 
together, buy each other gifts, 
and for once, make Ihe cou- 
ples feel left oul? 

And another thing thai both- 
ers me aboul Valentine's Day is 
that 1 don'l understand the point 
of buying something, like flow- 
ers, that is jusi going lo die in a 
few days anyway? 

I know ihe poini of 
Valenlinc's Day is to express the 
love one person feels toward 
another person, bul do you really 
have lo buy that person some- 



thing in order to show them Lhat 
you love Ihem? 

So, really, what is the point of 
Valentine's Day? Is the point to 
make money? Yes. The point is 
for the card makers and the 
florists all over the world to com- 
mercialize the holiday. 

It seems more like a waste of 
money than anything. And peo- 
ple in grocery stores complain 
more about what they're spend- 
ing than on the fact that their 
loved one is going to enjoy the 
gift lhat they're going to gel.

Intramurals benefit students 

Health, social interaction are byproducts of IPFW game plan 



Infra-mural: No, this is noi a 
fancy wall painting within a slate, a 
building or the tike. As in the case of 
athletics, it does usually happen 
within the walls of a sports facility, 
(hough 

Intramurals arc played by the 
willing and available students of a 
particular college, the level of play 
can be as varied as the student pop- 
ulation itself. IPFW has a diverse 
population of students who played 
sports in high school, some who 
didn't and some who just like phys- 
ical exercise. 

Exercise and sports can provide a 
beneficial link between health and 
academics for many students. 

"If you're not feeling well." Jim 
Poller, interim sports information 
director said, "it's easy to bug off 
classes or loose attention " 

Porter did not say that intramural 
snorts arc a cure-all for academic 



problems. Porter said he wanted to 
make an important point: Exercise is 
key to a healthy life, and many 
health professionals have empha- 
sized this Intramural sports offers 
many avenues to get your exercise 
and have fun doing it. Porter 
believes. 

Another advantage of intramurals 
is playing sports with other students 
that enjoy the same interests as you. 
Most of us know how boring a date 
can be when two people have little 



as well lake advantage of the facili- 
ties you are helping paying for. 

"It is important that people other 
than athletes are given an opportuni- 
ty to use the facilities." said Porter 
Intramurals are offered through- 
out the school year, and more than 
basketball 



Intramurals may not be as much 
fun as a date, but you could do a lot 
worse. This is just one more way of 
making friends and meeting people 
on a campus where almost everyone 
commutes. 

Although there is no on-campus 
housing, many students feel as if 
they live here anyway. With hectic 
schedules, challenging classes and 
other responsibilities, intramural 
sports can offer you a welcome 
break to your week. Plus, you might 



ble. 
Men's, women's 
and some co-ed 
leagues are 
offered in vol- 
leyball, racquet- 
ball, basketball 
and billiards with the sport and 
number of teams being the deciding 
factor dealing with the total number 
of people involved. 

Most offer tournaments of some 
sort. Intramural basketball will be 
holding a double-elimination tour- 
nament this spring, while the bil- 
liards tournament winner will move 



to a national tournament which 
awards trophies and cash prizes. 

Even without the incentives. 
intramural sports offer something 
that organized school athletics can- 
not — an opportunity for everyone

After several painstaking hours 
of pouring over list upon list of the 
greatest sports movies of our gener-

"North Dallas 40." 

• At the bottom of the list is a lit-

Kurt Russell as old high school bud-

number nine and is by far the funni- 
est movie on the list and after 
watching it, you won't be able to eat 
another Baby Ruth. 

• A recent flic crossed the tape at 
number eight, "Soul of the Game"

very supportive of the idea and were 
proactive in developing the sugges- 
tion.

loon to bnng something into the 
campus and push and get something 
accomplished," said Gounans

locating spots that meet the fire code 
and are convenient locations. She 
encourages students to e-mail her at

From Innsbruck, the Eurail sys- 
tem reaches all of Austria and much
