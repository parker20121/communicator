When there's a challenge, 
quality makes the difference. 

We hope you have some fun with the challenge. 
There's another challenge we'd like to offer you, too. 

The Pabst challenge: 

We welcome the chancejo prove the quality of 
our beer. We challenge you to taste and compare 
Pabst Blue Ribbon to any other premium beer. You'll 
like Pabst better. Blue Ribbon quality means the best 
tasting beer you can get. Since 1 844 it always has.
