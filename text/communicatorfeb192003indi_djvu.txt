The NSSE, through The 
College Student Report, will

Edna D. Ncal.'iPFW Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs, 
believes it will bcnclil the school 
when Ihc results are relumed. 

She estimates they will be 
n!luinod-ta.lPi;iV admlnislra- 
Iton laic in Ihe spring semeslet. 
"We think il will be anollier 
way for us to gather information 
.iboul whal student altitudes 



are. Whal Iheir opinions arc. 
What they say Iheir needs are so 
that we can plan appropriately," 
Neale.lplained, 

The (our-page surveys are 
being sent Ihiough direcl mail 
along with a self-addressed 
stamped envelope for returning 
the form lo NSSE, 

"The national of/ice is eslab- 

pus of Indiana University, 
They are promoting and respon- 
sible for the survey," Neal 
enplflined. The website for Ihe 
survey is www.iub.edu/-nsse. 

Within the over 90 qucslions, 
participants are also asked 
about their co-curricular activi- 
ties; how much they work; how 
Ihe inslitution helps individuals 
cope with non-academic 
responsibilities; and inclusion of 
diverse perspeclives in class dis- 
cussions and writing aspvnoiS 
Not every student will 
receive a survey, she noted, 
. "They ore gelling a represen- 
tative sample of our U.OOO-plus 
student population. They will 
be randomly selected and it is 
-~ ijTTious process," Neal 



Willie it is the tirst time IPFW 
has parlicipated in the NSSE 
process, the university has pre- 
viously done its own. 

"We conduded an on&lt;am- 
pus survey in the fall semester 
that was a measure of student 
satisfaction," Neal staled, "The 
school recently received those 
results and is looking over Ihe 
information now," she said. 

For Ihose who are tapped to 
take part in the survey, Neal 
encouraged them lo lake the 
time to participate and return 
their opinions. 

It is a standard form that 
appears similar to evaluation 
sheets students complete at the 
end of every semester although 
larger in scope and focus. 

Like those, Neat said it is to 
enhance the school. 

"It's trying to measure 
those Ihings that contribute (o a 
student's success hi I experience 
al college, ' she remarked. 'Fill 
it out and gel it back in the 
mail," Neal added.

lU Learning Program wins award 
Hesburgh pays tribute to faculty 



BLOOMINGTON. Ind, - Indiana 
University Bloomuigton's Scholarship of 
Teaching and Learning Program has 
been named the wirmcr of the 2003' 
Theodore M. Hesburgh Award, which is 
presented each year to Ihe college or 
university judged lo have the most 
effective faculty development program 
that enhances undergraduate leaching 
and learning. 

The award was presented Monday 
(Feb, 17) during the American Council 

Washington, D.C. 



faculty members from around thi 
pus to engage in cross-disciplinary 
research and discussioris on what works 
in the classroom, 

"Receiving the Hesburgh Award is 
a tribute lo Ihe many faculty who have 
been involved in the Scholarship of 
Teaching and Learning Program at lUB 
and an affirmation of Ihe program's 
effectiveness in enhancing students' aca- 
demic success," said Sharon Stephens 
Brehm. chancellor of lU Bloomington. 

The SOTL program was initiated 
by Dean of the Faculties Moya Andrews, 
working with a small group of faculty 
members and teaching development 
staff, in the fall of 1998. They were look- 
ing for the atisiver to a basic question: 
How can we best improve undergradu- 
ate learning? 

"What makes this program special 
is not Ihat our faculty are always look- 
ing for ways lo improve their teaching 
effectiveness, but that thev are willing to 
apply Iheir research skills to questions 



ot how students learn in their own class- 
es," said Jeanne Sept, a professor of 
anthropology and associate dean of the 
faculties who helps oversee Ihe program. 
"They are engaged not merely in 
'how to teach' exercises, but in creating 
new research knowledge related to 
higher education practice in different 
disciplines, and they are committed to 
sharing this knowledge with Iheir 

'The Hesburgh Award, coming so 
soon after the rccognilion by Time mag- 
azine of lUB as College of the Year 
among research universities, clearly 
indicates the campus' strong commit- 
ment to maximizing Ihe learning experi- 
ence for our students," Bretun said. 

The award is named in honor of Ihe 
Rev. Theodore M Hesburgh, C,S,C., 

KesidenI emeritus of Ihe Univcrsily of 
Dtre Dame, a nationally renowned 
educator and humanitarian. Il is spon- 
sored by TIAA-CREF, a leading national 
financial services organization. 

Last year, lUPUl was one of four 
universities lo receive a certificate of 
excellence through Ihe program for its 
Gateway program to entuncc student 

TIAA-CREF created the award to

A potential solution to high gas prices b 



1 v/35 rillmg up my gas tank last week right 
. after the prices jumped up lo S1.75 a gallon. As I 
was paying (or Ihe gas, I made a casual comment 
lo the clerk about how high the prices had gotten. 
The clerk, a young lady in her early twenties, shot 
a reply back that nearly floored me. 1 don'l 
remember eiadly what she said, bul it resembled 
■his: "Yeah, that dairut Bush. If he would just keep 
his nose out of the whole world's business, we 
wouldn't be paying S2 for a freaking gallon of gas." 

I couldn't help bul think Out alarge number 
of people might believe that President Bush is 
solely responsible for gas prices getting so high. In 
a way, I actually agree with Ihcm. Don'l be 
shocked. I may be a conservative columnist, but I 
am not ignorant of the effect that the crisis in Iraq 
is having on Ihe price of oil. As someone who 
values truth over any political or ideological loyalty, 
I will concede that the threat of war in Iraa is 
surely raising oil and gas prices. To claim that 
president is the sole reason (or this incre: 
however, is ridiculous. 

Let us not forgel that there is much more 

Soing on in Ihe world than jusi Ihc situation in 
aq. The labor stoppage in Venezuela has probably 
affected Ihe cost of oil and g3.s in the United States 
far more Ifian the situation wilh Iraq, The Utile 
known truth is thai Venezuela is the fourth largest 
oil producer in Ihe world. IVc import more oil 
from Venezuela than any Middle Eastern country 



ocept Saudi Arabia. The work stoppage has 
slowed oil produclion from Venezuela to a crawl 
and undoubtedly tias more lo do with gasoline 
prices in the United States than Iraq ever could. 
Throw in a very cold and long winter, which raises 
heating oil production and decreases petroleum 
production, and you have the eiplanation for the 
cost of gas lisine so dramatically. 

The UnitcoStates is dependent on foreign oil. 
Until we figure out a way to alleviate this 
dependence, we will forever be at Ihe mercy of 
other countries when it comes to oil and gas 
prices. President Bush, in what I believe was a 
very misguided and ill-conceived attempt to 
endear himself to the liberal environmentalists, 
proposed a govemmenl program to develop a 
hyiMOgen-powered car. While this is a noble concept, 
it is rot practical. It costs as much to isolate and 
prepare the hydrogen to power this car as it does 

gasoline. The hydrogen car may be cleaner, but it 
will also be more expensive lo purdiase and operate. 
In the end. it will not end our dependence on 
foreign oil. 

Now. 1 do have an answer to this whole 
foreign oil dependence, and I'm sure it won't be 
Ihe (itsi lime you have heard of it. In the Arctic 
National Wildlife Rehigc (ANWR) in Alaska, there 
is enough oil to elimmale our need for foreign oil 
altogether. Bul we have a problem — the 
environmenlalists are more worried about a few 
bunny rabbits and elk than the American people. 
President Bush proposed drilling in the ANWR 



last year, bul the Democrat-controlled 
Senate didn't even allow the bill to 
come up for a vote. After Ihe bill wa.s 
shelved, the Senate Majority Leader 
stated, "We are not going to allow the 
Republicans to destroy the en vironmenl.' 
Let me tell you the truth about 
ANWR. This refuge stretches over 
some 19 million acres in Alaska. The 
environmentalists and Democrats 
would have you bcheve that President 
Bush wants lo strip mine the whole 
fact the proposed drilling area w. 

By allowing oil companies to drill for oil in 
one-tenth of one percent of the total area of 
ANWR, we could produce enough oil to 
completely meet the needs of our country. When 
you look at Ihis with these numbers in mind, how 
can anyone say that this plan is equivalent lo 
"destroving the enviroruncnl?" 

All political and environmental issues aside, 
the fact remains that the United Stales needs oil. 
Our businesses, our citiMns and our economy in 
general revolve around having a conslani ard 
affordable supply oi pelroleum products for heahng. 
manufacturing and transportahon. Without this 
vital product, the country as we know it would 
cease to function. 

Progress and scientific research will lead us to 
more efficient and cost effeclive methods of 
transportation, but for Ihe immediate future, 
gasoline and combustion engines are all we have 




down to a matter of pnorities — do 



frozen hindra of Alaska? The state of Alaska supports 
drilling in ANWR. as do the current administralion 
and most Americans who would love to see the 
dependence on foreign oil ended completely. All 
that stands in Ihe way of Ihis projecl are two 
things^ the Democratic parly (which doesn't seem 
to care what the average American pavs for a gallon 
of gasoline as long as the president cloesn't get his 
way) and the environmentalists (who would sec 
the whole country riding bicycles lo work before 
they would allow a long lailed mouse lo be moved 
five feet from his home). 

Wilh all due respect to both groups, I'd place 
the good of the American people above the good 
of a mouse any day of Ihe week. The solution lo 
skyrocketing gas prices is obvious: DriU for oil in 
ANWR and provide all the oil we need for 
ourselves. 



Why an oil war with Iraq? 



important factor in the cosl of fuel is 
Ihe world's (particularly America's) 
unstable relationship with Iraq. 
Ovemighl. the price of gasoline can 
and has risen dramahcaily. Though 
there are many factors that determine 
gasoline prices, the dramatic spikes we 
are fcelmg arc due to tensions wilh 
Iraq. The current rise occurred nol 
because there was a sudden shortage 
of crude oil, not because taites were 
increased and nol because NATO had suddenly 
tightened its hold on oil. Ralher. it happened 
because false tips about U,N. sentiments led 
suppliers lo leap in fear. Their leap is now costing 
us almost 30 cenls more per gallon at Ihe pump. 

On MSNBC news, 1 found a report titled 
-Oil. Ihe Other Iraq War." Iraq sits atop the 
world's second largest oil reserve. This well of 
resource is worth hundreds of billions of 
American dollars and on enormous amount of 
economic power, a fad thai figures into much of 
Ihe polilics concerning not just America, but also 
Russia's and France's policies toward Iraq. 1 have 
already gone on and on about my sentiments 
concerning America's policies and my feelings 
about our oil agenda, so I would like to lake this 
editorial's focus elsewhere. 

Since my last editorial was about the blame 




nc, I w 



ly last edito 

ltd like to shift the focus back oi 
If you, the readers, i 



hltp;// 1 rovcl.howstuffworks.com/gas-pr 

It explains all the ins and ouls of the oil industry 
much belter than I could m this short editorial. 

So back lo us, Americans. We complain about 
the price of gasoline, yet we consume much more 
and pay much less at the pump Ihan China, 
Englantl. Norway. North and South Korea or 
France, As a matter of fad, we consume more and 
pay less than any o Ihe r industrialized nation, yel 
still we lament and complain about the tugh cosl 
of hiel. We are like a great herd of cattle. VVe look 
out at green pastures and graze. We never Ihmk 
about the (act that we are consuming much more 
than our share of natural resources. 

We are a capitalist nation filled with a consumer 
mentality. Most Americans find it difficult to recycle, 
much less limit consumption. We ore a throw- 
away society. How many of you. (the readers) 
recycle, compost waste and limit eleclric and fuel 
consumption? When you turn on a light, do you 
think fltHDul the amount oi fuel needed lo generate 
the electricity bein^ consumed? When you fill 
yourcar'sgas tank, is your first thought gratitude 



for the ability to drive (reely in your personal 
transportation, or is it the price of gasoline? 

Our thirst for fuel is insatiable. According to 
the Web site listed previously, Americans drive 2.6 
trillion miles per year, a distance that equals 
14,000 round trips to the sun. Our gasoline 
consumption has almost doubled since 1980. 
Acconding lo the Department of Energy, in the 
year2000 we consumed an average of 19J million 
barrels of oil every day. 43 percent of that was 
used to fuel our autos, boats. RV's, etc. That 
equals 3.6 gallons of gasoline per household, per 
day. It may be lime to look at developing and 
utilizing more public transportation options. 

Considering Ihe fad that the United Stales is 
Ihc second largest oil producer in the world, I 
wonder why we choose a lifestyle that demands 
dependence on foreign oil. Bather than fight over 
the resources of Ihe worid, doesn't il make sense 
lo begin lo look at ways lo conserve or own 
resources? Our dependence on foreign oil had a 
crippline effect on the country in 1973 and 1974, 
during the oil embargo. It is time to let loose of 
our ir\flated dependence on oil. pull oil out of Ihe 
pohlical arena and look at permanent soluhons to 
our consumption and energy problems. 

If we want personal transportation, lei's 
begin to insist on an introduction to alternative 
engines. General Motors has developed the 
world's first driveable fuel-cell and by-wire 
veNcle. It combines hydrogen fuel&lt;ell technology 
with by-wire lecfmology, GM is lookmg at ways 

Wilh modem technology this is possible. 
Though the Hy-WIre costs over £5 million today. 
CM is predicting an affordable version by 2010. 

Hydrogen is just one possibilih'. ivhat about, 
water, com and bio-diesel fuel {made from hemp). 
We can point our fingers and mumble complaints 
all we want, bul the simple fact is, we are to blame 
for our own predicament. We are dependent 
children who want more, but don'l want to pay 
the price. Maybe il is lime for Americans to grow 
up. But tfiat's just my opinion.

Prejudice: The internal conflict 



You hale me? Well, I hate 
you back. Welcome to life in 
2003, Hate has taken over our 
country, hate has taken over tfie 
world. Racism, sexism, any 
"ism" you can think of. "I hate 
you because you're Mexican or 
you're female." Those kinds of 
things are a part of society. 

But prejudice as it is comes 
in shapes, sizes and forms. The 
"isms' aren't the only prejudice 
anymore. It's sad. because at a 
time when Ihe world should be 
united, we all hale each other. 
Hate's a strong word, but sadly 
it's not even strong enough to 
measure some prejudices. 

I'm a prel^' left wing guy I 
thiiJt the fact we most likely will 
end up in war is stupid. I think 
George W, Bush is an idiot. 
That's my opirvion. The world 
should be at peace, but then we 
have so-calfed leaders who 
seem lo want us to be apart. It 
doesn't really seem like George 



America should be strong, w 



ns. America has 
, Sspl 



should do 
apart at the 

2001, Not because of Osama bin 
Laden, nol because of Saddam 
and not because of Nortfi Korea, 
They didn't knock America 
down. We knocked ourselves 
down. All the problems we 
have, we bring on ourselves, 
I'm not saying Saddam is 



not a horrible man — he is. No, 
I don't have sympathy for 
the terrorists of 9/11, they 
were horrible people, loo, Bul 
for us lo stand strong, not as a 
country, but as Ihe human race. 
we need lo accept some 
responsibility. 

This is where prejudice has 
gone on a rampage. Instead of 
takmg Tcsponsibilily, we push 
off the blame. It's easy lo say 
"He did il. nol me." From the 
large to Ihe small, it's sickening 
what we do to ourselves. 

Shortly after 9/11, the 
prejudice was on any person 
who even looked Middle 
Easlem, People from Mexico or 
Puerto Rico were shunned 
because a relatively small group 
of Afghanistan terrorists 
attacked America, II was truly a 
sad sight. Even the three students 
from Afghanistan who attended 
my school got bothered less 
than some Lalincis, 

But for all Ihe big prejudices. 
, — — many little ones, 
i-asi weeK i was in downloivn 
Indianapolis, As I walked down 
Ihe street. 1 passed a man who 
was begging (or change, I 
solemnly said, "Sorry, 1 don'l 
have any." and walked on. 

The sad thing was Ihat I 
was embarrassed walking by 
him. Not for film, but for me. 
That's just the way the world 
works and it's sickening. Sure I 
had no change. Of course, 1 only 
had SID. But what stopped me 
from slopping at a McDonald's 
and buying some hot food for 
this man on a cold day? It's 
things like that which lear the 






world apart. It's the little things 
lltat matter the most. 

We're all prejudiced in 
some way. I'm not saying I am 
any belter about it Ihan anyone 
else. Bul I know belter, and I 
don't change. That makes you 
think. 

It's not just things like that. 
You hear of former gang members 
gelling murdered and you say 
'good riddance.' But what obout 
that person's family, who is 
suffering? You immediately 
judge Ihc person and forget 
what his family is going 
through. 

stand outside clinics and judge 
people who have abortions. Bul 
do those people know the 
circumstances behind Ihat 
abortion? Do they lake Ihe lime 
to find out? No, they just call the 

gri a murderer and ignore her 
elings. 

I think Everlasl said il best 
in his late 'gOs hil song "What 
It's Like." During the chorus, 
after breoking down prejudice 
circumstances, Everlasl says, 
"Bul god forbid you ever liad lo 
walk a mile in their shoes, 
because then you really might 
know what it's like,,." 

So as George and the boys 
look forward to war, don't just 
sit back and judge. Don't say il's 
wrong, don't sav il's right. 

Get up and do your pari to 
make it belter. Be liberal, be con- 
servative, be Democral, be 
Republican.

Is the American Empire already in decline? 



Is the American Empire already in declme? 
Just recently the New York Times began disciissing 
the American Empin3 (see the cover slory of 'The 
New York Times Magazine, Jan. 5). But it may be 
already in decline before most Americans realize 
its existence. Kevin Phillips thinks it is already in 

You Republicans must remember Kevin 
Phibps, he was the diief political analyst for Richard 
Nixon's presidential campaign of 196S. His pnrvi- 
ous best-seller, "The Politics of Rich and Poor," was 
national best-seller. In his most recent book. 



"Wealth and Democracy," Philips analyze 
empires of Spain during the 17lhcenhJry. the I 
Empire in the ISth century, British Empire of the 



ilth and polihcal power (plutocracy) and with 
mis comes the sltifl in tax burden to the poor and 
middle classes, rise of finance capital and markets 
driven by increasing speculation in monetary 
instruments, increasing government deficit spend- 
ing, decline of manufacturing base, corruptions of 
elites and increasing mililarizotion and warfare. 

There is much more lo his analysis tfian can 
be described here. II certainly makes thoughtful 
and troubling reading. Listen for a moment lo 
whatyouhearon Ihenews today Are you fiearing 
about increasing warfare and violence; government 
deficits and changing tax policies thai favor the 
wealthy; preoccupation with concerns about the 
stock marVel and investments; corruptions of Ihe 
elites and a continued loss of manufacturing jobs?

he anxiety reaches phobic 
proportions, causing the sufferer 
lo avoid all social situations.

social anxiety disorder was 
rarely diagnosed or heated even 
though it is highly prevalent 
and often has high direct and

third will be severely impaired. 

Ability to recognize 
signs of the disease and

junior by the name of Terry 
Collins. Mighty like Ihe oanther, 
Terry dominalcd most foes that 
stepped onto the courts as

along the river, a powerhouse 
senior known as Vernard

Although Dudley played

game against Texas-Pan

fought hard lo rally from 14

Dons lose starting center for remainder of season 



The IPFW men's basketball 
team suffered another setback 
Monday when the learn learned 
6'10" center and team scoring 
leader Jim Kessenich will not be 
able to play the rest of the year. 

Kessenich was diagnosed 
n enlarged 



spleen, a complicalion from a 
ailment thai caused him to miss 
Saturday's game al Illinois- 



"Tfli, 



o take ai

IPFW coach Doug Noll as lo Ihc 
severity of Ihe condition. 

Kessenich is nol a stranger 
tolheinjuij'bug He was hampered 



by leg injunes his sophomore year. 
'Jim IS taking il pretty hard, 
bul we exoect him to be healthy 
in time for spring practices," 
Noll added. 

The injury silualion lor the 
Dons was compounded by back 
problems experienced during 
Saturday's game by Kessentch? 
replacement Brandon Jennings. 

The Dons ivcre on a two-game 



vvinning streak before the injutiis

and when the IPFW 
volleyball team hosted No. 9 
Perm State on SalunJav it looked 
as if the Mastodons forgot that 
they loo were a top-15 team. 

The Dons starled slowly 
and dropped the first game, but 
rebounded to lake Game 2. 
However, IPFW never showed 
the desire and confidence it had 
shown earlier in the season, and 
the Dons were doivned by the 
Nittany Lions in four games at 
the Gates Center, 19-30, 30-3, 
29-31 and 23-30. 

"The team played with no 
heart," said IPFW coach Amie 
Ban, "We'i

in as many nights for Ihe Dons 
OS they won a tough four-game 
match over Findlay Friday 

According to Ball, the loss 
involved three key factors. "One 



i; Jeff [Ptak] because he hadn't 

Cracticed all week, and tivo was 
latt [Zbyszewski] because he 
hadn't pracliced all week. But 
the third factor was just the lack 
of menial sharpness in all of our 
players," 

IPFW (5-2) was led by Ptak 
wilh 19 kills and five digs, while 
2%yszewski had 14 Idlls and four 
blocks. Serdar Sikca added six 
kills, four aces and five blocks, 
and Dennis Santiago finished 
wilh j5 assists and six digs. 

In Ihe opening game, Ihe 
Dons got on the tioard first, but 
Penn State then scored the next 
six points to start a 21-S run. 
Thirteen of the 21 points were 
the result of IPFW errors. 

Behind the serves of Ptak 
and Sikca, IPFW then put 
together a 7-1 run to make Ihe 
score 22-16, but that was as close 
as the Dons could get and the 
Nittany Lions took the first 

"We told them that Penn 
State played as well as they're 
possibly capable of playing, and 



we olaycd as poorly as we're 
capable of playing [in Game I ]," 
Ball said. "All we told them was 
that they couldn't conhnue lo 

Klay that way and we just had to 
; patient, and that was certainly 
Irue. Thaf s exactly what happCT^d." 
IPFW never trailed in the 
second game. After building a 10-6 
lead. Ihc Dons stretched their lead 



lo seven poinls behind Uic service 
of Santiago. Moments later, IPFW 
held its largest lead al eight 
points following an ace by Sikca. 
Penn State then steadily 
closed the gap to 23-21 after a kill 
by Keith Kowal. A kill by Ptak 
ended the Nittany Lioru' charge.

fresh core of former high school 
standouts. 

Collins has been a standout 

Mastodon squad. In only 
averaging 25.8 minutes and 11.2 

Kints, Collins has contributed 
: lo IPFW. Thirty-six points in 
a Toss lo UC-Irvine and 29 in a 
big upset victory over lUPUl have 
topped Collins' performances. 

Hollins on Ihe olhcr hand 
has had the hot hand more than 
he has passed the ball- 
Averaging 36.6 minutes, Hollins 
is jusi under 20 a game at 19.1 
and ivas second in the Horizon 
League Conference in scoring lor 
nearly half of Ihe season. 

While Hollins has only hit 



the 30- point mark once, he has 
dropped 20 or more on 11 occa- 
sions and has scored less than 
double^igits only once: a nine 
point effort in a loss to Illinois- 
Chicago. 

Collins wishes he could say 
that. He's dropped over 20 only 
three times and has failed to 
reach double-digits in scaring 13 
times, including an embarrassing 
one point in a loss to Middle 
Tcrmessee Stale. 

Slalistically, Hollins should 
be the dominant of Ihe two. But 
when you enamine all of the 

fiertinent facts, it seems like 
PFW may have Ihe edge. 

You want a prediction? I'll 
give you one. In my eyes, IPFW 
ivill top Wright Slate, as HoUins 
will out-pertorm Collins, Wright 
Slate just doesn't seem lo be al 
the top of Iheir game and 1 think 
IPFW will lake advonlage of thai 
fact. However, my loyalties will 
always lie with 'Nard. 

And would my feelings be
