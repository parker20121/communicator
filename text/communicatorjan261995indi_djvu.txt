School fraternity aids child-care center 



Phi Kappa 
Theta 



By Melissa Young 
Staff Wrller 

Phi Kappa Theta (his week 
received the green light to proceed 
with planning lo repaint the child 
care center thai will open in the 
fall. 

"It was something thai stood 
out. It was a really big issue on 
campus at the time," said George 
Gounaris, Vice President of the Phi 



Kappa Thetas 
and director 
j^^^ v of the child 

J — l *C \ care philan- 
thropy. "It 
was one of the 
only issues 
really being 
stressed. 

The pro- 
ject has been 
in the works 
for four months. The fraternity 
involved had to take a series of 
steps just to be able 10 volunteer its 
services. "Initially to figure out 
how to get involved, I originally 
approached Marian Zimmerman, 



Gounaris 



dean of students. We had to check 
to see if it was a feasible goal," 
Gounaris said. 

According to Marian 
Zimmerman, dean of students and 
director of the Child Care Task 
Force, the goal for the center's 
opening day is the beginning of fall 
classes. "Obviously, the site has 
been picked oul We have a consul- 
tant coming out to see what needs 
to be done," Zimmerman said. "It is 
a huge job. They (the Phi Kappa 
Thetas) will do what they can and 
then the physical plant will do what 
they can." 

In order to obtain the funds to 
help, the Phi Kappa Thetas next 



had lo fill oul an application to 
receive the funds for the project. 
The firsi thing we had lo was fill 
out the Indiana Campus Compact 
for a mini grant. Then obtain 
approval from the collaborating 
organizations, Ihe physical plant 
and ihe Child Care Task Force." 
Gounaris said. 

Both faculty commitiees 
approved the proposal, bul the pro- 
posal for ihe funds had to be sent to 
the Indiana Campus Compact. 

"Mary Brunt, a member of Ihe 
Indiana compact assisted us in fill- 
ing out ihe application for the mini 
grant," Gounaris said. 

The final approval for funds 



reached Gounaris yesterday, and 
now ihe group is wailing for other 
repairs to be done so (hat ihcy can 
add some color to the building. 

In order lo be considered for ihe 
grant, the Phi Kappa The us had to 
meet several criteria. According to 
the Indiana Campus Compact 
(ICC) regulations, the applicants 
must be students of an ICC institu- 
tion and musi collaborate with a 
college or university, a primary or 
secondary school and be a nonprof- 
it organization. The group must 
also submit a letter of approval and 
must go to aid human need, public 
safety, environment or education. 

According lo the Phi Kappa's 



Theta 's applicalion, the need for the 
child care ccnier to be operational 
immediately is great According (o 
a 1990 Lilly Foundation study, the 
number one challenge for north- 
eastern parents who arc employed 
is child care. The application indi- 
cated lhai 60 percent of all IPFW 
siudenis are parents. 

Zimmerman hopes ihat as the 
project takes shape more groups 
will follow the Phi Kappa Theta's 
example. A list of needed equip- 
ment and supplies will be compiled 
soon. "Once we have that list, we 
will go around and see who could 
help in supplying some of (hose 
things," Zimmerman said.

Poignard has been director 
since IPFW founded the multi-

1987. 

Interim Director of Multi- 
cultural Services, Marcia Tapp- 
Sanders said, "When she came 



here eight years ago: she was 
Multi-cultural services." 

Tapp-Sanders added, "After six 
years under her, I feel at a loss." 

Frank Borelli. vice chancellor 
of student affairs, said, "She 
established one of the most suc- 
cessful early access programs in 
the state as well as in the country." 

"It's a real loss lo the campus," 
Borelli added.

Police chief 

explains skateboarding law 

Boarding, blading restricted 



By Angle Smith 
Staff Writer 

As of Jan. 1 , 1 995 a new skate 
boarding/rollerblading policy 
came into effect at IPFW. There 
have been some problems sur- 
rounding roller blading and skate 
boarding on campus. 

Such things as groups using 
campus after hours, like midnight 
lo 3 a.m., for recreation, roller 
blading and skate boarding in die 
parking garage, pushing emer- 
gency phones and running from 
police have been some of ihe 
problems thai ihe police have run 




Den Hartog 



cial affairs: 

•No skale boarding will be 
allowed in IPFW buildings or on 
IPFW grounds al any lime. 
•Roller blading/roller skating is 



prohibited in all areas of ihe IPFW 
campus between 11 p.m. and 7 
a.m. 

•No roller blading/roller skating 
will be allowed in any IPFW 
building, including the parking 
garage. 

•Roller blading/roller skating in 
heavily traveled pedestrian and 
vehicular areas will be restricted 
lo transportation purposes only. 
•The University Police will have 
the authority to suspend any roller 
blading/roller skaiing activities 
occurring on campus at their dis- 
cretion, if Ihere appears to be a 
chance for personal injury or 



property damage. 

There has been much concern 
over this issue. Lauren 
DenHanog,, chief of police, said, 
"1 realize that the parking garage 
would be fun to roller blade in, 
but there are so many blind spots 
that it is an accident waiting to 
happen. ..we don'l want injuries of 
any kind." 

Since ihere has been an 
increase of roller bladers and 
skate boarders on campus the 
Executive Cabinet feels this is the 
besl way to control the amount of 
personal injuries and property 
damage. 



Interna] Affairs chairman 
Jeffrey Valdez immediately ren- 
dered a decision not lo recom- 
mend sending the petition lo ihe 
Judicial Branch. 

Vice-President of Legislation 
Amy Steenman, said, "It's a dead 
issue." 

Chairman of Legislative 
Affairs Shawn Stanley said, 
"Valdez is the only one on the 
Internal Affairs commiuee; there 
should have been more people 
involved with ihe decision." 

When asked aboul the acceler- 
ated recommendation, King said 
Ihat he had asked Steenman to 
forward Adkins' petilion to the 
Internal Affairs committee while 
King was in Bloomington for 
Indiana University's birthday 
celebration. 

Valdez remarked, "There's 
nothing in the constitution aboul 
referendums; it's all concerned 
with elections." 

Adkins remarked, 'The judi- 
cial branch mediates all election 
disputes and this referendum as 
well as any other point or posi- 
tion voted on is an election." 

"The legislative branch has 
nothing lo do wilh this petition 
but they can do whatever ihey 
like," said Adkins. 

"To me, the respectful thing 
[IPSGA President) King should 
have done was lo send the peti- 
tion directly to ihe Judicial 
Branch," Stanley added. 

In response to Adkins' peti- 
tion. King said, "He's making a 
mountain out of a molehill and 
he's a fool." 

"Just because someone 
doesn't agree with Mark [King] 
Ihat does not make him a fool," 
replied Stanley. 

King officially retracted his 
comments on Tuesday, Jan. 24. 
In a statement released lo Dean 
of Students Marian Zimmerman, 
IPSGA, and the Communicator, 
King said, "Personal commenis 
are outside Ihe acceptable bound- 
aries of discourse and are not 
valid in ihe context of a senale 
meeting." 

Stanley and IPSGA senator 
Cecil Baker abstained from vot- 
ing on whether to send the peti- 
lion to ihe Judicial court 



Part of Ihe reason Stanley 
abstained was thai she said that 
she believed there was a conflict 
of interest within the Internal 
Affairs commiuee and Ihe presi- 
dent's office. 

"(King] is going to be Valdez' 
campaign manager for the forth- 
coming IPSGA presidential elec- 
tion," said 




Adkins 



seems very similar lo the referen- 
dum vote, very spur of the 
moment and I was nol represent- 
ed." 

"Another thing thai concerns 
me," said Adkins, "are the peo- 
ple who counted the votes were 
all proponents of Internet and the 
lechnology fee referendum." 

Stanley said that she thought 
the Inlemci information sessions 
were biased. "Mark IKing) held 
the information sessions. No one 
was sought from the other side of 
the issue," she added. 

Adkins remarked lhal King 
was only authorized by the 
IPSGA lo negotiate with the 
administration about Internet. 
Adkins said thai King failed to 
return with the final proposal for 
IPSGA approval. 

"I've had 20 or 30 students 
who had no idea about the elec- 
tion come up lo me and ask 
about it," said Adkins. "How can 
ihe students fully understand 
what happened when ihey had no 
knowledge about the referen- 
dum?" asked Adkins. 

According to a previous 
Communicator issue. King called 
the lechnology fee the leasl desir- 
able funding option for Internet. 
King has been concerned about 
the lechnology fee going through 
Purdue University because Iheir 
board of trustees must approve 
ihe fee and would exercise con- 
trol over the fees.

Athletics gets 
favored treatment 



The IPFW adminisiration 
recently changed its policy 
regarding travel. Under the new 
guidelines student groups cannot 
be reimbursed for travel - unless 
Ihey are members of a varsity 
sports team or unless they are on 
the forensics team. 

Why do ihese people get spe- 
cial treatment? As members of 
an IPFW sports learn they are 
representing the University. 
When other groups travel to 
national conferences they arc 
also representing the university. 
Not only are they gaining valu- 
able information thai might be 
used lo improve the university, 
they are also spreading IPFW's 
name. 

Some day an IPFW student 
might get a job because of a 
contact some other student made 
at a national conference. The 
University does not recognize 
these contacts as important. If 
they do, the administration is not 
willing to give students any 
travel reimbursements for these 
trips. However, the administra- 
tion Is willing lo give more and 
more money lo athletics. 

Every undergraduate who 



takes classes at IPFW pays 
$2.90 per credit hour in Student 
Activities Fees. Sixty percent of 
this fee goes to athletics. This 
semester approximately 

$241,000 were assessed in 
Student Activities fees. That 
means (hat this semester alone 
the athletics department got 
$144,600! 

What is this money used for? 
Some of it goes to the Gates 
Center, some of it goes for intra- 
mural sports, but a lot of it goes 
to the basketball and volleyball 
teams' travel expenses. 

How does this benefit the rest 
of the student body? What kind 
of return are they getting on 
their money? The overall the 
enue this department receives 
greatly surpasses its proportion- 
al benefil to the student body. 

Students do not have a choice 
about paying the Student 
Activities fees and normally

Country conned 
by mother's story 



Susan Smith conned us all. She 
had die entire country believing that 
her kids had been kidnapped and 
were in grave danger. How did she 
do this and why did wc believe her? 

She was a good actress. Not only 
did she go on national television, 
she cried and sobbed and pleaded 
for our mercy. Who wouldn't 
believe that kind of emotional 
appeal? No one stopped lo check 
out her story. Everyone was too 
busy looking for the kidnapper, 
except for the law enforcement 
authorities in her own town. No one 
listened to them though. What did 
ihey know? They were just the peo- 
ple dial had known her all her life. 
They knew what she was capable 
of. Had die people of this country 
been a little more careful about what 
Ihey believed, then maybe they 
would have figured out thai it was 
all a charade. 

Eventually she broke down and 
told ihe truth, but how many times 
does ihat happen? Once, maybe 
twice. How often do people get on 



national television and lie lo the 
country? Probably every day. 
Maybe not in the way Susan Smith 
did, but ihey do it ... and wc believe 

We see it and we believe it. 
Should we believe everything wc 
sec? Probably not. Fads and events 
can easily be distorted or misrepre- 
sented through the media. The pub- 
lic needs lo be aware of this. In this 
technological society informauon is 
disseminated before it can be veri- 
fied. Sometimes the mistakes are 
corrected. Sometimes ihey are not. 
Sometimes ihey weren't mistakes: 
ihey were lies. Susan Smith lied. 
Has Bill Clinton ever lied? What 
aboui Rush Limbaugh? 

In order to keep up with Ihe new 
information society people need to 
be more careful about what ihey 
believe. So the next time someone 
gets up on national television and 
pleads to die public, question their 
motives before accepting whai they 
say. It may turn out lhat they were 
lying all along.

Drinking: 

Drunks regret 
doing dumb things 



The agenda for some students 
this weekend probably include a 
trip to the bars and possibly a party 
at a friend's, or maybe jusi a few 
beers with the guys (or gals). 

Most likely some of these activi- 
ties will include a large amount of 
alcohol. Even if this is not some- 
thing you do every weekend, you 
know what I am talking about. 

First of all I have to tell you that 
1 would be lying if I said I never 
drink. The fact that I drink makes 
what I have to say all the more irue. 
I am speaking from personal experi- 
ence. 

As a full-time student I realize 





(hat it is

have 



onymous with "get drunk." 
"Did you have a good time?" 
"Yeah, I was pretty buz2ed." 
Why have we reverted to drink- 
ing? 

Whether we realize it or not, il is 
a great escape mechanism. We use 
it to forget about the pressures of 
exams, or the stresses of our busy 
schedules. We use it to ignore diffi- 
cult situations, like the girlfriend or 
boyfriend problems we are having. 

Finally, wc use it to fit in. If 
everyone is inebriated no one will 
notice our inability. 

The incredible thing is, we do 
not even question its acceptability. 
If a friend says he is not going to 
drink, and then does he is not dumb. 
He is cool. 

Although people think it is cool 
lo drink, they do not think it is cool 
lo admit they are drunk, and ii is 
definitely noi cool to admit that

they are too drunk to drive home! 

I know, because I am sure 1 have 
done it myself, especially here in 
Fort Wayne where ihe bars are 
rarely within walking distance. 

So what do people do? They go 
to the bars, get drunk and end up 
endangering their lives and every- 
one else's on the road by driving 
drunk. 

Now, as if drunk driving is not 
bad enough in itself, people do real- 
ly stupid things when ihey are 
drunk and they think ii is cool. 

I would jusi like lo point out 
some of the things that elude me 
about people's treatment of alcohol 
and their actions when they are 
drunk. 

First of all. what is the point in 
going out and having ihe lime of 
your life if you do not remember 
what you did? 

Months or even years later we 
may look back on our wedding 
night and wish we could remember 
what we did after we left the recep- 
tion. 

Second, why do we find it 
strange when we are out at a bar 
with a friend who normally drinks, 
but has chosen noi to drink? 

I go out to see friends, meet new 
people and listen lo music. I find 
this much easier lo do when I can 
stand up and enunciate clearly. 

Third, why do we accept drunk 
people's actions when we would 
reject ihose same actions by a sober 
person? 

If I was out at O'Sullivan's and 
got up on the bar stone sober and 
started taking my domes off people 
would think I was an exhibitionist 
and probably have me taken lo the 
nut farm. If I did this after drinking 
three pitchers of beer, people would 
laugh and joke about how much I 
had drunk and how I would wonder 
where my bra was in the morning. 

Finally, why do we go out drink- 
ing when we know we are going to 
wake up in the morning, grab our 
bottle of ibuprofen and rush (o the 
window to make sure our car is in 
one piece? 

I know there are a million and 
one excuses for drinking and the sit- 
uations we gel ourselves into when 
we are drunk. Everyone has said or 
heard a friend say things like: "I 
didn't really mean to get so drunk." 
"No really. 1 always remember 
everything, even when 1 am drunk," 
and "I drive beuer when I am 
drunk." 

When it comes right down to it 
getting drunk is dumb and ii is a lie. 
The only people we are fooling are 
ourselves. So take my advice: do 
not drink too much and if you do. 
do not drive. 



Homosexually Speaking: 

Can long distance relationships work? 



When I started daUng, I made 
a list of criteria thai my dream 
husband musi have. He had to be 
employed, be humorous, prefer- 
ably a non-smoker, and be some- 
what attractive (yeah, I know 
how superficial that one is). Most 
importantly, he had to live in my 
vicinity, I bad no faith in long 
distance relationships. I have 
c e 



"T* ~ 1 


changed my 
mind and I 
would like 
to explain 
what 
brought me 
to this con- 
clusion. 

Many 
people I 
know have 


Paul 
Tupper 



through dozens of relationships 
lhat only last two weeks. I too 
have fallen viclim to this practice. 
I can not answer for others who 
have bad problems keeping a 
relationship going, but I have a 
theory for my difficulties. I gel 
attached too quickly. When I 
meet Mr. Wonderful, I can not 
seem io think of anything else 
and I want to spend every waking 
moment with him. Does this 
sound familiar lo any of you? 

Everyone knows it is wise to 
start off slowly when beginning a 
new relationship. It is difficult lo 
do when you live in the same 
city. Things lend to move faster 
lhan they should and you are 
tempted to overstep certain 
boundaries. You may even sleep 
with this new mate sooner than 
you really want to. Well, this is 
whai consistendy happens io me. 

Although I am an open minded 
liberal who believes lhat people 
should do what bcsl works for 
them, I appreciate ihe old-fash- 



ioncdway of waiting until the 
right moment to get physical with 
a new partner. When you have 
sex with someone so early in a 
relationship, il is like starting in 
the middle and the end is lhat 
much closer. 

Dating someone who lives an 
hour or iwo (or even three) away 
can help prevent such a rushing 
of events. With today's busy 
lifeslyles, it is not easy lo drop 
school, work and job responsibili- 
ty to trek a few hours lo sec that 
new love. This enables you to 
talk more via telephone. letters or 
E-mail. Anyone who has ever 
seen a talk show about relation- 
ships knows that communication 
is the key to a successful reladon- 
ship. Distance can force commu- 
nication onto an early-in-dcvelop- 
ment relationship. With this com- 
munication, you can explore each 
others' Jives and minds before 
you explore each others' bodies. 

Another reason why I think 
long distance relationships are 
good is because we as college 
students need to stay focused on 
our sludies. This is not easy lo do 
if we are being tempted to set 
aside our responsibilities lo be 
with a lover. Of course I would 
rather be with my boyfriend than 
studies, but I can also use dis- 
tance lo keep me from neglecting 
my education. 

So. needless to say. I am back 
io where I started from. Because I 
ihink being picky about who I 
date is a good thing, I still have a 
list of criteria my dream husband 
must follow. He still must be 
employed, be humorous, prefer- 
ably a non-smoker and be some- 
what attractive. But I am not 
going to let a little thing like a 
two hour drive keep me from 
something lhat could be wonder- 
ful.

Students happier as homosexuals 

This is America and everyone 
has a right to voice his or her opin- 
ions, but I am getting tired of bear- 
ing devoutly religious people say 
that homosexuals will not go to 
Heaven because of tbeir chosen 
lifestyle. First of all, homosexual 
feelings are not a choice, though 
sexual behavior may be. 
Homosexuals, who are sexually 
active with someone of the same 
gender, are only following their 
hearts. I am sure that some homo- 
sexuals deny their feelings in favor 
of "the socially correct thing to do." 



They are probably miserable too. 

I, for one, was miserable trying 
to fit into the heterosexual commu- 
nity, bui did not realize why until I 
fell in love with one of my best 
friends. I have never been happier' 
Maybe getting into Heaven should 
be die most important thing to me, 
but I have been miserable for twen- 
ty-five years and I bave finally 
found what makes me happy by fol- 
lowing my bean. I cannot and will 
not apologize for that!

Democrats doing a good job despite opposition 



The rcceni election has given 
: the Republican Parly a majority of 
leaU in both houses of Congress. 
This majority, which is just over 
one -half in both the House and the 
Senate, has sent signals that the 
days of the Democrats have 
ended, soon to be replaced by the 
; voters' mandate for Republican 
leadership. However, the current 
. president, a democrat, still has the 
; power to veto legislation. This 
: veto can only be overridden with a 
iwo-thirds vole, something (he 
Republicans do not have. Thus, 
the potential for two more years of 
legislative gridlock seems very 
high. 

If any substantial legislative 
action is to be accomplished, leg- 
islative leaders and the President 
must be willing to find compro- 
mise on many diverse issues. I 
have been disappointed so far to 
hear some of the so-called leaders 
of the Republican Party make 
strong statements indicating their 
unwillingness to compromise. 
Since the legislative members of 
the Democratic Parly were elected 
: by American voters, I equate this 
'with an unwillingness by these 



Republicans to cooperate with 
other American's whose views 
they oppose. 

However, I see much potential 
for positive action from President 
Clinton. He has conducted himself 
well in response to some rather 
immature and out of place 
remarks made by other 
Republicans soon after the elec- 
tion. When Newt Gingrich rather 
viciously proclaimed that the 
Republicans now rale Congress, 
the President didn't attack 
Gingrich or the Republican Party. 
In response he casually smiled 
and acknowledged this as a politi- 
cal fact that he will deal with. 
When Senator Helms made his 
very inappropriate comment about 
the President's security. President 
Clinton chose not to verbally 
attack him. responding instead in 
a manner which served to preserve 
the integrity of the office of the 
President of the United States. His 
immediate responses have shown 
that he will not allow some imma- 
ture remarks made by the 
Republicans to degrade his posi- 
tion. 

Clinton has put himself on a

I have noticed that Gingrich has 
received a lot of, personal criticism 
fromihe media and his democratic 
opponents. Someone who docs not 
like him please tell me what he 
plans to do that is so bad. The focus 
lately, has been on his personal life

Whenever a public figure's poti-

said last year, "There is something 
bothersome about The New York 
Times placing on Page One a cock- 
tail lounge meeting between two 
political consultants, while the cov- 
erage of a debate on issues between 
the two candidates themselves bare- 
ly makes the same newspaper." 

People who have been in control 
for a long time are now trying to 
deal with a serious change taking 
place in the way the country will be 
run in the next few years. They are 
on an ego trip because they think 
the new group will discard the old 
set of mistaken policies which have 
been in place for the last threc-and- 
a-half decades. 

The leftist media has time and 
again haichcted the reputations of 
those politically and economically 
conservative polidcians or hopefuls 
to the point those people are no 
longer clectible. Just look at Dan 
Quayle. 



level above the Republicans, first 
by refusing to engage them in 
childish and unproductive verbal 
assault, then by actually finding 
and declaring what he considers to 
be Iheir good points. Instead of 
viewing the Republicans as ene- 
mies because seven of the ten 
points proclaimed in their 
"Contract with America" are not 
on his agenda, he has made it 
known that he would like to work 
with them to accomplish the three 
points where they might find an 
agreement. The President and 
members of Congress should 
cooperate to find solutions rather 
than behave as enemies, and I 
believe President Clinton is show- 
ing his willingness to do so. 

I think the American people 
want legislative reform. We want 
welfare reform, budget reform, 
and we want an effective govern- 
ment. I also think most Americans 
can respect the position of some 
extremist politicians. Even though 
I want government health care, I 
am glad that Senator Dole will 
fight to make sure that it will not 
pass if it will bankrupt our country 
or degrade the quality of service. 



They arc attempting to do it 
again to Gingrich, and to a lesser 
extent, to other Republicans who 
agree with him. 

It is ironic thai the media at large 
is attacking the person who wants 
the government to become more 
open to the mass media. 

If the democrats were able to ran 
the country better, why did the pub- 
lic vote them out? Also, why are the 
media and the nation's intelligentia 
set on fighting with the nation's 
newly elected leaders. 

The old school politicians need 
to allow the new Congress to func- 
tion. Perhaps they can make head- 
way in looking at the problems all 
politicians have slated are targeted 
for elimination. The present failing 
policies obviously need to bi, 
replaced. 

Government programs which 
were aimed ai decreasing the pover-

Kennedy will fight to make sure it 
does not pass if it violates funda- 
mental human dignities or will 
cause greater social problems. 
However, when the issues are 
finally brought down to costs, and 
they are arguing over whether 
national health care will cost a

don't give a damn so long as they

It is important to keep in mind 
that the President of the United 
States is not explicitly granted 
legislative powers. The Senate 
and the House of Representatives 
are assigned this role. However, it 
must be realized that the president 
holds the persuasion over the 
process. Some past presidents 
have tried and failed, yet others 
have merely fulfilled the execu- 
tive role, giving little attention to 
legislative matters. The truly great 
presidents, I believe, were the 
ones who carefully scanned the 
political environment, assessed 
various elements, then formed and 
suggested solutions which could

In search of .•. the best peanut butter 



Kara Whlling 
Features Editor 

Okay boys and girls, this week 
I am featuring peanut butler Yes. 
that ail-American food that we 
grew up with and turn to when we 
need to feel young again. 
Personally I love peanut butter 
and therefore would lake a pb&amp;j 
sandwich over anything any day. 
While I was thinking about peanut 
butter, I decided to go to my cor- 
ner grocery and find the best 
peanut butler out ihere. 

1 found six brands and as it 
turned out, the best was actually 
the one I grew up with. Just so 
you know, i stuck with creamy. 
The crunchy can be saved for 
another week. The rating system 
for this week is peanuts. One 
peanut is not worth your lime. 



Two peanuts are okay, but some- 
thing is missing. Three peanuts 
are great, but could have been a 
little belter. Four peanuts are per- 
fect. 

Let the games begin!! 

SKIPP Y PEANUT BUTTER 

They certainly knew what they 
were doing when they named this 
sorry excuse for a peanut butter. 
The makers definitely skipped 
some ingredient when they came 
up with this recipe. This peanut 
butter is very thin and dry. It also 
has this terrible buttery taste that 
is kind of annoying. For two 
tablespoons you get 17 grams or 
fat and 190 calories. (Yeah, really 
skippy on the fat count). If I were 
to go on, 1 think I would cry it 
lasted so bad. For this one I was 



thinking of giving it less than one 
peanut, but 1 will be nice and give 
in a half of a peanut. Don't ever 
say I wasn't nice. 

REESE'S PEANUT BUTTER 

This fine peanut butter was 
delicious. 1 loved it. It was thick 
and tasty. I fell as though 1 was 
really tasting the peanuts them- 
selves. The down side was the 
dryness of this peanut butter, and 
for every serving size (two table- 
spoons), there were 16 grams of 
fat and 200 calories. Yikes! Other 
than my hips expanding another 
five feet, 1 liked this peanut butter 
a lot. (Where was it when 1 was 
seven?) Reese's Peanut Butler 
receives three -and-a-half peanuts 
oui of a possible four, 



JIF PEANUT BUTTER 

This creamy peanut buiter did 
have a nutty taste but was missing 
something. It was not loo dry 
either. But again for only two 
tablespoons it has 16 grams of fat 
and 190 calories! Help me!! 1 
never did like Jif when I was little 
and I guess I siill do not like it 
today. So based on my previous 
dislike for this peanui buiter 1 give 
Jif ihrec peanuis oui of four. I 
know ii is not fair, but who ever 
said life was fair? 

SHOPPERS VALUE 
PEANUT BUTTER 

Here we go again with good 'ol 
Shoppers Value. Well. 1 could be 
nice and nol say anything bad 
about this peanut bulier, but then 
this would be my only sentence. 



First of all. it did not taste like 
peanut bulier. It was kind of artifi- 
cial, and my taslebuds taste right 
through this artificial flavor. On 
the bright side it was thick, but 
wait unnl I tell you how many fal 
grams and calories you can con- 
sume with this tasteless peanut 
buiter. Seventeen grams of fat and 
220 calories for a iwo tablespoon 
serving! Insane! This imitation 
receives a half of a peanui this 
week. 

PETER PAN PEANUT 
BUTTER 

This is the one I grew up with 
and 1 love my mother for it. Peter 
Pan tastes like real peanuis. It is 
perfect. It is not dry ai all. It has a 
nice thick consistency and has a 
low calorie count. What more 



could you ask for? For a serving 
of iwo tablespoons you consume 
16 grams of fat and 130 calories. 
Not loo bad. 1 strongly suggest 
you switch peanui bulier right 
now if you do not already use 
Peter Pan. liisihebestl 

FXAVORITE PEANUT 
BUTTER 

As expected this peanut buiter 
was preuy good. At least this one 
has a real peanutly laste. The 
weird thing was the after laste. It 
was so, so strange. It was thick 
and not too dry which made up for 
the weird aftertaste. The calorie 
and fal count for this one is as fol- 
lows: 220 calories and 18 grams 
of fat. Oh dear! A final rating for 
the Flavorilc peanut bulier is two- 
and-a-half peanuis oui of four.

"To err is human" as I 
always say. And I am sorry to dis-

tences later, 1 wrote that the movie 
would be rated based on stars. I 
apologize for this. Ii is supposed lo 
be Junior Mints.

Columbia Street West: 

A look at the Fort Wayne bar scene 



Paul Tupper 
Features Writer 

Mosi of ihe greater campuses 
across this great nation have a des- 
ignated bar where almost ail of the 
students meet. Never having heard 
that wc had such a campuswidc 
acknowledged place to meet, I took 
it upon myself to find the best, 
most collegiate bar to go to. This 
scries is a report of my findings. 

COLUMBIA STREET WEST 

I decided to start with Columbia 
Street West only because I have 
heard many great things about it 
from my friend Jeff Tyler, a student 
majoring in Anthropology. When 
wc walk the campus together, he is 
constantly being stopped by a fel- 
low Columbia patron and they talk 
endlessly about what a great time 
they had the weekend past and 
when they arc going to meet there 
again. It was this that sparked my 
curiosity. 

It is apparent upon entering 
Columbia Street why people have a 
great time here. The moment you 
enter, you arc enthusiastically wel- 



comed by Brent Macintosh, a 
junior majoring in English and by 
Cory Borsberding, a junior major- 
ing in Civil Engineer Technology. 
They take your money with a "Hey. 
glad you can join Ihe party!" atti- 
tude. If working at such a great bar 
wasn't enough, both Brent and 
Cory say that when ibey arc not 
working, Columbia Street is the 
place they like to go. 

The main attraction of the bar is 
the live entertainment. Every 
weekend, the bar features area and 
national acts who play a variety of 
music. Reggae is one of the most 
popular forms of music enjoyed at 
Columbia Street However, accord- 
ing to Brent, the most popular band 
in Indiana is a group named Real 
Eyes, and they will be performing 
at the club Jan. 28. 

Once you get past the doormen, 
you are thrown into a sea of 
"partiers," My only discomfort so 
far is the space between the crowd- 
ed bar and the equally crowded 
seating area. The limited space 
makes it difficult to travel to the 
back room of the establishment 



where the band plays. Of course, I 
may be missing the whole point. 
Maybe being so close to other bod- 
ies is what is intended? 

The back bar is much roomier 
and can be traversed with ease. The 
stage is big enough for the band to 
play comfortably, but small enough 
to promote an aura of intimacy. 
Jennifer O'Blenis, 21, is at 
Columbia Street "because of the 
band.. .and to show my friend (who 
just became of drinking age) the 
ropes." 1 have heard that Piere's 
features live entertainment, but 
according to Jennifer, "Piere's is 
not happening tonight, or any 
night. The music is better here." 

A friend of Jennifer's, Jeff 
Roussey, an IPFW graduate of 
Engineering, agrees with her. He 
goes to Columbia Street to "have 
fun." Jeff is comfortable at this bar, 
but he has one complaint. "It's 
great the way it is, but they need 
belter restrooms." 

The manager of the bar, Scott 
Miller is also an IPFW student, 
Miller, a senior majoring in Civil 
Engineering Technology, believes 



that there are many reasons why 
Columbia Street is such a success. 
"It's not a meal market kind of 
place. It's very laid back." 1 was 
not suprised when he said this 
because the crowd had a friendly, 
party attitude, not a "let's sec who I 
can lake home tonight" altitude. 

The collegiate atmosphere can 
also be credited with the choice of 
bands Miller books. He lends to 
follow die bookings of the bars of 
Bloomingion. "What works in 
Bloomington usually works here," 
Scott says. Bui "collegiaie" is a 
word Miller would ralher not use to 
describe Columbia Street. Instead 
he says it is the "most realistic" of 
the bars in the area 

My overall feeling of the bar is 
very positive and I can honestly 
say that Columbia Street West is a 
place I would like to go again. It is 
a club where what is important is 
that you be pretly on ihe inside, not 
necessarily on the outside. For the 
rest of this series, il is going to be 
tough lo compare other bars to this 
one.

Features Editor 

This week's pick for a movie 
to view in a theater Is "Little 
Women." This sweet story about 
four girls is a truly wonderful 
flick to see. 1 strongly recom- 
mend this film. In last week's 
review, I accidently wrote that 
Jo was the oldest, but it was 
really Meg. Oops! 

This week's pick for a movie 
to rent is "Singles." This great, 
almost realistic look at dating 
and being single is perfect 
because it not only Is funny, but 
It is also a film most of us can 
relate to. 

This week's pick for a great 
novel to pick up and read is Kurt 
Vonnegut's "God Bless You, Mr. 
Roscwater." This funny novel 
written by Indiana's own 
Vonnegut is a great book that 
makes you laugh at life and 
what ever else comes to mind. 

Last, but certainly not least. 



the CD of the week: "Liz Phair: the anger, the passion, the every- 
Exile in Guyville." This CD is a thing in a woman's life. I highly 
personal look at women and recommend this CD to any one.

St. Joe stuffs 'Dons 

Pumas claw way 
to victories at home 



By S. Brant Kelley 
Edllor-ln-ChIef 

The IPFW men's and women's 
basketball teams played two games 
against the Si. Joseph's University 
Pumas at the Alumni Ficldhouse in 
Rensselaer. They relumed 0-2. 

SJU defeated the Lady 'Dons, 
106-86, in a high-scoring game 
improving its conference mark to 
5-1. IPFW dropped to 1-5 and 7-7 
overall. 

"It was a real hard game to 
play... they couldn't gci in ihe 
rhythm." commented IPFW coach 
Pam Bowdcn. 

Forward Jennie Newhard said 
the team started out slow. "Toward 
(he end we were working a lot 
harder. We. .were down by too 
much." she said. "We didn't con- 
tain the drive very well, eilher," 
added guard Wendy Rccker. "We 
did well... breaking Ihe press." 

The Lady 'Dons spotted the 
Lady Pumas a 44-37 lead, ihen 
were ouiscorcd 62-49 in the second 
balf in the blowout. IPFW shoi 37 
percent from the field. The Lady 
Pumas hit 58 perceni of its field- 
goal attempts. 

Wendy Rccker led five double- 
figure scorers for IPFW with 19 
points on 7-for-15 field-goal shoot- 
ing and by hitting 3-of-5 from the 
free-throw line. Newbard added 18 
while center Tara Muzzillo 
grabbed a game-high 11 rebounds. 



Guard Siacie Shepherd scored 
25 to lead the Lady Pumas. SJU 
placed 11 players into the scoring 
column. 

Both teams hauled in 43 
rebounds and turned the ball over 
more than 20 times. Both teams 
combined for 86 free-throws dur- 
ing the game. 

The 'Dons eniered Alumni 
Fieldhousc wilh a 3-2 GLVC 
record. SJU defeated IPFW 72-66 
in a close game in which 17 play- 
ers saw double-figure minutes. 

IPFW coach Andy Piazza said 
he thought the 'Dons were in the 
game until the last two minutes. 

Freshman Jason Wcrling scored 
15 points to lead nine 'Dons in the 
scoring column. IPFW shot only 
39 percent from the field, including 
6-of-20 from long range. 

St. Joe Forward Kevin Denson 
led the game with 19 points on the 
strength of 8-of-10 field-goal 
shooting. The Pumas hit 57 percent 
of their Field-goal attempts while 
raising their record (o 2-4 in the 
GLVC. They also shot 33 free 
throws to JPFW's 17. 

SJU out rebounded IPFW 37- 
26. but turned the ball over 19 
limes; ihe more stingy 'Dons only 
gave it away II limes. Piazza stal- 
ed he wanted IPFW to bit ibe 
boards harder. 

Guard Jeff Jackson said they 
didn't rebound very well.

Men crash and burn 



By George Thomas 
Staff Writer 
end S. Brant Kelley 
Editor-in-Chief 

The IPFW men's and women's 
basketball learns traveled lo ibe 
Kennedy Sports Center at 
Romeovllle. 111. for a pair of games 
againsi the Lewis University Flyers. 

The Lady 'Dons won their 
malchup with Lewis University on 
Jan. 21. 101-78. In the first balf, 
IPFW outscored Lewis 51-37, and 
the second half, ihe Lady 'Dons beat 
Lewis 50-41. 

"I think our kids wanted to win," 
said IPFW coach Pam Bbwden. She 
added having the game's first lead 
was a nice change of pace. 

For IPFW. ihe high scorers of the 
game were Leah Shcels. who scored 
15, wilh 6 out of 7 field goals made, 
3 out of 4 free-throws and she col- 
lected 6 defensive rebounds. Tara 
Muzzillo added 14, hitting 7-of-9 
from the field, to go with 8 
rebounds. 

IPFW shot 55 percent from ihe 
field for the first half, and 66 perceni 
during ihe second half, for a game 
average of 60 percent. The Lady 
'Dons hit six or 10 (hree-poini 
attempts, and 17 of 18 free throws. 

IPFW point guard Wendy Recker 
said, "1 think we played great that 
game." 

Bowdcn required ihe learn to 
make a least five passes on each pos- 
session on offense. "I think thai real- 
ly helped us out." said IPFW guard 
Lindy Jones. 

Brenda Wcgrzyn, center, led 
Lewis with 22 points on 8-of-12 
field goal shooiiog, 6-of-9 free 



throws and eight rebounds. Guard 
Joy King added 20 points 

In men's basketball action, the 
'Dons dropped their match to Lewis 
by Ihe score of 62-74. IPFW coach 
Andy Piazza, referring also to the 
Jan. 19 game againsi St. Joe 
University, said the 'Dons were in 
both games until the final two min- 
utes. 

Both teams struggled offensively 
in the first half and the 'Dons spotted 
Lewis a 28-25 lead. Forward Jason 
Burkbart said, "We weren'i ready to 
play either game." referring also to 
the game against St. Joe. 

For IPFW, the best performers 
were Jason Werling, wilh 12 total 
pouits. 4-of-8 from the field, and 4 
out of 6 on free throws. Kyle Kirby 
turned in the next-highest scoring 
show, wilh 10 total points 3-for-9 
field-goal shooting and 4 oui of 5 
free throws. 

The 'Dons shot 38 percent from 
the field. Said Piazza, "If our shoot- 
ing gels more consistent, we will be 
able to compeie (in the GLVC)." 

Good shows by Lewis were 
turned in by Dave Groharing and 
Scott Hasenjaeger. Groharing led ihe 
Flyers with 16 total points, hitting 5- 
for-12 from the field, 5-of-8 free 
throws and grabbing 10 rebounds. 
Hasenjaeger added 14 points. He 
shot 5-for-8 from ibe field and 0-for- 
2 on free throws. 

The Flyers hit 43 percent of their 
field goals and out rebounded the 
'Dons 41-31. 

Jeff Jackson said. "I think our 
intensity level was higher in the St. 
Joe game than it was against Lewis. I 
don't think our confidence was real 
high. ..we kind of came oui slow." 



Volleydons get spiked 



By S. Brant Kelley 
Editor-in-Chief 

IPFW hosied ihe Fort Wayne 
National Bank/Pepsi Invitational 

volleyball tournament on Jan. 20 and 
Jan. 21. Ohio Stale University 
(OSU), the University of Manitoba 
fUM), IPFW and George Mason 
University (GMU) played four 
games among (hem at the Gates 
Center. 

UM defeated the Buckeyes 17- 
15. 15-3. 15-17 and 15-9 in a lop- 
sided maich. Despite Ihe way his 
team dominated the match, Manitoba 
coach Gathe Pischke did not praise 
his team's performance. 

Pischke's comment, "I wasn't 
real happy wilh our play. ..I thought 
we were very inconsistent, especially 
our service reception. We would 
have been a little more dominant if 
we would have pass served a lot bet- 
ter, but our iwo outside hiners...had 
some irouble." He was glad some of 
his reserve players performed well in 
the game when Ihey played in place 
of the starters. 

OSU started playing even with 
the Bisons until late in the first 
game. Manitoba, the number one- 
ranked team in Canada, then took a 
three-point lead before OSU came 
back to even the score at I5-all. UM 
finally won ihe firsi game 17-15. 

UM dominated ihe second game, 
15-3, mainly on athletic ability and 
good passing. OSU came back lo 
win the third game. 17-15, on a good 
deal of emotion. UM returned to the 
fourth game wilh a vengeance and 
won, 15-9. 

Jules Martens led the Bisons with 
25 kills; Stephen Welch added 19. 
UM hit for a 31 perceni kill percent- 
age. Setter Scott Koskie assisted 66 
kills. 

Five Buckeyes recorded double- 
figures in kills, and the team killed 
25 percent of iis attempts. Adam 
Spitznagle accounted for all 69 OSU 
assists. 

In the second match, the 
Volleydons served first to GMU and 
jumped out to a 4-0 lead. After sev- 
eral more exchanges, the 'Dons led 
6-2, Ihen the Patriots came back to 
lie the score at six. A see-saw battle 
ensued uniil GMU pulled out to a 9- 
7 lead. 

IPFW showed its youthfulness as 
the 'Dons buili an early lead in each 
game (o have the Patriots come back 
to win each time. Said JPFW coach

nities to score in games iwo and 
three... I thought they served real 
well. You look at the serving errors." 
He labeled the breakdown late in 
each game as a lack of leadership. 

He also thought die 'Dons didn't 
handle ihe first contact wilh the ball 
well when GMU served. 

GMU built Ihe lead lo 14-8 as 
service errors killed IPFW's chances 
at a comeback in the game; Craig 
Collins came up with five clutch 
kills in GMU's 5-1 run which could 
have been more productive. GMU 
won ihe game 15-9. 

IPFW began serve again in the 
second game and started wilh leads 
of 3-1 and 4-2, but GMU went on an 
8-3 scoring spurt to lead 10-7 before 
IPFW coach Amie Ball called a lime 
oui. GMU then built the lead to 12-7 
before IPFW came back to lie the 
game at 12 and again at 14 points 
each. However, GMU Ihen scored 
the last two points of that game to go 
up in ihe match 2-0. 

Manitoba coach Pischke said 
afier the second game between 
IPFW and GMU he liked both Felipe

Ralai and Craig Collins as hitters. 

The third game started with 
IPFW coming oui slow. GMU came 
oui to a 5-4 lead before the 'Dons 
reeled off four straight points to lead 
8-5. GMU responded by scoring 
three poinis of their own, tying Ihe 
game at eight poinis and again at 
nine. 

IPFW ihen jumped to an 11-9 
lead before GMU scored five 
straight for a 14-11 lead. From here 
IPFW look over wilh three more 
points of its own for a 14-all tie. The 
Pairiols, however, scored ihe last 
two for the game and the match, 15- 

9, 16-14,16-14. 

IPFW recorded a better kill per- 
centage lhan the Patriots, 26 percent 
to 23 percent. Collins and Ralai both 
recorded 20 kills and Scotl Lauer 
assisied 67 times. IPFW had 19 ser- 
vice errors compared to GMU's six. 

All-iournameni selection Mike 
Mauro led GMU with 20 kills. 

GMU coach Ron Shayka said he 
did noi think eilher team was out- 
standing, but the Patriots passed well 
and that was the difference. "I don't 
think either team felt really comfort- 
able lonight... if I had to think of one 
area that I thought we did pretty 
well, lhal was service. The passing 
went preity well,". 

GMU middle blocker Jason Stang 
concurred. He stated, "I thought a 
key to it right now is our passing and 
our outside hitting worked real well 
today." 

IPFW setter Scott Lauer said the 
'Dons were not consistent at siding 
out, and he thought he did not do 
particularly well. "I wasn't setting 
the ball in a consistent spot," he said. 

Teammate Collins agreed with 
Ball. He said, "It goes back to lead- 
ership... he's right." 

On Saturday night, OSU lost lo 
GMU 8-15. 15-11, 13-15 and 2-15 to 
drop its record to 2-3. OSU coach 
Pete Hanson could not be reached 
for comment. 

Mauro led the Patriots with 25 
kills on a 49 percent kill efficiency. 
Setter Eric Olson assisied 55 kills. 
GMU dug 42 balls altogether. 

OSU was led by McCanls and 
Mihacevich wilh 14 kills each. The 
Buckeyes' kill percentage was only 
.179. Spitznagle contributed 47 

GMU coacb Shayka said after the 
match, "I though] Ohio State served 
preity tough; last night, we passed 
pretty well and thai held us in. We 
had some breakdown in our passing 
tonight.. .we gave up some poinis in 
bunches." 

In the night's second match, UM 
pummeled the Volleydons 15-2, 15- 

10, 15-5. 

Before the match. Bison coach 
Pischke said his learn would need to 
keep the ball away from IPFW's 



center to have a good chance to win. 

"I'm looking forward to it 
because, jusl the emotion that is 
going to be involved in ihe match is 
going to be a little more lo our bene 
fit," he said. He added he Ihoughi 
IPFW would be stronger opposition 
for his team's second maich then 
OSU was. 

Welch of Ihe Bisons agreed 
"This icam has a couple of belter 
athletes . some good jumpers." He 
added ihe Volleydons would be 
stronger at the net than OSU was. 
"They're a good hilling learn." 

The Bisons came oui ready to 
play and jumped on the Volleydons. 
UM was spotted leads of 4-1 and 6- 
2, then outscored IPFW 9-0 the rest 
of the way. 

IPFW made a better showing in 
the second game, scoring the first 
point ihen putting together their first 
2 point run when behind, 6-2 tp.make 
the scoitCi 6t4. They got hoi again 
later in the game to come within 13- 
10. However, ihe 'Dons fell 15-10 in 
the second game. 

During that match, IPFW Coach 
Amie Ball got inio a brief argument 
with Ihe far-side official about a call 
he did noi think the official could 
sec. 

IPFW fell apart during ihe third 
game wilh five service errors. The 
'Dons had only a 15 percent kill 
raiio. Pischke said "We're a hard 
team to score againsi." 

Ralai ended the match with 15 
kills ai 41 perceni. Collins added 14 
kills, and setter Mike Lauer assisted 
34 kills altogether. "I thought 
(Felipe) played real well... consider- 
ing he hasn'i practiced all week. He 
really showed some strong leader- 
ship." 

Ralat said before the game that 
Ball did noi intend to make any 
changes for the match against UM, 
but better execution was the key, (o 
avoiding service errors, especially. 
He also staled the Bisons were a 
deeper team than GMU's squad. 
Ball, however, said he tried to move 
two players to lake advantage of 
their strong sides. 

When asked for a brighi spot in 
Ihe match, IPFW swing hitter 
Ricardo Soler said, "We didn't do 
anything betier." He said he thought 
the team would work especially on . 
passing and serving in the coming 
week. "We don't pass and we don't 
serve, we're not going to win." 

Pischke said after ihe game he 
thought they played belter against 
IPFW lhan against OSU. "I though! 
we had something to prove. ..we 
were not happy wilh our effort (last 
night)." 

Ball still was not impressed with 
IPFW's offense, particularly serving.! 
even though he ihought UM played 
well.

Tonight, The KWU men's team 
comes to town with a 12-3 record, 6-

ranking. Last year, the Panthers fin- 
ished in a tie for second place in the 



ihis week for two games each against GLVC with St. Joseph's University 
Kentucky Wesleyan University with a 13-5 record, 23-7 overall. 
(KWU) and University of Southern The Panthers return senior all- 
Indiana (USI). GLVC player Willis Cheaney from 



last year and will also feature for- 
ward and the GLVC's week four 
player-of-the-week Pieier Van 
Altena and guard Rafe Young. 

The Panthers are second in the 
conference in field-goal percentage, 
scoring and first in three-poini per- 
centage. However, ihey are seventh 
in scoring defense and rebounding 



margin. 

Forward Jason Burkhan said, "I 
think he's looking for some guys to 
step up so he can see what ihey do... 
hopefully, ihis weekend, we can 
have five guys step up and we can 
win those Iwo games," meaning the 
games against KWU and USI. 

The Lady Panthers enter wilh a 7- 



8 record. 2-5 in the conference. Last 
year, ihey placed ninth in the GLVC 
and gathered a 9-17 record overall, 
5-13 GLVC. 

New coach Michele Rupe returns 
four starters, including last year's 
conference newcomer, center Jill 
Buraess, who averages 17 3 points 
and over 10 rebounds per game. She 



has stepped up in conference play to 
21 points and 11.4 rebounds per 
game. 

KWU is in the bottom four in 
GLVC in scoring defense, scoring

Eagles. 

The USI men's squad will chal- 
lenge the Mastodons with a 13-2 
record, including nine straight, and 
a number 12 ranking. The 
Screaming Eagles were the NCAA 
Division II tournament runner-ups 
last year, and return some primary 
elements from last year's team 
which won the GLVC by three 
games 

Two-iime coach-of-lhc-ycar 
Bruce Pearl fields a talented five- 
some which includes junior all- 
conference performer Stan Gouard, 
a 6-foot, 5-inch forward. The 
Eagles also feature Indiana State 
University transfer Chad Gilbert, 
who replaces departed AII- 
Amcrican Chris Bowles. 

USI is in the top four of every 
offensive category in the GLVC. 
However, tbey are last in scoring 
defense in the conference and aver- 
age fewer than six three-pointers 
per game. 

The 'Dons are near the bottom 
of each offensive category, except 
free-throw percentage. However, 
they have climbed considerably 
since the GLVC season began. 

IPFW guard Jeff Jackson said, 
"We need to come out with a lot of 
confidence. We need to rebound." 
The Screaming Eagles arc first in 
rebound margin. 

Burkhan added, "I think these 
would two great wins to have this 
week; these are the two best teams 
in the conference; two of the best 
in the nation." 

Last year, the USI women's 
team won a school-record 12 con- 
ference games. This year, they arc 
without last year's GLVC player- 
of-tbe-year. Kathy Lauck. 
However, the number three-ranked 
Screaming Eagles now spon a 15- 
game undefeated record. 

The Eagles are at the top in the 
GLVC in scoring offense, margin 
and field-goal percentage. The 
Lady 'Dons are in the top half of 1 
all offensive categories in the con- 
ference except three-point percent- 
age. However, they rank in the bot- 
tom four in every defensive cate- 
gory. 

IPFW assistant coach Nikki 
Inzano said the Lady 'Dons must 
play defense to succeed this week 
at home. Guard Wendy Recker, 
who leads the conference in assists 
per game said the team also needs 
to maintain its intensity during the

The negative effects of 
cholesterol are explained 



V 



Just a decade 
ago, cholesterol was a 
word that few could pronounce or 
spell, much less have any regard 
for in their own lives. Today, that 
has all changed. When Vanna 
White spelled out CHOLES- 
TEROL on ":Whecl of Fortune," 
the category was "common house- 
hold term." 

What Is Cholesterol? 

Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like, 
odorless substance. We need cho- 
lesterol for a number of bodily 
functions: manufacture adrenal 
and sex hormones and Vitamin D, 
to produce bile acid used in diges- 
tion, to build cell walls and to 
form the protective sheath around 
nerves. In very young children, 
cholesterol plays an important role 
in brain development, so it is 
important to have some choles- 
terol circulating tbroughout the 
bloodstream at all times. 

Cholesterol is so important that 
the body makes its own supply in 
the liver. In fact, if we never ale an 
ounce of cholesterol, our bodies 
would make all wc need. 
Unfortunately, some of us make 
more than we really need and we 
compound the problem by eating a 
high-fat, high-cholesterol diet. 
Consequently, it is only when the 
amount of cholesterol in the blood 
becomes too high that health haz- 
ards begin to appear. 

Cholesterol, Lipoproteins, and 
t l-.i r i Disease 
High levels of serum (blood) 
cholesterol have been found to be 
a major risk factor for coronary 
heart disease (CHD) - the number 
one health problem in the United 
States. Cholesterol levels fall into 
three categories: desirable-less 
than 200 mg/dL (milligrams per 
deciliter), bordcrline-high-200-239 
mg/dL and high-greater than 240

mg/dL. 

Cholesterol, like all fats, 
docs not dissolve in water, hence 
it attaches to proteins called 
lipoproteins, which allow the cho- 
lesterol to dissolve in the blood. 
Cholesterol is attached lo several 
different lipoproteins for cairying 
purposes; however, the two that 
are the most important to remem- 
ber are low-density lipoproteins 
(LDL) and high-density lipopro- 
teins (HDL). 

LDL cholesterol is often 
referred to as "bad" cholesterol. In 
mosl individuals, about two-thirds 
of cholesterol is carried on LDL. 
LDL is responsible for carrying 
cholesterol into the cells and arter- 
ies. A desirable level of LDL is 
less than 130 mg/dL. 

HDL cholesterol is considered 
"good" cholesterol. It is believed 
lo carry cholesterol away from the 
arteries and to the liver for elimi- 
nation. A desirable level of HDL 
is greater than 35 mg/dL. 

Cholesterol levels alone do not 
contribute to heart disease. People 
with high levels of HDL in pro- 
portion to LDL are less likely to 
develop CHD than persons with 
low HDL. Needless to say, the 
higher you can get your HDL 
level, the more protection you 
have against heart disease. 

Excessive amounts of choles- 
terol in the blood infiltrate the 
arteries and cause the buildup of 
fatty deposits in the inner walls. 
The amount of cholesterol deposit- 
ed in the artery is influenced by 
the amount of cholesterol circulat- 
ing. With high levels of blood cho- 
lesierol, the amount of cholesterol 
entering the artery wall is greater 
than the rate of removal; choles- 
terol accumulates and the athero- 
sclerotic plaque is initiated and 
begins to grow, thus causing CHD.

Screening 

Recent 
estimates sug- 
gest 29 percent of all adults have 
blood cholesterol levels that are 
higher than the desirable range. 
Studies show only 40 percent of 
people between 20 and 34 years 
old report having been screened 
for cholesterol and probably less 
for the older population. The 
National Cholesterol Education 
Program (NCEP) recommends that 
all adults age 20 and over be 
screened for high blood choles- 
terol every 5 years. Follow-up and 
treatment guidelines are based 
upon specific values of choles- 
terol. 

Dietary Therapy and 
Physical Activity 

The general aim of dietary ther- 
apy is lo reduce elevated serum 
cholesterol while maintaining a 
nutritionally adequate eating pat- 
tern. One should progressively 
reduce intakes of saturated fats 
and cholesterol. Cholesterol is 
found only in animal tissues - 
muscle, fat and various organs. 
Saturated fats are oils from animal 
products and some plants (i.e. 
coconut and palm) that are solid 
rather than liquid. These fats raise 
blood cholesterol. The way in 
which food is cooked is very 
important. Instead of frying, try 
baking, broiling or steaming. 
Instead of buttering your vegeta- 
bles, try adding herbs, lemon, lime 
or orange juice. Instead of sour 
cream, try low-fat yogurt or cot- 
tage cheese. 

The NCEP guidelines recom- 
mend a daily cholesterol intake of 
less than 300 mg for the average 
person. It is recommended that in 
order to lower your serum choles- 
terol level, cholesterol intake 
should be 200 mg per day or less. 



Did 
you know 
that 1 egg yolk contains 
240 mg of cholesterol, I Big Mac 
contains 75 mg cholesierol and 9 
mg saturated fat, and a large fry 
contains mg cholesterol, howev- 
er it contains, 4 mg saturated fat. 

Obviously, the less cholesterol 
a food product has, the better. But 
even the words "no cholesterol" or 
"cholesterol free" on a label isno 
guarantee that the food is appro- 
priate for someone on a choles- 
terol-lowering diet. Cholesterol- 
free foods - even those of veg- 
etable origin - can still contain 
large amounts of saturated fats. 

Also, the appropriate use of 
physical activity is considered an 
essential element in the therapy for 
elevated serum cholesterol. 
Mounting evidence indicates that 
physical activity fosters favorable 
levels of serum cholesterol. One 
study shows that adults who walk 
for exercise two-and-a-half to four 
hours or more each week tend to 
have reduced levels of total cho- 
lesterol. But remember, regular 
activity is more important than 
intensity. 

So, follow the golden rules of 
cholesterol reduction; eat right, be 
wary of "no cholesterol" labels 
and exercise regularly.
