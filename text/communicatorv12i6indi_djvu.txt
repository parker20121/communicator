Weekend College beneficial 



Classes fill needs 



By LINDA HARTMAN 

Ample parking, more time to do 
assignments, more open classes and 
the ability to fit schooling around busy 
schedules are some of the advantages 
of Weekend College, say students 
enrolled in the Saturday and Sunday 
classes. 

According to Linda Balthaser, co- 
director of Weekend College, "It gives 
people who work full-time during the 
week an opportunity to take classes and 
still have their evenings free to spend 
with their families. Weekend College 
was started for this purpose." 

These advantages may be the 
reasons enrollment in Weekend College 
is up 48 percent from last year, the first 
year of the Weekend College program. 

Eighteen IPFW departments and 
programs are represented in Weekend 
College; 57 classes are offered with 56 
resident and associate faculty mem- 
bers teaching. The average size of the 

Transitional Studies help 



classes is 19, with the largest, 
Introduction to Business 

Administration, having 73 enrolled and 
the smallest, Music Appreciation, 
having five. Only three classes were 
closed due to the large number of 
students enrolled. 

Eased parking regulations were 
noted by many of the weekend students. 
It is much easier to park because the 
students do not have to park in A or B 
lots — they can park anywhere except 
for restricted areas, even in metered 
spaces without putting money in the 
meters. 

Another advantage for the 
weekenders Is that they can arrange 
their schedules to meet- family 
obligations while continuing their 
educations. 

"It allows me to work full time and 
leaves me time to be a mother," said 
Barbara Bolls. 

"It is the only time I can take the 



course. I enjoy Saturday classes. It 
gives me a chance to get away from my 
kids," said Jerrie Shoemaker. 

The weekenders also enjoy classes 
more and have more time to complete 
their work. 

"It allows me to take more classes 
and come less times. I am fresher on 
Saturday," saidGlenda Vabbitt. 

"The weekend classes give you more 
time to study and get assignments 
done," said Debbie Fedhik. 

"I am not rushed in my weekend 
class," said Jerrie Shoemaker. 

Some students feel that there are no 
differences between weekend and 
weekday classes. 

"There's not much difference," said 
Lillie Holl ie. 

Weekend College was publicized 
through newspapers, television and 
radio, and City Utilities sent fliers out 
with its bills one month, said Balthaser. 



Students hurdle obstacles 



By CHRIS PYLE 

Transitional Studies, a program 
geared to meet the needs of students 
with both high academic rating and 
academic difficulties, is offered at 
IPFW. 

The program can help students 
overcome obstacles that affect lear- 
ning. Those difficulties so often are 
detected during placement testing or in 
the results of the Scholastic Aptitude 
Test (SAT). Students who achieved low 
scores in the reading comprehension or 
mathematics tests are advised to enroll 
in the Transitional Studies program. 

In operation less than four years, the 
Transitional Studies program began 
Nov. 8, 1976 by offering only non-credit 
courses. Credit courses were added in 
January 1977. Today, the program has 
broadened and expanded into several 
branches. 

One new branch of Transitional 



Studies is Returning Adults Place 
(RAP). 

RAP was organized for adults who, 
after a leave of absence from schooling, 
are hesitant to return. They have 
anxieties, fears and questions of Where 
will I go? Will I fit in? Will I function 
well in class? 

RAP attempts to dispell these fears in 
monthly discussions of problems of 
common interest such as study and test 
taking techniques, anxiety and in- 
structor expectations. Returning adult 
students also receive monthly 
newsletters that focus on the problems 
they face. 

"It's a good time to meet others in the 
same situation, make friends and learn 
solutions to university-related 
problems," said Michael O'Hear, 
director of Transitional Studies. 

Credit programs in Transitional 
Studies emphasize fundamentals in 
English, reading and mathematics. 



Sections of English 130 stress sentence 
structure, paragraph development, and 
writing expertise. 

Those people who test into 
mathematics III must often take a 
refresher course. Here they will review 
and learn basic math skills. 

Non-credit programs in Transitional 
Studies are offered through the 
Developmental Skills Center.' The 
center offers tutoring and reading, 
improving vocabulary, math, study 
skills and writing courses. The center 
even offers a program in improving 
student's memories. 

Transitional Studies can be utilized 
by everybody, said O'Hear. "The 
program isn't geared just for the slow 
learner. Many people are weaker or 
deficient in certain areas, such as 
math. Others need to review or take a 
refresher course. That's why we're 
here." 



Senators gain seats 



By SUE SNODGRASS 

Edward A. Nicholson, vice- 
chancellor and dean of faculty, offered 
the Student Senate two seats on the Vice 
Chancellor's Coordinating Committee 
at the last Wednesday's Senate 
meeting. 

The committee will allow Nicholson 
and the Senate to work together in 
establishing academic policies and in 
the allocation and re-allocation of 
faculty and clerical services. The 
Senate would also assist in the con- 
firming or denying of any rumors on 
campus and help the administration 
solve the problems of the student body. 

Nicholson wants to establish several 
forums in which the students, faculty 
and administration can work together 
to reduce the amount of political 
preoccupation on trivial matters. 

The Senate also amended Resolution 
L a resolution that would donate $15 to 



WIPU-FM for their public service. 

Such a donation of student money is 
against Students' Government policy, 
Ann Momper, student body president, 
said. The resolution was altered to state 
that the Senate encourages students to 
listen to WIPU-FM until this breach of 
policy can be further investigated^ 

The Senate recognized two student 
organizations IPFW Students for Dan 
Coats and Young People in Broad- 
casting, thus entitling them to financial 
support through the Students' 
Government. 

The last open Senate seat was filled 
by William Allen; Ellen Engleman was 
appointed to the Traffic Appeals 
Board; and Ken Schank, Shawn 
Spade, Kathy Ertel, Ann Momper and 
Dwight Fish were all accepted as 
members of the Chancellor's Student 
Advisory Committee.

The Student Union Board of Gover- 
nors (SUBOG) also met last Wed- 
nesday. 

Preparations for the annual ski trip 
are being made by Craig Baumgartner. 
The tentative date for the trip is Jan. 31 
with Cannonsburg, Mich., the 
destination. Student costs have not been 
set. 

SUBOG's first speaker this semester 
will be Terry Hafner, handicap, who 
will discuss the problems facing 
disabled Americans. The scheduled 
time is noon, Oct. 6, in the Fireside 
Lounge of Walb Memorial Union, 

SOFA makes 
'Arts' special 

By TIMOTHY J. ROSS 

The IPFW Department of Fine Arts 
on West Berry offers a student more 
than classroom learning. One main 
difference is the organization SOFA 
(Students of Fine Arts). 

"Though there have been some 
changes in the organization's five years 
of existence because most students are 
only enrolled part-time, the program 
will survive," said Phil Willett, last 
year's president. 

The group, as a whole, schedules no 
regular meetings, but does sponsor 
many activities. SOFA sponsors art 
exhibitions, an annual student auction, 
an annual Halloween party and a 
potluck dinner that occurs once a 
month. 

The most forthcoming event is an art 
exhibit at Westland Mall. At the exhibit, 
students will demonstrate print making, 
weaving, met J I working and other 
artistic abilities. Many of the items will 
also be available for purchase. The 
tentative date of the show has been set 
for October 22 thru October 25. 

Anyone who is interested in helping 
or joining SOFA should contact the 
Department of Fine Arts.

Full Moon rises 



By DEBBIE CANTWELL 

Inside a renovated warehouse, 
east of the city, the eclectic sounds 
of the Full Moon band disappear into 
walls covered with blue shag car- 
peting. 

There are no loyal fans to Join in 
their singing or help carry equip- 
ment. Tonight they're alone. Only 
the sound technicians lend a sen- 
sitive ear as the band rehearses. 

But this Saturday at 2 p.m., old 
and new fans alike will have the 
chance to hear Full Moon's songs, in 
concert, on the infield of the Tah- 
cum-wah Complex softball diamond. 
Full Moon, which has presented 
benefit concerts for various 
organizations since its debut in 
December, will receive all proceeds 
from the Saturday performance. 

The musicians seem relaxed, but 
somewhat tired, which is un- 
derstandable considering they only 
left their "real Jobs" a few hours 
ago. A red stage light casts a warm 
_glow throughout the room, trans- 
forming the warehouse into a stage. 

Sheryl Bechtelheimer stands 
behind a microphone with one hand 
in her back jean pocket. She holds a 
cigarette in the other hand. Only her 
lips, pressed to the mike, move as 
she belts out a solo. 

Beside her, Madeleine Pabis cups 
her hand to her ear. She is singing 
harmony and swaying gently with 
the music. Along with vocals, she 
plays guitar and percussion. 

Next to Pabis, David Miller joins 
in on harmony. He plays electric 
guitar and adds the song's eerie 
wah-wah sound. 

If Miller and the band's drummer, 
Jerry, resemble one another, in any 
way, it's because they're brothers. 
David and Jerry both joined Full 
Moon after their own group — Sun- 
storm Sea bolt— broke up. 

Rose Lazoff, like Jerry behind his 
set of drums, sometimes gets 
camouflaged in the sea of in- 
struments and equipment. An In- 
tense musiieian, her bass is about as 
long as she is tall. Nevertheless, her 
small hands slide over It ef- 
fortlessly. She closes her eyes and 
nods her head to the beat. 

The song ends and the group takes 
a short break. 

Pabis mills about the electric 
equipment, stepping ever so 
carefully over wires. Bechtelheimer 
heads for the coffee pot. 

lynne ostergren, Full Moon'squiet 
keyboard and bass player, prac- 
tices on her electric piano. A multi- 
colored wig stand— adorned with 
sunglasses— rests on the edge of the 
instrument, keeping her company. 

Sound technician Donna Berwald 
and stage manager Jeremiah 
Seabolt remain in the small control 
booth,. Berwald joined the band after 
Full Moon's benefit performance for 
the Rape Crisis Center in December. 
Seabolt— a student at IPFW— does a 
little bit of everything. He's 
technician, gopher and occasional 
pinch -hitter percussionist. 

Pabis fills her coffee cup and sits 
down on one of the few mismatched 



chairs in a corner lounge area. 
Several members go back to their 
places and begin playing a soft 
melody. 

Bechtelheimer and Jane Palajac 
harmonize together. Palajac crosses 
her arms against her electric guitar 
and sings lead. 

"The voice is like an instrument," 
says Pabis, sipping her coffee. "Like 
an electric or acoustic guitar, you 
can switch voices to get a different 
sound." 

Full Moon has a distinctive sound, 
Members call it "eclectic," Sort of 
rock and roll, sort of jazz, folk, 
blues, sort of acoustic, but very 
much Full Moon. 

Palajac is singing "Half Price," a 
song she and her sister, Jill, wrote 
together. Jill, also a member of Full 
Moon, plays recorders and per- 
cussion and accompanies Jane on 
vocals. 



that audience. Eventually, they 
would like to play other cities, 

Right now, however, the band's 
main goal is to play the college 
circuit. Soon the group will travel to 
the Great Lukes showcase for the 
National Entertainment Campus 
Activities Association to be con- 
sidered for college campus 
bookings. 

Of course, Full Moon is shooting 
for (he big time music scene, 
perhaps even for international 
acclaim. But in the meantime, the 
group just hopes to sur- 
vive—financially, creatively and 
emotionally, 

It's easy to see how local groups 
which have a future In the music 
industry fold before they get the 
chance to go anywhere, says Jane 
Palajac. Working full-time jobs 
during the day and rehearsing at 



Full moon has a distinctive sound. They call ft

Full Moon. 



'Half Price" is about women 
who get paid less for doing the same 
jobs as men and how they're always 
the first to get fired. The musicians 
describe the song as "like a machine 
overloading and breaking down, a 
song with emotions." 

None of Full Moon's songs— nearly 
all of which the members compose 
and arrange— will contradict their 
non -sexist, non-oppressive beliefs. 

"We want to do music for 
everyone," says Pabis, "but we 
especially want to do music that 
women don't feel oppressed by. So 
many of the big (famous) bands now 
are so oppressive to women." 

That may be one reason why 
women in Fort Wayne seem to 
gravitate toward Full Moon's music. 
But the group would like to expand 



night, she says, can really sap a 
band's creative energy. 

Friendship among band members 
also can get sapped, she adds. 

Just to make sure that doesn't 
happen, Full Moon meets with a 
consultant-education specialist who 
teaches them to communicate ef- 
fectively with one another, to ex- 
press their needs as band members 
and friends. 

These "processing meetings" are 
as important, say the band mem- 
bers, as their three-hours-a-night, 
four-nights-a-week rehearsals. 

Tonight's one of those sessions. At 
10 p.m., the band members will 
leave their instruments behind and 
enter the cool night air. In the pitch 
black sky, above the warehouse, the 
harvest moon shines bright.

Change 
not for 
parking 



By BRAD LEMNA 

If students expected the grounds 
work on the south side of the campus to 
provide more parking, they ere going to 
be disappointed. 

Instead of extra parking. Richard F. 
Schaaf, director of buildings and 
grounds, described the work as 
cosmetic in nature. 

The back slope (the bank facing the 
U.S. 30 Bypass) was too steep to 
properly maintain, Schaaf said. The 
bank was a 2 to l grade, which means 
that for every two feet the bank moved 
forward, it moved one foot up. 

"This is a common ratio for a back 
slope," said one source at the Indiana 
State Highway Commission. 

Schaaf contended that the degree of 



the slope made it too difficult to mow 
the grass, and since the Highway 
Commission only cuts grass once a 
year, the responsibility of fixing the 
slope fell on the university. 

Plans for the project were initiated 
three years ago and a permit had to be 
obtained from the Highway Com- 
mission to do the work, since the bank is 
part of the bypass right-of-way. 

"As far as we were concerned, it (the 
degree of slope) was fine with us," a 
member of the maintenance depart- 
mental the Highway Commission said. 

With ground seeded and the work 
already completed, except for the 
lowering of the manhole covers, Schaaf 
estimated the cost at approximately 
$6,000.

Athletic program needs 
campus, community support 



IPFW is growing by leaps and bounds. 
Evidence of this is seen in (he various con- 
struction, remodeling and landscaping 
projects taking place on the campus. 

The university is proud of the campus 
growth. Evidence of this is shown in the 
"What we were; What we will be" display in 
the Helmke Library. 

The athletic program at IPFW Is growing 
too. But its growth may not be as fast, as 
easy, or as obvious as the university's 
physical growth. 

In the last issue of The Communicator, we 
reported that the only funding provided the 
athletic department by the university, Is used 
to pay the salaries of the department's 
athletic director and full-time secretary. 

It is understandable the university has 
priorities and only a limited amount o( money 
for which to fund various programs. At any 
educational facility, the education must come 
first. It is a top priority. 

But IPFW — as a commuter campus — is in 
a unique situation. To justify its existence, it 
must grow, and to grow, it must establish 
itself as an integral element of the com- 
munity. 



IPFW musl be image-oriented, as must any 
university. What better way to create a 
favorable image than through a successful, 
well-known sports program. And what better 
community like Fort Wayne, a sports con- 
scious community, to promote such a 
program. 

The community needs to identify with 
IPFW. Athletics offer an excellent common 
ground for the community and the university 
to relate to one another. 

The IPFW athletic program is growing 
because of the industrious efforts of a 
dedicated few persons. 

Eventually, the university will lend support 
to the athletic program. This may be financial 
or it may be only moral support and en- 
couragement. 

The important question is when? 

It would seem to be advantageous for the 
university to adopt the relatively young 
athletic program now — thereby allowing the 
two to grow together and reap the benefits of 
combined maturity — rather than to wait for 
Iheprogram to develop on its own, and then be 
offered partnership by the university, 



These 



rise 



high- 
parking lots 
are for 
the birds.

Fourth District race 'unique' 



By MARK PARKER 

Editor's note: Mark 
Parker Is a student at IPFW. 
He will he covering up- 
coming campus election 
events for The Com- 
municator. These are his 
thoughts about the Fourth 
District race between 
republican Dan Coats and 
democrat John Walda. 

Voters in the Fourth 
District are faced with a 
unique situation. 

In the race for Congress, 
the two major parties have 
both put forth candidates 
who are young, reasonably 
good-looking and ambitious. 
With these differences 
between Republican Dan 
Coats and Democrat John 
Walda at a minimum, the 
voters have an opportunity 
to decide who should 
represent them based upon 
the issues. 

In addition, this is only the 



second time this century an 
incumbant isn't running for 
the office. So, there is no past 
record, privilege of office, or 
question of experience to 
cloud or confuse the issues. 




Voters, however, can 
inform themselves before 
they step into the polls. They 
can do this by listening to the 
candidates' commercials, 
reading candidates' 
literature and paying at- 
tention to their speeches, not 
only for content, but also for 
the character they project. 

Know not only what the 
issues are, but how they 



affect you, your family and 
the city and county. 

The educational com- 
munity can serve as a 
special -interest group this 
election year. To do so, it 
must realize what issues are 
at stake and which candidate 
best represents its 
viewpoint. 

In an election unen- 
cumbered by decisive 
charismatic differences, this 
group has the opportunity to 
make a choice based on the 
issues. It also can make that 
choice an intelligent and 
informed one. 

Students at IPFW will be 
able to compare the fourth 
district candidates and their 
issues October 13 from 11:30 
a.m. to 12:30 p.m. in the 
Walb Memorial Ballroom, 
when Dan Coats and John 
Walda participate in a forum 
sponsored by Campus 
Ministry and The Com- 
municator.

"I like to be involved with campus

Essex, sophomore commercial arts

I can't imagine what it would be 
like. I'd say 'probably not' because 
we'd still be segregated. They look 
down on us. The location promotes an 
'out of sight, out of mind' thought. At 
least we don't have to worry about the 
campus or hunt for a parking place."

"There is a big difference between 
the art student and an academic 
student. This place is more open and 
relaxed. The students work in an old, 
historical, environment which 
promotes creativity." Roger

"I like it here better. It's a relaxed 
atmosphere and you have the 
freedom to be creative. But, the

ByJOHNULMER 

Dean of Student Services 

A recent Gallup poll 
revealed that among in- 
stitutions, higher education 
led the list relative to the 
degree of confidence people 
had in the institutions 
themselves. 

The comfort of this 
revelation; however, is 
shortlived when comparing 
the higher education con- 
fidence level in 1966, 61 
percent, with today's level, 
33 percent. 

Obviously, ranking 
number one with a 33 percent 
rating is indeed an in- 
dictment by the public of its 
overall trust level of major 
institutions in general. 

While public opinion 
serves as one indicator of 
education's importance, 
financial support really 
demonstrates the value 
placed upon education by the 
general public. Post- 
secondary education will be 
competing increasingly with 
a host of other governmental 
agencies for limited tax and 
foundation monies in the 
decade of the 80s. The need, 
therefore, to launch and 
mold positive public opinion 
on behalf of higher education 
has never been greater. 

Whether we realize it or 
not, each of us, be we 
alumni, students, faculty or 
staff, play an important role 
in molding D?FW's com- 
munity image. 

For example, unlike 
students on a residential 
campus, IPFW students 
interact daily with working 
colleagues, neighbors and 
family. Therefore, when one 
multiplies over 10,000 credit 
students, plus a like number 
of continuing education 
students, times their off- 
campus daily people in- 
teractions, the potential for 
their being TPFW's best 
front-line recruiters and 
public relations agents is 
quite evident. 

Likewise, each faculty and 



staff member lives in the 
community, has neighbors, 
contributes time and energy 
to numerous civic, social and 
service groups and thereby 
serves a vital role toward 
contributing a positive 
university Image to the 
co mmuni ty -a t -large . 

One need only visit other 
colleges or regional cam- 
puses to realize on a com- 
parative basis how much 
more IPFW has to offer 
relative to educational op- 
portunities, physical 
facilities and community 
quality of life. 

How many people know 
that IPFW is the sixth 
largest university in the 
State? Do our neighbors 
know that we have over 90 
degree offerings ranging 
from certificate programs to 
master's degrees or that we 
have over 12,000 IPFW 
alumni living, working and 
making major contributions 
within their communities? 
Do our many publics really 
realize the tremendous 
resource of faculty con- 
sulting talent they have at 
their disposal because of the 
university's presence in the 
community? 

In short, a positive self- 
image of our university (in 
political terms, just plain ole 
horn tooting), shared and 
conveyed by each member of 
the university community, 
becomes our best defense for 
gaining future widespread 
public and financial support 
to meet the challenging 80s. 

Winston Churchill's 
physician, forever con- 
cerned over the prime 
minister's drinking habits, 
once remarked that if all the 
Scotch Sir Winston had 
consumed were contained in 
a single location, "it would 
fill half a room," to which 
Winnie responded, "so much 
done, so much yet to do." 

I believe the story is 
analogous to IPFW's public 
image impact in the future — 
much done, much yet to do !

Kettler loses water 



By TIMOTHY J. ROSS 

"It was just one of those 

things," said Richard Schaaf 

concerning the water outage 

in Kettler Hall on Sept . 22. 

Sometime during the 
weekend proceeding that 
day, a water main burst near 
Kettler Hall, leaving the 
building waterless. 

There was no apparent 
reason for the breakage, but 



Schaaf said "it was possibly 
from uneven settling or the 
traffic flow over the pipe." 

Water was restored to the 
building by 10:15 a.m. that 
day. Schaaf attributed the 
quick repair to the 
availability of men and 
machines now working for or 
belonging to IPFW. 

This was the second such 
outage since December 1979. 



Vet's cash delayed

September.

those who are expecting

By JIM CHAPMAN 

Why do some fifth-grade 
students read at the second- 
grade level and why are 
some first-graders held 
back? 

There are chances that 
some grade school children 
may have some type of 
learning disability. 

A learning disability does 
not mean that a child is 
mentally handicapped but, 
according to Phyllis Agness, 
assistant professor of 
education, that he is not 
performing up to the level 
that his potential indicates 
he should. A learning 
disability is not always 
present in all of the child's 
studies, but just possibly one 
or two. - 

"The problem is more 
often reading, but not 
always," Agness said. 

There are several causes 
of learning disabilities, 
according to Agness. A 
theory exists that points out 



minute-minimal brain 
damage as one of the causes. 
However, the idea is only a 
theory, and for now, does not 
help the child shake off his 
problem. 

"The cause is irrelevant to 
us," Agness explained. "Our 
purpose is to help the bhild 
overcome his learning 
disability." 

IPFW offers four courses 
to graduate students that 
must be taken in order for 
them to be endorsed as 
special education teachers. 
These courses deal with the 
theories behind and the 
diagnosis of learning 
disabilities. They also teach 
students how to treat the 
significant discrepancy in 
how a child is performing as 
compared to how he should 
be performing. Internships, 
or student teaching, are also 
included in the four year 
course. 

The courses are offered to 
graduate students only.

Artlink shows taste 



By NICKSTANGER 

Artlink has again 
displayed its excellent taste 
in Ihe artistic world around 
us, both in Its current 
exhibit, "41 From 41", by 
Bill Whorrall, and in its 
presentation of guitarist Pat 
Webb at the gallery las 
Friday evening. 

A small crowd of less than 
thirty people chanced the 
relatively unknown 
musician's performance and 
ended up listening to a top- 
notch guitar artist at work 

Webb, whose versatile 
music consists mostly of folk 
with a dash of country and 
bluegrass, credited the low 
turnout of people to his few 
northern Indiana visits In the 
past. 

The concert stage was 
simple with a single white 
slool and no electronic ef- 
fects or amplifiers. But even 
with a basic setup like this, 
Webb was not hindered In the 
least. 

In fact, the concert 
revealed the truth in 
unaltered guitar sound, and 
demonstrated Webb's unique 
and masterful use of Ihe 
instrument. 

Webb, bom in Missouri 
and now in his late 40's, 
joked intermittently with the 
crowd between songs At one 
point, before his rendition 
of "Variation in C", he told 
the audience that his guitar 
could be made to sound like 
any number of instruments. 
And he was right. Strum- 
ming effects produced the 
equivalent tones and ryth- 



mic sounds of a banjo, 
harpsicord, mandolin and a 
variety of other string in- 
struments If Ihe people 
were impressed with 
anything Webb did that 
evening, this was it. 

His selection of songs in 
the hour long concert In- 
cluded ''Cannonball Rag." 
"Rocky Mountain Break- 
down," the Beatle's "Nor- 
wegian Wood," "Sittin' on 
Top of the World" and the 
theme song from "The 
Mickey Mouse Club." With a 
Tew exceptions, most ol the 
folk tunes echoed the usual 
theme of "I lost my girl and 
it took me a full 12seconds to 
geloverit." 

The variety played con- 
tained a few of his originals, 
such a "Wild Stallion", 
written for his "Latin" 
friends-and his own 
variations of folk tunes from 
down south, all recorded on 
his "Pat Webb Guitar" 
album. In all of his songs, 
however, the artist's per- 
sonal style is still quite 
apparent. 

The amazing appeal this 
foot-tapping, head-bobbing 
music has is hard to explain, 
especially to people who 
usually give folk and country 
music the same mental 
equivalency level Th« truth 
is that there is a lot of dif- 
ference between the two. 

Also at Artlink is the Bill 
Whorrall display, "41 From 
41". It is an excellent group 
of works by an artist who has 
a super eye for the ordinary 
extraordinary things. 



This type of art is what 
many people would describe 
as being on the borderline 
between art and junk. I feel 
Whorrall's work is quite 
unique, and at more than one 
piece, I stopped in my tracks 
to have a laugh at some of 
the more comical aspects of 
the works. 

The theme behind the 25 lo 
30 pieces, including some 
interesting works in 
acrylics, is based on the 
artist's apparent trip down 
Highway 41 through Indiana, 
Kentucky, Tennessee and 
Florida. Collages include 
postcards, photographs, 
cigarette wrappers, cut out 
cows and chickens, and 
all sorts of strange things 
incorporated into these 
creations crammed under 
glass, and all "suitable for 
farming." 

And of course, what trip 
through Kentucky would be 
complete without 'See Rock 
City' memorabalia? How 
about a painting of Indiana 
"flatscape' , Yes, they're all 
together in the two gallery 
Artlink show, which in my 
opinion deserves an "E" for 
excellent. 

This exhibit could only be 
possible through a creative 
mind being allowed lo 
wander aimlessly about, 
looking for an inspiration for 
a piece of collage that's "just 
right." It is this aspect that 
determines the interesting 
aesthetic quality in these 
works.

By HELEN BUSCHEY 

A concert in the park.. .it 
sounds too plain and simple. 
Yet there is no belter way to 
describe the Fort Wayne 
Philharmonic's flag-waving 
"Land of the Free Pops 
Concert," presented Sunday 
afternoon. 

The Foellinger Theatre in 
Franke Park was alive, not 
only with the sounds of 
music, but with the small of 
popcorn and the laughter of 
children and happy concert- 
goers enjoying the beautiful 
fall day. 

The concert, under the 
direction of Ronald 
Ondrejka, began promptly at 
2:30 with the National 
Anthem After two or- 
chestral selections, an 
impressionistic overture, 
"When Johnny comes 
Marching Home" and 
"Savannah River Holiday," 
the orchestra was joined by 
its baritone soloist Ron 
Rogers. 

Rogers, whose rich voice is 
familiar to Fort Wayne 
audiences and the Foellinger 
Theatre, and who referred to 
Fort Wayne as his second 
home, sang a medly of love 
songs, which included 
"Hooray for Love." "Love 



Walked In" and 'You'd Be So 
easy to Love." He closed Ihe 
first half of the concert with 
a dramatic, half-sung, half- 
spoken selection, "Molasses 
to Rum," from the show 
"1776." 

After the intermission, 
Rogers pleased the crowd 
with tunes from "On a Clear 
Day" and "Come Back to 
Me," his best of the af- 
ternoon and hit a more 
serious tone with "Glory 
Road," a song fantasy- 
narrative written by Jacques 
Wolfe Rogers thanked the 
audience for a standing 
ovation with the encore, 
"The Sound of Music." 

The audience had a little 
difficulty keeping the slow 
pace of the orchestra on 
several songs in the "sing- 
along" that followed, It was 
all in fun, informal mood 
that prevailed all afternoon. 

The orchestra closed the 
concert with a rousing 
"Stars and Stripes Suite" by 
Hershy Kay, a foot-tapping 
medley of familiar marches, 
resplendent with brass, 
cymbals and flute trills. 

The Philharmonic begins 
its regular 1980-81 season at 
the Embassy Theatre on Oct. 
11. 



Cars combine 
pop and punk 



ByGRETCHEN 
HOLOD1CK 

The Cars are a com- 
bination of electric pop and 
new wave punk. For the 
most part, they produce a 
mixture that is interesting, 
enjoyable, and at times, 
bizarre. 

With the release of 
"Panorma." their new 
album, the band has come 
out with the extreme of 
experimental psychadelia 
incomparable lo "The Cars" 
or even "Candy-O," their 
past two albums. 

Ric Ocasek formed the 
successful band in 1977, 
strongly influenced by bands 
like the Velvet Underground, 
created in 1966\ 

The band includes 
drummer David Robinson 
(ex-Modern Lovers), 
guitarist Elliot Easton, keys 
and sax man Greg Hawkes 
(ex-Martin Hull), and 
longtime musical partner 
bassist BenOrr. 

Singles by The Cars en- 
titled "My Besl Friend's 
Girl" and "Just What I 
Needed" were top quality, 
top40hitshereintheU.S. 

Although "Candy-O" was 
probably their best album 
thus far, "Panorama" has 
an intriguing effectiveness to 
it Kicking off "Panorama" 
is a song entitled the same, 
and although the song has its 
good moments, it's not in the 
same grade as the next 



track, "Touch And Go." 
Selling out with a pulsating 
beat, The Cars twist it 
around into a basically pop 
tune with a very catchy 
melody. 

One fault with The Cars' 
new album was they didn't 
produce too wide a variety of 
music within the context of 
"Panorama." Another 
minor fault coincides with 
the latter, being that, even 
though the songs last about 
four minutes, they tend to 
drag on without any contour 
or depth. 

The track I hat appears to 
stand out on the album is 
called "Down Boys." This is 
an excellent example of what 
The Cars can do at their best, 
which isn't conveyed too 
much in "Panorama." In 
"Down Boys" the listener is 
seized from the beginning 
and carried from chord to 
chord in what turns out to be 
aboul the most exciting thing 
about the album Surprising 
as it may seen, The Cars 
fabricated a song entitled 
"You Wear Those Eyes," a 
fairly quiet selection with a 
lot of feelings behind it; the 
lyrics are written well, and 
add a touch of variety to the 
album. 

For firm lovers of The 
Cars, "Panorama" should 
be considered. Also, for 
those infatuated with new 
wave or experimental pop 
this is a good choice.

At the movies 



Redford takes gamble 



By MIKECEFFEN 

Robert Redford recently 
stated in a Rolling Stone 
interview, "I'm interested in 
what's wrong in what ap- 
pears to be perfect." 

The theme of something 
wrong lurking behind the 
seemingly normal is a 
thread that runs through 
some of Redford's most 
outstanding work as an 
actor His films "Three Days 
of the Condor," "The Can- 
didate," "Downhill Racer" 
and "All The President's 
Hen" all deal with flaws in 
the so-called perfect 

Redford's fascination with 
this theme is apparent in his 
first film as a director, 
"Ordinary People." 

The film deals with an 
upper middle-class family 
living in the Lake Forest 
suburb of Chicago. The 
Jarrets seem to have 
everything going for them. 
However, they are merely 
existing with each other and 
each member is totally in- 
volved in his own world. The 
barriers crumble when, they 
have to deal with the son's 
mental breakdown. 

Redford tells this story 
with surprising subtlety. In 
fact, it is Redford's attention 
to tiny details that tells us 
the most about the 
characters. For example, 
the ritual they go through 
before dinner suggests that 
they are not comfortable 
with each other. These 
details also show that theie 
are deeper feelings being 
masked between them. 

The film presents an un- 
flattering, but honest view of 
family life. Redford doesn't 
try for simple answers. He 
doesn't tie everything up 
with a rosy ribbon like 
"Kramer vs. Kramer" did. 
Instead, he gives us flawed, 
somewhat shallow 

characters, that become 
real. It is a testimony to his 
seamless direclion and the 
actors' flawless per- 
formances that we care 
about thecharacters. 



Redford is a fine actor, and 
it is not surprising that he 
has gotten great per- 
formances out of the cast. 
What is surprising is their 
depth. Redford brings little 
nuances out of each actor to 
add to the totality of their 
characters. 

Donald Sutherland, as 
Calvin Jarret, the father, 
gives his best performance 
to date Sutherland finally 
has a role that shows how 
refined he can be in ex- 
pressing emotions. He 
makes us see that Calvin is a 
man who loves his son, but 
doesn't know how to express 
it. 

Mary Tyler Moore, as 
Beth, the mother, has the 
crucial role in the film. 
Beth's glacial character 
permeates every scene, and 
in many ways is the focal 
point of the film, Moore does 
a fantastic job of portraying 
the viciousness of Beth's 
character. She has the most 
demanding scenes in the film 
and pulls them off. I wouldn't 
be surprised if she i 
an Oscar nomination. 

Timothy Hutton, 



Conrad, the son, makes a 
strong debut. His portrayal 
of a boy tortured by his 
brother's death shows in- 
sight. Hutton has a unique 
quality that is a combination 
of all-American boy charm 
and James Dean roughness 
that makes us care and 
relate to Conrad. 

This marvelous cast, Alvin 
Sargent's tight script and 
John Bailey's lightly-hued 
cinematography blend 
together with Redford's 
controlled direction to make 
"Ordinary People" a nearly 
flawless study of a family in 
trouble. Redford has an 
awesome future as a director 
and shows the potential to be 
an even better filmmaker 
than he is an actor. 

"Ordinary People" is a 
classy film that doesn't sink 
into the soap opera cliches 
that recent family drams 
have. It is a film that cannot 
be easily forgotten. In this 
age in which most films 
deserve to be thrown into the 
trash heap, that is a 
tremendous feat. For this 
alone, Redford should be 
congratulated. His risky 
gamble will pay off. 



100 grants offered 



The Youthgrants program 
of the National Endowment 
for the Humanities will offer 
over 100 cash awards across 
the nation this fall to young 
people in their teens and 
early twenties to pursue non- 
credit, out -of -the -classroom 
projects in the humanities. 
The deadline for submission 
of completed applications is 
Nov. 15. 

The grants, which offer up 
to $2500 to individuals and up 
to $10,000 for groups ($15,000 
for certain high-cost media 
projects) are intended 
primarily for those between 
the ages of 15 and 25 who 
have a ways to go before 
completing academic or 
professional training. 



While the program cannot 
provide scholarship support 
or financial aid for degree- 
related work, it is the only 
federal program which 
awards money directly to 
young people for in- 
dependent work in the 
humanities. This includes 
such subject areas as 
history, ethnic studies, 
folklore, anthropology, 
linguistics, and the history of

Commodores thrill fans 



By SUE SNODGRASS 

Upon entering the concert 
arena, one sensed that 
something truly exciting was 
about to happen. That's just 
what last Saturday's 
Commodores concert at the 
Memorial Coliseum was, 
exciting. 

Before the Commodores, 
the S.O.S. Band brought the 
assembled fans to their feet, 
swaying to the driving beat 
of S.O.S.' new hit "Take 
Your Time." 

S.O.S. performed only 
three numbers, but 
thoroughly prepared the 
crowd for what was about to 
happen. 

The audience waited 
anxiously as the Com- 
modores prepared for their 
performance. 

Suddenly, a faint whisper 
of brass woke the wailing 
crowd, and the stage, a 
spectacular pompous 
display of lighted Hers, 
appeared. 

A green laser pierced the 
air and the sight of ten 
glittering musicians ap- 
peared. They were the 
Commodores. 

The blast of the horns and 
the pulsating throbs of Paul 
LaPrerad's percussion 
•formed a rhythmic melody, 
and the show opened with 



"Got to Be Together," 
selection from their new 
album, "Heroes." 

Ritchie's strong vocals 
were almost muffled, not 
because of poor acoustics, 
but because of the crowd's 
screams of excitement and 
approval. 

Next, the Commodores 
broke into "Brickhouse," 
their number one hit from 
1977. This funky tune had the 
devoted fans moving until all 
that could be heard was the 
tapping of toes and the ex- 
plosion of snapping fingers. 

A Commodores journey 
down memory lane led the 
audience to such tunes as "I 
Fell Sanctified," the Com- 
modores first Motown hit, 
and to more recent numbers 
that included "Just to be 
Close to You" and "Easy." 

As if this wasn't enough, a 
white baby grand piano, 
garnished in white lights, 
stealthily slid to the center 
stage. A hush befell the 
audience, and the horns, 
performing with a jazzy 
romanticism, accompanied 
Lionel Ritchie, on piano, to 
"Three Times a Lady" and 
"Still." This performance 
left the audience, in two 
words, in awe. 

Suddenly, the mood was up 
and moving again, as Walter 



Orange crooned "Let's 
Celebrate." 

Next, the guitars of 
William King and Thomas 
McClary whined as they 
broke into another funky 
tune, "All the Way Down," 
also from their new album. 

Although the song had 
good powerful horn, it was a 
disco trendy, and it relied too 
heavily on the gala of 
flashing lights, lasers and 
other props of stage shows. 

Although "All The Way 
Down" lacked Commodore 
freshness, the concert's 



finish proved that these 
musicians were indeed true 
performers. 

Again Lionel Ritchie led 
the vocals, but this time he 
was accompanied by a six 
member choir. "Jesus is 
Love," a gospel number, 
brought the captured crowd 
to their feet. As they asked 
the audience to reach their 
arms to the sky and to join 
the chorus in song, the 
Commodores proved that not 
only is their music pure soul, 
but that it is soul with a

By MICHELE DeVINNEY 

The St. Francis Theatrte 
Depl. . under the direction of 
Hal Gunderson, will be 
staging three productions 
between now and 

Thanksgiving. 

The first of those will be 
"Dirty Works at the 
Crossroads," a three-act 
play opening Oct. 17. 

"Crossroads" is an am- 
bitious undertaking for St. 
Francis. It's a melodrama 
from the 1890's, and although 
the lines will be performed 
seriously, the change of 
lifestyles and values in the 
past century will probably 
seem humorous to the 
audience. 

Gunderson welcomes this 
reaction, In fact, he en- 
courages it. He's hoping to 
loosen-up the audience with 
warm-ups before each 
performance so they will feel 
free to participate by 
cheering the heroes and 
heckling the villains. 

"Crossroads" also offers 
an interesting stage effect — 
a train running along a track 
and approaching ' the 
audience. Gunderson was 
wary of attempting the play 
because of that effect, but his 
daughter, who appeared in 
another production of 
"Crossroads," has helped 
draw plans for the staging of 
the scene. Gunderson is 
hopeful that it can be 
achieved. 

The ten character play is 
set on a farm where the 
villain, Munro Murgatroyd, 
is pursuing the heroine, 
Nellie Lovelace, in order to 
obtain her valuable land. 
The play also has a

The IPFW men's soccer 
team stretched its record to 
4-1 with wins over Concordia 
College and Adrian College 
of Michigan. 

IPFW defeated Concordia, 
5-1, In what Coach Ed 
Stefankiewicz called a "well 
played game. " 

IPFW attempted 40 shots, 
as compared to Concordia 
who oniy kicked 11. The 
entire tempo of the game 
was controlled by IPFW. 

Tom Johnson led the at- 
tack with two goals. Mark 
Lothamer, Mark Gabrek and 
James Henmueller also 



drew Concordia blood. 

Against Adrian, the 
Tucker offense pounded 
their opponents with 58 
shots, while their defense 
held Adrian to just eight. At 
the end of the first half, the 
socre was IPFW, five and 
Adrian nothing. At game's 
end, IPFW had completed a 
10-0 win over Adrian. 

"They were not nearly the 
team that we expected them 
to be," said Stefankiewicz. 

Again, Tom Johnson, 

along with Dave Husar, led 

the way with two goals 

apiece. 

The Tusker reserves 



played half of the game 
against Adrian. 

Coach Stefankiewicz 
praised both Al Anzuri and 
Mark Carteaux, a new ad- 
dition to the team, for 
playing excellent games. 

For fPFW men's soccer, 
the support is growing with 
every game and Coach 
Stefankiewicz encourages all 
students to come out and 
support the team. 

On Tuesday the Tuskers 
were to have played In- 
state at home. This af-

play Purdue-Calumet al 
Hammond. 

Next Tuesday at 4 p.m. the 
Tuskers will face cross-town 
rival St. Francis on the 
IPFW athletic field. The 
game promises excitement 
as St. Francis received

most recent NAIA top 20

gold jerseys on game days. 
The uniforms are new this

"The team is starting to

Spikers host city tournament 



By CHRIS PYLE 

The women's volleyball 
team ran into rough going 
last week, first dropping two 
of three matches in the city 
tournament, then falling in 
all four starts al the Ken- 
tucky Invitational 

The Tuskers hosted the 
city tournament, held at 
Concordia College, which 
included the other three Fort 
Wayne college teams, St. 



Francis, Indiana Tech, and 
Bible. 

The Spikers first met with 
the Bible College Falcons, 
defeating them in two 
games, 15-13ond 15-13. 

Tusker coach Peggy 
Volsin was pleased lhat the 
girls were determined to win 
the hard-Fought match. "We 
had to push ahead to win the 
match, "Voisin said. 

The second round found 
the Tuskers pitted against a 



Women basketballers meeting 



There will be an 
organizational meeting for 
the women's basketball 
team next Monday, Oct. 6 at 
noon in Room 139 of Neff 
Hall. 



Anyone interested in the 
program, but unable to at- 
tend the meeting, can con-

Bruening in the philosophy 
department. 



defensively oriented St. 
Francis squad. The hosts 
won the first game of the 
match, 15-13, then gradually 
ran out of gas and suc- 
cumbed lo the Cougars, 13-15 
and 6-15. 

In their final match of the 
tourney, the Tuskers fell in 
two games to Indiana Tech. 
After falling badly in the 
opener, 5-15, IPFW gained 
some momentum but 
dropped the second game In 
a squeaker, 14-16. 

Last weekend, the 
women's volleyball team 
traveled to the University of 
Louisville to compete in the 
Kentucky Invitational. 

IPFW, a NCAA division III 
team, lost all four of its 
matches to division 1 teams 

Volson felt her team was 



somewhat intimidated by the 
more experienced squads. 
"The girls were scared, 
unsure and nervous," she 
said. 

In their first match, the 
Tuskers faced "a fine team" 
in Wayne State, according to 
Voisin. The Tuskers were 
able to score only five points 
in the two games, losing by 4- 
15 and 1-15. 

After the initial contest, 
the women settled a bit, but 
were still unable to win a 
single game from the later 
teams. 

In order, the Tuskers fell 
lo Mt, St. Joseph, 13-15and4- 
15, then to Eastern Illinois by 
7-15, 9-15, and finally to 
Central Florida, 5-15, 8-15. 

Voison views the Kentucky 



NAIA membership postponed 



ByMIKEFRANKE 
The much anticipated 
change from NCAA Division 
III lo the NAIA for athletic 
competition at IPFW will 
have to wait until next year, 
said athletic director David 
Skellon 

"The process involved too 
much red tape to work 



through In too short o time 
span, "Skellon said. 

There was a proposal to 
allow the university's 
baseball and soccer teams to 
apply for NAIA standing 
this season. With the 
proposal, the athletic 
department would have run 



under a dual membership 
syslem. 

Skellon felt that it would be 
wise to make the transition 
as a whole, starting next fall, 
and the proposal was 
scrapped. 

Therefore, all varsity 
programs will be sanctioned 



under NCAA Division III 
rules until the 1981-82 season. 
The change to NAIA next 
year will encompass all of 
the fPFWathletic programs. 
It will enhance the 
possibilities for post-season 
tournaments, a major key to 
building the university 
sports program.

experience. "We played 
excellent teams," she said. 
"As a small team, the girls 
held their own. Hopefully, 
the early season problems 
will iron out and we will be 
able to play more con- 



sistently as the season 
progresses." 

This Saturday, the spikers 
will participate in the 
Valparaiso Invitatiional. On 
Tuesday, the Tuskers host
