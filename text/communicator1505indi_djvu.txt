opinion 



Problem continues 
thanks to senate 



nrORDERTbHELP 



Bureaucracy has struck again. 
Monday, in its first meeting of the year. 
Lhe Fort Wayne (faculty) Senate passed 
a resolution, proposed by Marc J. Lip- 
man, associate professor of 
mathematics, to build a gravel parking 
lot on the norlhease side of campus, near 
lhe Multi-Purpose Building, Instead of 
along the river on the southwest side of 
campus. 

Why? To save the beauty of campus? 
To make sure the University Policy 
Resources Committee is properly no- 
tified'' To make students walk farther 
from their cars to class? 

Whatever the reason, the Senate did 
the students a great disservice by 
passing lhe resolution to build the lot 
near lhe Multi-Purpose Building. 

John Carnaghi, vice-chancellor for 
financial affairs, said during the 
meeting the present lot near the Multi- 
purpose Building Is the lost lot filled and 
the one near the river is the first filled. 
He also said an addition to the lot near 
lhe river could be completed by the end 
ol September He wouldn't speculate 
how long II would take to complete a lot 
near the Multipurpose Building. 

A lot Is needed over there, especially If 
Interest In intercollegiate sports picks up 
on Ihls campus. However, students 
are parking In the gross. Over 200 cars 
were Illegally parked last Monday. Why 



does lhe senate insist on delaying the 
parking lot further? 

Another problem Carnaghi sees with 
adding a lot near the MulU-Purpose 
Building is the water table. He said 120 
spaces were added last fall to that lot. 
but construction was delayed about 
three weeks because of problems with 
the water table. He also said Purdue 
engineers don't see Ihal problem if the 
lot is built near the river. 

Tom Harris, student body president, 
said he has received several complaints 
from students coming to school directly 
from work, who can't find a place to 
park and are subsequently late for class. 
If the lot is built next to the river. 
students won't have as far to walk from 
their cars to the class, and may not be 
late as often. 

All logic suggests building the lot near 
the river. Yes, 1PFW is a beautiful 
campus and its beauty should not be 
destroyed. However, while the faculty is 
bickering over where the lot should be. 
students are parking illegally in dif- 
ferent areas around campus. Parking in 
the grass will further destroy the beauty 
of IPFW, especially if it rains con- 
tinuously Tor several days. 

The lime for action Is now. Chancellor 
Joseph Giusti should choose Carnaghi 's 
plan over the senate's and build lhe lot 
Immediately, not sometime in the
