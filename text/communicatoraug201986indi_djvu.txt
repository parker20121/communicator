Wallace takes over realm as IPFW chancellor 



By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 
Editor-in-Chief 

A major national search 
concluded earlier this year when 
Thomas P. Wallace was named 
chancellor of IPFW. 

Wallace, 51, took over the 
realm as chancellor July 1, 
replacing Joseph Giusti who had 
been chancellor since 1984. Giusti 
had taken a leave of absence in 
1984 and resigned last August. 
Since then, Edward Nicholsen 
served as acting chancellor. 

Wallace comes to IPFW with 
much experience in working with 



"urban institutions" as he likes 
to call universities located in an 
urban area, such as Fort Wayne. 
"I've spent the last 18 years in 
two urban institutions," said 
Wallace referring to his positions 
at Old Dominion University and 
the Rochester Institute of 
Technology. "I really have 
become quite interested over the 
years of the special mission of 
urban institutions." 

Wallace served as vice 
president for academic affairs at 
Old Dominion. Prior to that, he 
held other administrative 



positions at the school. At 
Rochester, he was associate dean 
of the college of science and head 
of the chemistry department. 

Although some may not con- 
sider a move to Fort Wayne 
challenging, Wallace disagrees. 
"I think it's a challenge of really 
being able to build something," 
Wallace said of his move to 
chancellor of IPFW. The 
university recently celebrated its 
20th anniversary in 1984. That 
youthfulness, as compared to the 
ages of the two parent in- 
stitutions — Purdue University

Building a future... 

The new $1 million Animal Care Facility, being built on campus between Kettler Hall and the 
Classroom &amp; Medical Building, is expected to be completed by mid-September. The psychological 
sciences, biological sciences, preventive dentistry and medical education departments will use the 
building for animal research. Animal surgical facilities and housing for the research animals will be 
located in the building (photo by GabeDelobbe). 



and Indiana University — is the 
challenge Wallace was referring 
to. Wallace said he sees his job as 
one in which he should 
"generally try to lead in the 
evolution of the institution to 
become a mature urban in- 
stitution." 

Wallace has already begun to 
work on that evolutionary 
process. He sees a need for more 
space on campus. He looks 
forward to seeing a fine arts 
building on campus by fall of 1990 
if the additional $2.25 million 
needed is approved by the 
general assembly in 1987. Last 
spring the legislature approved a 
partial funding of 2.25 million for 
the fine arts building needed on 
campus. Wallace, who also sees 
another need for a second 
laboratory-classroom building 
for the sciences, is not 
overlooking the possibilityof the 
construction of dorms on cam- 
pus. 

To accomplish all of this takes 
money, and Wallace is not ex- 
pecting any handouts. He has 
plans for an aggressive fund- 
raising program which he would 
like to see kicked off next fall. 
"We've got to get some of the 
money to do part of this our- 
selves," said Wallace. 

However, the newest leader to 
IPFW is not overlooking the most 
obvious needs of IPFW either. 
Wallace said he would like to see 
an increase in the number of 
masters degrees offered at IP- 
FW, comprehensive un- 



dergraduate programs, and an 
increase in the level of faculty 
scholarship. He said he would 
like to see marked improvement 
in the quality of the un- 
dergraduate experience at IPFW 
to the extent people could 
compare IPFW to a private 
school. He has confidence IPFW 
could give students the quality 
and attention they would receive 
at a private university. 

One essential ingredient to the 
accomplishment of those goals is 
present in the community— the 
support of the businesses. "I'm 
impressed with the business 
community," said Wallace. 
"They feel good about IPFW," he 
said, "and that is instrumental 
in terms of building a future." 

As a matter of fact, Wallace 
was pleasantly impressed with 
the community as a whole. Fort 
Wayne is friendly, said Wallace. 
' 'One of the things I'm enjoying is 
being away from the choas." 
Wallace and his family are 
moving to Fort Wayne from a 
fast growing area of southeastern 
Virginia. 

Wallace, and his wife Barbara 
have three sons and one 
daughter. Their twin sons, Mike 
and Mark, aged 24, just 
graduated with degrees in 
engineering from Virginia 
Technical University. Their 
other son, Andy, 17, will be a 
senior in high school. The newest 
member of the family is Sarah, 
six months old. 



Governing body plans a full year for students 



By LILLIAN R. LYON 
Managing Editor 

While most IPFW students 
were running on the beaches, the 
Students' Government was hard 
at work planning for the 1986-87 
school year. 

According to Joseph 
Motherwell, student body 
president, the senate has begun 
to work on many projects for 
this year, such as lobbying 
through Purdue University 
President Steven Beering for the 
new fine arts building, and the 
reinstatement of HPER classes. 
In addition, the senate has 
students working on the 
university committee to 
streamline the registration 
process. 

Motherwell, in his second year 
in office this term, would also like 
to have a voter registration drive 



"(SUBOG is) going to try to reach out to 
students more. " 

JOSEPH MOTHERWELL 
STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT 



this fall. He also noted the senate 
has begun plans for two major 
projects: one, a student life 
survey, which would be a stan- 
dardized survey of the opinion of 
students on IPFW professors, 
activities and classes, among 
other categories. "In general, it 
will give students feedback about 
life at IPFW," said Motherwell. 
A student-faculty-administration 
committee will formulate 
questions for the survey. 

The second major project is a 
course evaluation booklet made 
up of a survey of students and 



professors, containing in- 
formation like average class size 
and student rating of classes. 
"We're not sure yet if the cost 
involved will justify the project," 
Motherwell said. 

Another project the senate may 
be working on is searching for 
volunteer support from local 
attorneys for student legal aid. 
The federal budget for Legal Aid 
of Maumee Valley was cut, and 
there will no longer Oe attorneys 
on campus from this service. 
Students will be referred to their 
office in Fort Wayne for advice. 



Motherwell would like to see the 
senate locate attorneys in the 
Fort Wayne area who would 
volunteer their advice for IPFW 
students in need of assistance. 

SUBOG, too, has been busy. 
The board has elected to con- 
dense Harbor Arbor from a week 
to about two days. The name will 
also be changed, possibly to 
Homecoming, and it may take 
place either in fall or spring. 

SUBOG also has planned a 
Henry Lee Summer concert for 
Sept. 14 in the Walb Memorial 
Union amphitheatre. 

Promotional advertising will be 
radio broadcast and free albums 
will be given away. 

The SUBOG film series has 
been altered. Instead of many 
minor films, one or two major 
films will be shown a semester. 
Also, the Mid-day Diversions will 



continue to appear in Kettler 
basement, the cafeteria, or 
campus courtyards. 

The SUBOG governors are also 
"going to try to reach out to 
students more," said Mother- 
well, by making them aware of 
SUBOG's involvement in campus 
activities. 

Students Government has also 
completed student discounts. 
This year's list includes ap- 
proximately 50 vendors, and 
many other businesses have 
expressed interest. Motherwell 
said an additional list may be 
published in the spring to include 
these offers. 

Any student interested in 
joining Students' Government 
should stop by the office in Suite 
225 of the Walb Memorial Union 
Building.

Student body presidents hold brainstorming session 



By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 
Editor-in-Chief 

Student body presidents from 
Indiana's state-funded univer- 
sities recently joined forces to 
plan strategies concerning a 
student appointment on the 
Commission for Higher 
Education and a statewide 
student voter registration drive. 

Joe Motherwell, the IPFW 
student body president, was one 
of about a dozen representatives 
to participate in the two-day 
brainstorming session held in 
Indianapolis Aug. 2 and 3.

"We were really very 
pleased," said Pat Cross, the 
Indiana University-Bloomington 
student body president, of the 
event. He and an assistant of his, 
Robert Duehmig, planned the 
weekend for several purposes. 
"One of those," said Cross, "was 
just to give everyone an op- 
portunity to meet." Another 
purpose, he said, was to address 
several issues in higher 
education. 

The Commission for Higher 
Education was a very important 
discussion topic, said Mother- 
well, who's just launching his 
second term as president. 

The commission is responsible 
for making suggestions for 
changes and improvements in 
universities, as well as 
suggesting projected budgets for 
universities to the state 
legislature. 

One of the main priorities the 
student leaders set, he said, was 
to become more involved in the 
Student Resource Committee, a 
student advisory group for the 
commission. The purpose of that, 
said Motherwell, was to get a 
student member on the com- 
mission, "which in my opinion, is 



a really lofty goal." 

However, Motherwell said that 
such a goal is not unobtainable 
and has an important purpose. To 
get a student member on the 
commission would take 
legislative changes because the 
commission positions are 
governmental appointments. But 
such an achievement would pay 
off for students. 

"Although we can lobby on a 
year to year basis," said 
Motherwell, "to get a student on 
there (the commission) means 
we could look forward and catch 
things before they happen. " 

A related project the president 
singled out to work on is a 
statewide student voter 
registration drive which Cross 
sees as the first priority. "The 
main reason for that," said 
Cross, "is the average college 
age cohort — as voting goes — is 
the lowest of any cohort. Any 
power we have is our voting 
power." 

"If every campus could just get 
1000," said Motherwell, "that 
would add 6,000 to 8,000 voters on 
the list. They (the legislators) 
are going to pay attention when 
they see a huge block of student

Arts 'n Crafts Room has 
something for everyone 



By LILLIAN LYON 
Managing Editor 

Got a little time between 
classes? Need a break from the 
books? Tired of sitting through 
lecture after lecture? 

What you need is a visit to the 
Arts 'n Crafts Room. 

No, it isn't just for art students, 
and it isn't downtown. The Arts n' 
Crafts Room is for all students, 
faculty and staff at IPFW. It is 
located in the Walb Memorial 
Union, suites 214 and 218. And the 
facilities are free to use. 

Maralee Martin, director of the 
Arts 'n Crafts Room, stresses the 
availability of the room to all 
students on campus, whether for 
relaxation or for work on class 
projects. "A lot of engineering 
students use the room to work on 
their senior class projects," she 
commented. 

The Arts 'n Crafts Room is 
equipped for many different 
activities: a darkroom for black 
and white photography, weaving 



looms, lipidary and silk 
screening equipment, an electric 
kiln and potter's wheels, a 
drawing and painting area, and a 
woodworking shop with car- 
pentry equipment. 

But, like most good things, 
there is a catch— a small one. To 
use the facilities, students must 
purchase all consumable 
materials, such as pottery clay, 
photo paper and paints. There 
are lockers just outside in the 
hallway for storage of supplies, 
and materials can now be pur- 
chased in the Sweet Shoppe, on 
the ground floor of the Walb 
Memorial Union. 

Martin would like to stage 
demonstrations of various arts 
and crafts skills throughout 
the school year to interested 
students. She plans to post notice 
of the sessions on campus for 
students to attend and learn a 
special craftmaking talent. 

Hours for the Arts 'n Crafts 
room are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., 
Monday through Friday.

IPFW student awarded theatre fellowship 



By M. KATHLEEN GREVEN 
Features Editor 

"What good is a bachelor's 
degree in Radio-TV-Film 
anyway?" is a question on the 
lips of many IPFW Com- 
munications students right now. 

Donette Blanks, a recent 
graduate of the program, has 
parlayed her degree into a full 
fellowship and generous stipend 
from the University of West 
Virginia at Morgantown. 

She will study theatre (her 
minor at IPFW) for the next two 
years and complete one summer 
of repertory theatre, then be 
granted a master's degree in 
theatre. 



"Without the preparation I 
received working in PIT 
productions, I never could have 
gone to graduate school," she 
exclaimed. 

The theatre fellowship came 
about as a result of the Univer- 
sity Regional Theatre 
Association Auditions (URTA) 
Blanks attended last spring, her 
GPA and performance ability. 
The first session of auditions, 
held at 13 sites nationally, 
weeded 450 emerging actors out 
of 4000 hopefuls. 

"The average callbacks (by 
university recruiters) for women 
was two or three," she said. "I 
received five!" 



Of those five. Blanks chose 
Morgantown as her residence 
for the next couple of years. 

Blanks had not considered a 
career in theatre when she en- 
tered IPFW after high school. 
She'd had a little experience in 
speech and some exposure to 
high school productions, but no 
practice in "real theatre." 

While working on her degree in 
Radio-TV-Film, she became 
acquainted with Bob Bresnick, a 
visiting instructor at the time. He 
encouraged Blanks to audition 
for "House of Blue Leaves" in 
which she landed a small part. 



"Since then," she said, "I've 
been in seven PIT productions, 
two at the Civic Theatre and the 
Civic Guild show." 

Of PIT productions, Blanks 
speaks glowingly, citing the 
excellent learning experience 
this association has provided. 

"This is the one theatre in town 
that is teaching oriented — if you 
want to learn about the theatre in 
Fort Wayne, this is it! ! " 

Looking back upon her ex- 
perience with PIT, Blanks recalls 
"always enjoying working with 
the various directors and 
meeting a lot of people. " 



Blanks said most of her friends 
are from her participation with 
Students Government and PIT. 

Involvements at IPFW netted 
her a place on the honors lists, a 
leadership award (Students 
Government), an officer of the 
Theatre Club and Who's Who at 
American Colleges and 
Universities. She also earned two 
Anthony Award nominations for 
her work at the Civic Theatre. 

What are Blanks' plans after 
she graduates with her masters 
degree in theatre? 

"Well, then I am an official 
actor. I can starve with another 
degree!" 



Purdue-Indiana Theatre planning a diversified season for fall 



By M. KATHLEEN GREVEN 
Features Editor 

A tentative schedule has been 
announced for the fall semester. 

"The season opener is still 
being negotiated," said Larry L. 
Life, PIT director and theatre 



instructor. 

"She Stoops to Conquer," by 
Oliver Goldsmith will join "The 
Homecoming" by Harold Pinter, 
both to be directed by Joel K. 
Murray. 



Boothe, will be directed by Life. 

This past summer season has 
been the best one seen at PIT in 
its history, according to Life. 

"I'm ecstatic about the way the 
summer went," he said. "The 



"The Women," by Clare response was to the big name 



musicals we did last summer was 
fantastic!" 

Life feels that it's a different 
audience who attends the sum- 
mer offerings than during the fall 
or spring season. "Many people 
shy away, possibly, due to the 
more controversial nature of the 



plays presented during the year. 
IPs good to get those people in the 
theatre." 

Now that Life has proven many 
people in Fort Wayne are at- 
tracted to big name musicals, he 
hopes to bring them to PIT next 
summer, too. 



Festival promoted world peace 



By LILLIAN R. LYON 

Managing Editor 
Last week, IPFW co-sponsored 
the Second Annual Festival of 
Peace and Understanding with 
the Associated Church of Fort 
Wayne and Allen County. Many 
events were held around Fort 
Wayne during the Festival, 
which took place Aug. 9-17. 

The Festival, formerly a 
three-day event, featured forums 
on domestic violence, world 
hunger, South Africa and Central 
America, in addition to the 5K 
Run for Peace, the Al Stiles 
Talent Show, and the children's 
art and film festival. 

The five forums on world issues 
were held around Fort Wayne 
during the nine-day festival. Two 
featured South Africa and 



presented films on apartheid and 
the history of Black African 
resistance. The world hunger and 
the Central America forums 
were held at the public library 
and showcased speakers. The 
forum on domestic violence 
featured open discussion on non- 
violence. 

Free workshops on Parenting 
for Peace and Justice were also 
held, in addition to adult films on 
peace issues. 

Special performances in 
Friemann Square were given and 
displays of the Peace Quilt and 
Peace Ribbons were shown at the 
YWCA Villa on Wells St. 

Author, economist and peace 
activist Dr. Kenneth Boulding 
from Denver, Colo., lectured at 



the IPFW Classroom Medical 
Building on Friday, Aug. 15, and 
held a working lunch on Satur- 
day, Aug. 16. 

The Festival ended Sunday, 
Aug. 17, at Foellinger Theatre 
with an all-city multi-choir 
celebration.

Coach Kast 'searching for school spirit' 



By GINA M.JONES 
Copy Editor 

The IPFW Cross Country team 
has a new coach, and a new 
outlook this year. Mike Kast was 
named as the new coach for the 
1986 season. 

"I'm really happy with the 3 
men that have turned out so far, 
but I do need to see some school 
spirit," said Kast. "The op- 
portunity is there for someone to 
earn a varsity college letter. All 
they need to do is come see me. " 



Coach Kast is looking for five 
women and three to five more 
men. The meets are once a week 
on Saturdays. The women run a 
5K, or 3.1 miles, and the men run 
usually 5 miles, or a 10K, which is 
only 6.2 miles. Coach Kast states, 
"I'm not looking for 
marathoners, I just need people 
who like to jog, run for fun, and 
would like to show school spirit." 

The practices are held Mon- 
days, Wednesdays and Satur- 
days. On Mondays the team 



practices at 5:30, and they meet 
at the Franke Park Pavilion. On 
Wednesdays the team meets at 
4:30 p.m. at the Multi Purpose 
Building, and on Saturdays at the 
Multi Purpose Building at 8 a.m. 

"I know this is a commuter 
college, and that people work, but 
I really think we have more 
school spirit here. It is a great 
opportunity to earn a varsity 
letter," Coach Kast said. "I am 
very pleased with the three men 
that have shown up and started 



running so far. I have a good 
feeling about the upcoming 
year." 

Anyone interested in joining 
the Cross Country team, or 
talking to Coach Kast about 
joining the team has only to call 



the Athletic Center at 481-6643, 
and ask for Coach Kast. Or you 
can call 423-1430 (daytime), or 
426-5140 (evenings). 

The season opens on Sept. 6 
with the IPFW Hokum-Karem. It 
starts at 9 a.m. 



Van Houten named new softball coach 



IPFW Athletic Director Dave 
Skelton has named Dale Van 
Houten as the coach for the 
women's softball team. 

Van Houten coached the 
Columbia City High School girls' 
softball team this past spring and 
has been involved with softball 
since 1958. He has coached 
several area men's and women's 



softball teams during that time 
and has made a name for himself 
as a player, as well as a coach. 

The Columbia City native will 
be one of four men inducted into 
the International Softball 
Congress (ISC) during the 1986 
World Tournament in Sioux City, 
Iowa in August. Van Houten will 



become one of only 28 members 
so honored. The Indiana Com- 
missioner for ISC' for the past 26 
years, he was a national 
president of the organization 
from 1972-75. He was an active 
player or coach for every ISC 
tournament from 1958 through 
1979.

chancellor stresses quality of education 




Wallace 



I want to thank The Com- 
municator for this opportunity to 
welcome you to academic year 
1986-87 at IPFW. As you may 
know, this will be my first year at 
the campus. I am anxious to 
learn more about you and to work 
with you and your faculty to 
ensure that rPFW provides the 
educational experience you need 
for meaningful careers and lives. 

To accomplish this goal, I 
intend to initiate this fall a Task 
Force on the Nature and Quality 
of the Undergraduate 
Experience at IPFW. This is an 
excellent institution that has 
within its reach the potential to 
become a distinctive and truly 
outstanding urban university. 
The purpose of the Task Force 



will be to define the elements of a 
high quality undergraduate 
experience such as small class 
size, doctorally-prepared faculty 
for freshmen, undergraduate 
research, exciting genera] 
education programs, modern 
curriculum, emphasis on 
academic skills, cooperative 
education opportunities, in- 
ternships, honors programs, and 
good academic and career 
counseling. We will likely 
discover that IPFW already has 
in place many of the elements 
normally associated with a 
successful private college; 
others will need to be developed. 

From initial conversations 
with students, alumni, and 
faculty I have learned that one 



element many of you hope will be 
strengthened is the quality of 
student life. Though this is a 
commuter campus, improved 
out-of-classroom activities seem 
to be of great interest. Students' 
Government President Joe 
Motherwell and I have made a 
start by discussing expanded 
hours for the recreational 
facilities in the Multipurpose 
Building and ways space in the 
Walb Memorial Union can be 
used more effectively. He and 
other students will work with me 
and other University officers to 
continue these discussions and 
make recommendations to the 
Task Force. Please let your in- 
dividual thoughts on this matter 
be known to your student 



representatives. 

Something you can do now to 
improve student life and benefit 
personally is to become involved 
in campus activities. Your 
initiative, talents, and creativity 
will be welcomed by IPFW's 
diverse student organizations. 
Whether you seek a recreational 
outlet, cultural stimulation, 
academic enrichment, or just 
plain fun, there should be an 
organization to meet your needs. 
If not, why not make a proposal 
to Students' Government or to 
this administration to begin the 
organization or activity you find 
lacking. I am eager to work with 
you and look forward to a busy 
and rewarding year. 



Take advantage of these services at IPFW 



Grades can be appealed 

The academic appeals process applies to all students 
enrolled at IPFW. It can be used by any student who has 
evidence or believes that evidence exists to show that a 
course grade was assigned or a similar evaluation was made 
as a result of prejudice, caprice, or other improper condition 
such as mechanical error. 

In appealing, the student must support in writing the 
allegation that an improper decision has been made and 
must specify the remedy sought. The student should seek the 
assistance of the Dean of Student Services in pursuing the 
appeal. During an appeal, the burden of proof is on the 
student, except in the case of alleged academic dishonesty, 
where the instructor must support the allegation. 

Grades may be changed only by a university authority 
upon the decision of the Academic Appeals Subcommittee, 
or by the instructor any time prior to the decision of the 
Academic Appeals Subcommittee. 
Timing of Appeals 

An appeal must be initiated no later than the fourth week 
of the fall or spring semester immediately following the 
session in which the decision was made. Each successive 
step in the appeals procedure must be initiated within three 
calendar weeks of the completion of the prior step. 
Steps in the Process of an Academic Appeal 

1. Course instructor: The student makes an appointment 
with the instructor to discuss the matter. ( If the instructor is 
unavailable, the department-division-program chair shall 
authorize an extension of time or allow the student to 
proceed to Step 2.) 

2. Department-division-program: If the matter has not 
been resolved at Step 1, the student makes an appointment 
with the chair of the department-division-program offering 
the course, who will direct the student procedurally in 
making an appeal to the appropriate committee. 

3. Academic Appeals Subcommittee : If the matter has not 
been resolved in Step 2, the student makes an appointment 
with the Dean of the Faculty, who will direct the student 
procedurally in submitting the case to the Academic Appeals 
Subcommittee. 
Department-Division-Program Appeals Procedure 

Each department-division-program will establish appeals 
procedures which provide for a committee of three or more 
Faculty members responsible for hearing academic appeals 
related to courses listed or administered by that depart- 
ment-division-program if those appeals hav. ..Jt been 
satisfactorily resolved between the student and the in- 
structor. The procedures established by each department- 
division-program shall provide for each case to be heard by 
only one such committee, and a copy of each unit's 
procedures will be given to the Deans of Student Services 
and of the Faculty, and to students upon request. 
Academic Appeals Subcommittee 

This subcommittee shall consist of seven members and 



tional Faculty according to procedures specified in the Techniques II), a study-skills course which emphasizes the 



Senate Bylaws 

No member of the subcommittee may take part in an 
appeal involving a course or instructor from the member's 
department-division-program. Alternates will be assigned 
by the chair to serve as regular members in such cases. 

Before hearing the details of a case, the subcommittee will 
decide whether to consider the appeal, and will report its 
decision in writing to the student and the instructor. The 
bases for a decision to consider an appeal may include (but 
not be limited to) a finding that (1) improper procedures 
have been followed by university employees at earlier steps 
of the appeal;' (2) new information is present; or (3) the 
instructor has declined to accept the department-division- 
program committee's recommendation. 

If the case is heard, every member of the subcommittee 
will vote on whether the appeal is valid and, if so, on what 
remedy should be provided. If the subcommittee, by 
majority vote, finds in favor of changing a grade, the chair 
shall report this finding to the Registrar. The decision of the 
subcommittee is binding on all parties and may not be ap- 
pealed. 

The subcommittee shall report its findings and actions to 
the student, the Dean of the Faculty, the department- 
division-program from which the appeal came, and the 
instructor. 

Tutors are available 

On the way to a degree, you may need some help. 
Transitional studies can make the critical difference. 

The RAP (Returning Adult Place) program is for 
students coming to the university after being out of school 
for one or more years. RAP features a free monthly 
newsletter on university services and procedures, and 
meetings dedicated to improving students' study or per- 
sonal skills. To get the newsletter and meeting in- 
formation, stop in Kettler 118, or call us at 481-6817. 

The Learning Center (Kettler 118) offers you free help in 
developing reading, writing, math, and study skills (note- 
taking, textbook-reading, test-taking) on a drop-in basis, day 
and evening, during the school year. 

You can find in The Learning Center free tutorial 
help in some introductory courses. We also attempt 

The Developmental Skills Center (Kettler 118) offers you 
free help in developing reading, writing, math, and study 
skills (note-taking, textbook-reading, test-taking) on a 
drop-in basis, day and evening, during the school year. 

You can find in the Developmental Skills Center free 
tutorial help in some introductory courses. We also attempt 
to match people needing tutorial help in advanced courses 
with available tutors; financial arrangements for this 
tutoring must be made by students and tutors involved.

application of study skills to real college courses; and 
selected sections of Math HI, which maintain a smaller than 
average student-teacher ratio. 

Financing is available 

Financial aid helps students finance their college 
education. The financial aid office (481-6820) uses grants and 
scholarships, loans, and part-time employment, either singly 
or in combination, as the means to provide this assistance. 

Even though most aid is restricted to full-time un- 
dergraduate students, some programs are available for part- 
time and graduate students. You must file an IPFW financial 
aid application and a Financial Aid Form (FAF) to be con- 
sidered. The applications are reviewed confidentially by a 
financial aid counselor, and your aid award is based on the 
calculated need and the availability of funds. 

You are urged to apply by March 1 for the following 
academic year. Applications are accepted after that date, 
but late filers run the risk of encountering fund shortages. 
Also, early application assures that your forms will be 
processed in time for fall registration. 

The financial aid office, located in Kettler 109, has a staff of 
trained counselors to assist with the application process. The 
regular office hours are 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through 
Thursday, and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday. If necessary, ap- 
pointments may be made for other times. 



GI benefits can be used 

Your GI Bill education benefits can be used at IPFW. The 
veterans' services office in Kettler 107 will help you apply 
for aid. Usually, the only form you should bring is your 
discharge paper (DD214) . 

Normal processing time for a new application is 45-60 
days. 

The Vet-Rep-On-Campus has information dealing with all 
phases of veterans' benefits, or can refer you to the proper 
community agencies. 



Housing assistance offered 

No housing facilities are on the IPFW campus. However, 
the student activities office (481-6830) dispenses housing 
information upon request. There are dormitory facilities 
available for men and women at nearby Concordia 
Theological Seminary, and dormitory-type facilities 
available for women only at the YWCA. The student ac- 
tivities office does not approve or disapprove housing; it 
merely serves as a clearinghouse for housing information. 



Student 

ID cards 

open doors 



Each student is issued a picture identification card 
containing his-her name and Social Security number. The 
student must provide accurate data for inclusion on the 
card, and must show the card to an employee of the 
university upon request. Prior to showing the card, the 
student, if he or she asks, is entitled to be toldthe reason for 
the request and the employee's name and position, and be 
shown the employee's university identification card. 

The student identification card or card validation is given 
to each student at registration. The replacement fee for lost 
ID cards must be paid at the bursar's office. Replacement 
cards are issued from the dean of student services' office, 
SU 118, upon showing a paid receipt. 
Here are some reasons why you need an ID :

Campus organizations serve students 



There are over 50 recognized student organizations at 
IPFW. If a group is interested in an activity that is not 
organized, it is possible to start a new club. The necessary 
steps are as follows: 

1. Obtain from the Office of Student Services a petition 
which is to be signed by the faculty advisor and officers of 
the organization. 

2. Present the petition and two copies of the constitution to 
the director of activities. 

3. The constitution committee of the Student Senate will 
review the constitution and forward it to the Senate with a 
recommendation. 

4. The Senate will vote on recognition. 

5. Upon approval, the officers of the recognized 
organization must establish a checking account in the 
bursar's office. All funds must be deposited in this account.

University policies, procedures outlined 



NOTE: The questions and answers shown below are 
intended to help explain some of the most important 
university policies. The campus bulletin includes official 
information about these policies. 

ATTENDING CLASSES 

1. Is regular class attendance required? 

Yes. Although the method of recording attendance may 
vary from class to class, students are expected to attend 
every class meeting for which they are enrolled. 

2. What should I do if I am unable to attend a class? 
Contact the professor as soon as possible to make 

arrangements for make-up work, if such work is permitted. 
The only acceptable excuses for absence are generally 
related to illness and family emergency situations. Missing 
classes may seriously reduce the quality of your work and 
result in a poor grade. 

SCHEDULE ADJUSTMENT 

3. Can I drop classes any time I want to? 

No. A class cannot be dropped during the last six weeks 
of the semester or the last two weeks of a summer session. 

4. How do I drop a class? 

First you must get a drop-add form from your advisor. 
During the first 9 weeks of classes, that is all you must 
submit to the registrar's office to officially drop the class. 
After that time, the instructor and your academic dean 
must also approve each class to be dropped, and they will 
do so only in unusual circumstances. 

5. Can I add a class to my schedule after I have 
registered? 

Yes. Classes may be added with approval from your ad- 
visor during the first week of classes. The instructor of each 
class must also approve additions after that time. 

6. If I want to quit school before classes are over, what do 
I have to do? 

Follow the procedure described for dropping a class. Not 
attending class is not the same as withdrawal. Students who 
do not withdraw properly from a course will receive a 
failing grade. 

CHANGING MAJORS 

7. Can I change my major if I change my mind about what 
I want to study? 

Yes. You should contact the department that offers your 
new major. If you are accepted as a student in your in- 
tended major, your new department will notify the 
Registrar's office. 

GRADES 

8. What kind of grades are given credit courses? 
A full list of grades appears in the IPFW Bulletin. 

9. What is the "Pass-Fail Option" for a grade in class? 
This is an opportunity for you to take some courses 

without affecting your GPA. However, unsatisfactory work 
may count as an F in your GPA. You must have an ad- 
visor's permission to take a course under this option. 

10. What does it mean if I get a grade of "I", incomplete? 
The grade of "I" means that you could not complete all 

requirements for the course by the end of the semester and 
that you and the instructor have agreed on a method to 
finish those requirements. You must remember that if the 
requirements are not met by the appropriate deadline, that 
incomplete "I" grade will become an "F" failing grade. 

11. If my grades are bad, will I be able to continue in 
school? 

First, all grades that you have earned at this campus will 
be averaged together. Generally, the first semester that 
this average is below the university's or school's minimum 
requirement you will only be placed on probation, which 
means that you will be given an opportunity to raise your 
GPA through additional classes the next time you enroll. If 
yuu then continue with poor grades.you will be subject to. 
dismissal from the university. 



12. If I am dismissed from the university, will I ever be 
permitted to return? 

Generally a student may request readmission to the 
university after being out of school for one semester. Once 
the readmission is approved, the student will be able to 
enroll but will again be placed on probation until the 
minimum GPA has been achieved. The request for read- 
mission must generally be submitted one month before the 
start of that semester. 

OTHER ACADEMIC 
MATTERS 

13. Under what conditions ami considered to be a student 
in good standing? 

You are considered to be in good standing if not 
dismissed, suspended, dropped from the university without 
being readmitted, or on probation. 

14. What conditions will deny me the opportunity to 
register for classes? 

The most common reason is that you owe money to the 
university. If you are a student in good standing, other 
reasons would include misconduct and violation of any 
rules adopted and made public by the trustees. 

15. If I feel that I have not been treated fairly with regard 
to a grade I received or an assignment I completed, what 
can I do about it? 

You have the right to request that the situation be 
reviewed in a process called a grade appeal. For in- 
formation regarding such procedures, contact the chair of 
the department responsible for teaching the course. 

16. Can I transfer from the Fort Wayne campus to another 
school? 

Yes. However, any student who intends to transfer should 
consult with her or his advisor to make proper 
arrangements well in advance of the intended time of 
transfer. 

17. What is plagiarism? 
Plagiarism is claiming the work of someone else as if it 

were your own original work. Plagiarism usually occurs 
when a student writes a paper, submits a project, or 
prepares a collection and includes quotes or ideas from 
another source without acknowledgement. It is serious 
violation and can lead to disciplinary action. 
NONDISCRIMINATION 
IPFW is an equal access-equal opportunity university. No 
qualified person will be denied admission or employment, 
nor will any student or employee be subjected to 
discriminatory treatment or be excluded from par- 
ticipation in any educational program or activity, on the 
basis of race, religion, color, sex, age, national origin, 
handicap, or status as a disabled or Vietnam Era veteran. 

Support available for disabled 

Individuals who have a disability or suspect a disability 
and wish to take advantage of the opportunities and support 
services available to them should contact 481-6657 or come to 
the office of Disabled Student Services in the Multipurpose 
Bldg., Room 204. 

Disabled Student Services provides counseling and 
guidance , orienta t ion to the campus, readers for the visually 
impaired or learning disabled, textbooks on tape, note- 
takers, and interpreters for the hearing impaired, outdoor 
escort service in inclement weather for persons in 
wheelchairs, exam proctoring, and many other services.

Bldg, Room 207. 

All buildings and most classrooms on campus are ac- 
cessible. Petailed maps .and literature are available upon

action officer (482-5434) .

National Student Exchange 
offers world travel study 

An exciting opportunity awaits students through the 
National Student Exchange program. Have you ever 
dreamed of going to school in Montana, New Mexico, South 
Carolina, Wisconsin, or perhaps even Hawaii, and not be 
charged out-of-state fees? Your dream could come true by 
participating in the National Student Exchange. 

The NSE provides the opportunity for IPFW students to 
spend a year of study in residence at a member institution 
during their sophomore or junior years. Participating 
students remain enrolled at IPFW while on exchange, and 
credit earned on exchange is recorded as regular degree 
credit. It is an ideal way for students to broaden cultural 
and educational horizons while progressing toward their 
local degree objectives. 

If the National Student Exchange sounds exciting and 
interesting to you, stop by Kettler HOE and ask for more 
details'.'-' ' •' .-.•■.-

Uncertain about your major? 
We can help!!! 

Assisting students with academic schedules as well as with 
other academic problems is the role of the student academic 
counceling office. Staffed with professional counselors and 
student paraprofessionals, the office is open from 8 a.m.-5 
p.m. weekdays, and after 5 p.m. by appointment. You may 
stop by the office in Kettler HOE or call 481-6814 for

confidential.

undecided students, pre-business students, pre-health 
students and pre-nursing students attending Indiana- 
Purdue. So if you are still uncertain about your major or 
have questions regarding the university, the student 
academic counseling staff can help. 



University assures confidentiality of student records 



Release of Student Information 

A. In compliance with the 
Family Educational Rights and 
Privacy Act, the IPFW policy 
governing access to student 
records is described below, 
beginning with the following 
definitions: 

1. Student is defined as one who 
has attended or is attending 
IPFW. 

2. Educational records include 
those records maintained by the 
institution but exclude records 
maintained by individuals and 
available only to those in- 
dividuals or designated sub- 
stitutes (i.e. "personal files"). 

3. Public information is limited 
to name, address, phone, class 
standing, school-division, major 
field of study, dates of at- 
tendance, current enrollment 
status, degrees and awards, 
recognized student activities, 
sports, and athletics information. 
Records of arrests and-or con- 
victions are public records and 
thus not subject to institutional 
policy. 

4. Record includes any data or 
information about the student 
and related individuals regard- 
less of media used to create or 
maintain the record. 

B. Public information will be 
released in response to any 



request unless the student has 
filed a restrainer form according 
to procedures specified by the 
Registrar. The only public in- 
formation items whose release 
may be restrained are address 
and telephone number. 

C. All students have 
educational records located in 
one or more of the following 
offices and maintained by the 
administrator of that office: 
Admissions, Alumni, Athletics, 
Bursar, Continuing Education, 
Counseling-Testing-Placement, 
Financial Aid, Honors Program, 
Police and Safety, Registrar, 
Student Affairs Administration, 
Transitional Studies, and 
academic units. 

D. The confidentiality of all 
records may be broken in an 
emergency situation if deemed 
necessary in terms of the 
severity of the emergency, the 
usefulness of the records, and the 
extent to which time is critical in 
responding to the emergency. 

E. A student's record is 
available to that student, with the 
following exceptions : 

1. Confidential letters of 
recommendation submitted prior 
to 1975. 

2. Records of parents' financial 
status. 

3. Records described in Sec- 



tions F, G, and H, below. 

F. Records related to the 
employment of a student are 
subject to other laws and ad- 
ministered by the Personnel- 
Payroll Office. 

G. Medical and psychological 
records will be released only to a 
physician or other health-care 
professional designated by the 
student. 

H. Letters of recommendation 
for which the student signed a 
voluntary waiver of access will 
not later be disclosed to the 
student. Waivers must be 
voluntarily signed by the student 
and may only be related to 
recommendations concerning 
admission, candidacy for 
awards, and candidacy for 
employment. These recom- 
mendations may be used only for 
the purpose originally intended. 

I. Except as noted above, 
student records are available to 
members of the faculty and staff 
who have a legitimate need for 
access to the record, with the 
legitimacy of the request 
determined by the administrator 
of the office responsible for 
maintenance of the record. 

J. The following procedures 
apply to all offices maintaining 
records: 

1. The student may see the 



record after completing a written 
request, either in person or by 
mail. 

2. Access to the record must be 
allowed within 30 days and the 
student must be allowed to copy 
the record, subject only to 
payment of any applicable 
copying charges. 

3. The student must receive an 
interpretation of the record, upon 
request, at or after the time that 
access is granted. 

4. If the student objects to any 
part of the record, and the 
responsible office will not revise 
the record as requested, the 
student must be given an op- 
portunity to request a formal 
hearing concerning the objection. 
Policies and procedures 
governing the hearing process 
will be specified by the Vice 
Chancellor for Academic Affairs. 

K. Records about a student will 
be released without the consent 
of the student in the following 
circumstances: 

1. To the student's parents if 
the student is a dependent as 
defined by the Internal Revenue 
Service. 

2. To federal officers as 
prescribed by law. 

3. As required by state law. 

4. To agencies or individuals 
conducting educational research. 



provided that the administrator 
of the records is satisfied con- 
cerning the legitimacy of the 
research effort and the con- 
fidentiality to be maintained by 
the researcher. 

5. To agencies responsible for 
accreditation of the institution or 
its programs. 

6. In response to a lawful 
subpoena, subject to making 
reasonable attempts to provide 
prior notification and opportunity 
for objection by the student. 

7. To institutional security 
officers when necessary for a 
criminal investigation. 

L. Records about a student will 
otherwise be released only upon 
completion of a consent form 
signed by the student. Any such 
release must include a notice that 
further release by the recipient is 
prohibited by law, and a record of 
the release must be maintained. 

M. The institution reserves the 
right to maintain only those 
records it considers useful and to 
set retention schedules for 
various categories of those 
records. However, the ad- 
ministrator responsible for each 
category of records must ensure 
that a record being challenged is 
not destroyed prior to resolution 
of the dispute concerning its 

i contents ..... c

maintain its facilities available for performance of its 
educational activities, or (2) which are in violation of the 
reasonable rules and standards of the university designed 
to protect the academic community from unlawful conduct, 
or (3) which present a serious threat to person or property 
of the academic community. Such phrase shall include, 
without limitation of the foregoing general definition, the 
unlawful use of force or violence on or within any buildings 
or grounds owned, used, occupied or controlled by the 
university; using or occupying any such buildings or 
grounds in violation of lawful rules or regulations of the 
university, or for the purpose or with the effect of denying 
or interfering with the lawful use thereof by others; and 
injuring or harming any person or damaging or destroying 
the property of the university or the property of others, 
within such buildings and grounds. 

Educationally sound sanctions may be proposed in 
combination with other disciplinary actions. 

"Disciplinary probation" means a probationary student 
status imposed for a limited time as a result of an official 
determination of misconduct. In the event the student is 
found guilty (under the procedures set forth in these 
regulations) of subsequent charges of misconduct com- 
mitted during the period of disciplinary probation, records 
of such disciplinary probations shall be taken into con- 
sideration in determining the disciplinary penalty, if any, to 
be imposed or the administrative action, if any, to be taken 
because of such subsequent misconduct. 

"Probated suspension" means conditional continuation 



of student status for a limited and defined period of time. 
The student is permitted to retain student status upon the 
condition that the student does not further violate any 
subsection of Section B-2 that would normally result in a 
disciplinary penalty during the time probated suspension is 
in effect. If, during the period of probated suspension, the 
student is found guilty of an additional violation of Section 
B-2 after a hearing, suspension may become immediately 
effective and may be extended for a longer period of time 
than the period of probated suspension originally assigned. 

"Suspension" means termination of student status for a 
limited time, generally without grades; however, in cases 
such as academic dishonesty, a directed grade for a par- 
ticular course may be appropriate. 

"Expulsion" means permanent termination of student 
status, generally without grades; however, in cases such as 
academic dishonesty, a directed grade for a particular 
course may be appropriate. 

B. Student Conduct 

1. General. Students are expected and required to abide 
by the laws of the State of Indiana and of the United States 
and the rules and regulations of Purdue University, to 
conduct themselves in accordance with accepted standards 
of social behavior, to respect the rights of others, and to 
refrain from any conduct which tends to obstruct the work 
of the university or to be injurious to the welfare of the 
university. A student who violates these general standards 
of conduct may be subject to administrative actions (as 
defined in Section A-5). If the violation falls within one of 
the categories of misconduct listed in Section B-2, the 
student may also be subject to disciplinary penalties (as 
defined in Section A-5). No disciplinary penalty may be 
imposed except for misconduct covered by one of the 
categories listed in Section B-2. 

2. Misconduct Subject to Disciplinary Penalties. The 
following actions constitute misconduct for which students 
may be subject to administrative action or disciplinary 
penalties, a. Dishonesty in connection with any University 
activity. Cheating, plagiarism, or knowingly furnishing 
false information to the university are examples of 
dishonesty. 

The commitment of the acts of cheating, lying, stealing, 
and deceit in any of their diverse forms (such as the use of 
ghost-written papers, the use of substitutes for taking 
examinations, the use of illegal cribs, plagiarism, and 
copying during examinations) is dishonest and must not be 
tolerated. Moreover, knowingly to aid and abet, directly or 
indirectly, other parties in committing dishonest acts is in 
itself dishonest. 

b. Forgery, alteration, or the unauthorized use of 
university documents, records or identification. 

c. Obstruction of disruption of any university activity (as 
defined in Section A-5) or inciting, aiding, or encouraging 
other persons to engage in such conduct. If substantial 
obstruction or disruption is threatened or occurs, the 
president, or a designee, may issue a disciplinary 
suspension warning. The minimum disciplinary penalty for 
violation of this subsection during the period of such war- 
ning shall be suspension for the remainder of the semester 
( or summer session) during which the offense occurred and 
for the next full academic semester and any intervening 
summer session thereafter. However, a more severe 
disciplinary penalty may be imposed. 

d. Physical abuse of any person or conduct which 
threatens or endangers the health or safety of any other 

person, whether or not such conduct occurs on university 
property. 

e. Theft, attempted theft, or damage of or to property of 
the university or of a member of the university community 
or campus visitor. 

f. Unauthroized entry, or use, or occupancy of university 
facilities. 

g. Violation of any university rule governing student 
organizations, or the use of university property (including 
the time, place, and manner of meetings or demonstrations 
on university property), or of any other university rule 
which is reasonably related to the orderly operation of the 
university; provided, however, that no disciplinary penalty 
shall be imposed in any such case unless it is shown that the 
accused student knew, or, in the exercise of reasonable 
care, should have known, of the rule in question. 

h. Use, possession, or distribution of narcotics or 
dangerous drugs, except as expressly permitted by law. 

i. Lewd, indecent, or obscene conduct or expression on 
university property. 

j. Failure to comply with directions of university officials 
acting in the performance of their duties. 

k. Any conduct which substantially threatens or in- 
terferes with the maintenance of appropriate order and 
discipline in the operation of the university, or any conduct 
on university property or in connection with a university 
activity which invades the rights of others. 



3. Demonstrations. Any individual or group activity or 
conduct, apparently intended to call attention to the par- 
ticipants' point of view on some issues, is not of itself 
misconduct. Demonstrations which dp not involve conduct 
beyond the scope of constitutionally-protected rights of free 
speech and assembly are, of course, permissible. However, 
conduct which is otherwise improper can not be justified 
merely because it occurs in the context of a demonstration. 
Demonstrations which involve violations of any subsection 
of Section B-2, will not be permitted. A student will be 
charged with misconduct for any individual misconduct 
committed by the student in the course of a demonstration. 

4. Status During Suspension or Expulsion. No diploma 
shall be given and no grades other than directed grades, 
academic credit, or degree shall be awarded any student 
who has been expelled or suspended from the University so 
long as the expulsion or suspension is in effect. 

5. Status During Disciplinary Proceedings. Except where 
summary action is taken as provided in Section C-7, the 
status of a student charged with misconduct shall not be 
affected pending the final disposition of charges, provided, 
however, that no diploma shall be given and no grades, 
academic credit, or degree shall be awarded to a student 
against whom charges are pending for which a disciplinary 
penalty may be imposed. The effective date of any 
disciplinary penalty shall be a date established by the final 
adjudicating body (the dean's office of the campus appeals 
board) . In case of suspension or expulsion, the student shall 
not be withdrawn any earlier than the date the notice of 
charges originated or later than the effective date 
established by the final adjudicating body. 







6. Misconduct Subject to Other Penalties. As provided in 
Chapter 273 of the 1969 Acts of the Indiana General 
Assembly, misconduct which constitutes a violation of 
these rules and regulations may be punished after deter- 
mination of guilt by the procedures herein provided without 
regard to whether such misconduct also constitutes an 
offense under the criminal laws of any state or of the United 
States of whether such conduct might result in civil liability 
of the violator to other persons. 

C. Procedures in Student Misconduct Cases 

1. Disciplinary and Administrative Action Proceedings, 
General. 

a. The procedures hereby established shall be followed in 
all cases in which the university institutes disciplinary 
proceedings or administrative action proceedings against 
students for violations of the rules of student conduct set 
forth in Section B. These procedures shall not apply to or 
affect the jurisdiction or procedures established by student 
organizations, student governments in University residence 
halls, University residences, or student judicial boards now 
or hereafter organized under the auspices of the Purdue 
Student Association, University residences, Interfraternity 
Council, Association for Women Students, or similar 
organizations. 

b. Disciplinary proceedings are those proceedings 
initiated by the issuance of a notice of charges and are 
governed by the provisions of Section C-l to 7 inclusive. The 
term "disciplinary proceedings" does not include ad- 
ministrative action proceedings. 

c. Administrative action proceedings are informal in- 
vestigations conducted by the dean's office with a view to 
possible^administra tive action. A dnunjstratiyeaction may 
be taken by the dean's office without instituting disciplinary 
proceedings, and such action shall be final and not subject 
to further hearing or appeal. A disciplinary penalty may not 
be imposed without first instituting disciplinary 
proceedings pursuant to Section C-2. If the dean's office 
confers with the student in the course of administrative 
action proceedings, no statement made by the student 
during such conference shall be used against the student in 
any disciplinary proceedings which may thereafter be 
instituted. 

2. Institution of Disciplinary Proceedings. 

a. Disciplinary proceedings shall be instituted by the 



Cont. on page 7 



AUGUST 20, 1986 - THE STUDENTS' HANDBOOK - PAGE 7 



Purdue Rights continued from page 6 

dean's office by the issuance of notice of charges. 

b. The notice of charges (and all other written notices 
given to students against whom disciplinary proceedings 
are initiated) shall be delivered by the most effective 
method to the student's address as it then appears on the 
official records of the university. The notice shall inform 
the student of the rule or regulation allegedly violated, also 
fairly inform the student of the reported circumstances of 
the alleged violation, and request the student to appear in 
the dean's office for a hearing on the incident. A copy of 
these regulations shall accompany each notice of charges. 
A copy of the notice of charges may be sent to the parent or 
guardian of the student if the student is dependent as 
defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. 

3. Failure to Respond to Charges. If the notice of charges 
requests the student to appear in the dean's office and the 
student fails or refuses to appear, the dean's office may, 
after such investigation as it may deem necessary, 
dismiss the charges, take administrative action, or im- 
pose a disciplinary penalty. If the dean's office takes ad- 
ministrative action, it shall notify the student in writing of 
such action, and such action shall not be subject to further 
hearing or appeal. If the dean's office imposes a 
disciplinary penalty, it shall notify the student in writing of 
such action, and the student may appeal such action to the 
campus appeals board as provided in Section C-6. When it 
appears necessary to avoid undue hardship or to avoid 
injustice, the dean's office may extend the time to enable a 
student to respond to the charges. 

4. Response to Charges. 

a. If the student appears in response to the notice of 
charges for the purpose of a hearing of the alleged violation 
as provided in Section C-5, the dean's office shall advise the 
student as fully as possible of the facts concerning the 
alleged charges and the names and addresses of witnesses 
then known to the dean's office. The student shall also be 
advised that no response is required, that any statement 
made by the student may be used against the student, that if 
the student remains silent, that silence will not be taken as 
an admission against the student, and that the student may 
advise the dean's office of any witnesses or evidence sup- 
porting the student's position. The dean's office shall also 
advise the student that if any new information is discovered 
during an investigation subsequent to the hearing, the 
student will have an opportunity to respond to such in- 
formation. 

b. After the hearing with the student and such further 
investigation as the dean's office deems necessary, the 
dean's office shall proceed as follows: 

1. If the dean's office determines that the violation 
alleged is not supported by the evidence, the charges shall 
be dismissed and the student notified. 

2. If the dean's office is satisfied that the violation oc- 
curred as alleged, but that no disciplinary penalty shall be 
imposed, the dean's office may take administrative action 
and notify the student. Such action by the dean's office shall 
be final and not subject to further hearing or appeal. 

3. If the dean's office is satisfied that the violation oc- 
curred as alleged and that a disciplinary penalty should be 
imposed, the dean's office shall so notify the student. 

5. Conduct of Hearing. Each hearing shall be conducted 
before one or more members of the dean of students office 
staff and, although the hearing is informal in nature, it shall 
provide the student certain procedural safeguards. 

The student shall be given the opportunity to hear the 
evidence against him-her, rebut statements made by 
witnesses, present witnesses, evidence, or any relevant 
information in the student's own behalf. The student shall 
also be given the opportunity to respond to any new in- 
formation gathered during an investigation subsequent to 
the hearing. The dean of student's office has the burden of 
proving the student guilty of the alleged violation, and the 
lecision of the dean's office shall be based solely on in- 
formation introduced at the hearing and obtained during 
subsequent investigations. 

No person other than the student shall be present during 
the discussion between the dean's office and the student 
except by mutual agreement of the dean's office and the 
student. 

Within five days following the conclusion of the hearing 
and subsequent investigation, the dean's office shall notify 
the student, in writing, of what action it will take. The 
decision letter shall contain a finding as to the guilt or in- 
nocence of the student and a brief statement of the reasons 
for the decision. Any disciplinary penalty imposed or ad- 
ministrative action taken is subject to the provisions of 
Section B-4 of this regulation and any other university rule, 
regulation, or directive then existing. 

6. Appeal of the Dean's Office Decision. The student may 
appeal the decision of the dean's office to the campus ap- 
peals board. An appeal may be initiated by filing a notice of 
appeal with the campus appeals board through the dean's 
office or with the chair of the campus appeals board. Such 
an appeal must be filed within seven days of the date on 
the letter from the dean's office containing the decision, and 
the appeal must be personally signed by the student. The 
dean's office will provide the campus appeals board with a 



copy of the notice of charges and the decision letter sent to 
the student. The university will be represented at the ap- 
peal hearing by the dean's office or other appointed 
representative. 

7. Summary Action. Summary disciplinary action by way 
of temporary suspension and exclusion from university 
property may be taken against a student charged with 
misconduct without the issuance of a notice of charges and 
without the procedures prescribed in Section C on the 
following conditions: Summary action shall be taken only 
by the president of the university or by an authorized vice 
president of the university, and only after the student shall 
have been given an opportunity to be heard if^such 
procedure is practical and feasible under the cir- 
cumstances. Summary action shall be taken only if the 
president or vice president is satisfied that the continued 
presence of the student on university property threatens 
harm to the student or to any others. Whenever summary 
action is taken under this Section C-7, the procedures 
provided for in Section C for hearing and appeal shall be 
expedited so far as possible in order to shorten the period of 
summary action. 

D. The Campus Appeals Board 

1. Organization and Jurisdiction. 

A campus Appeals board shall be established for each 
campus of the University. The Campus Appeals Board for 
the West Lafayette Campus shall consist of nine members 
selected in the following manner: Three undergraduate 
students and one graduate student shall be recommended 
by the Student Senate to the University Senate Nominating 
Committee. The University Senate will nominate three 
faculty members for appointment by the president. Two 
administrative staff members shall be appointed by the 
president of Purdue University, one of which shall be 
designated as chairperson of the Campus Appeals Board. 
An equal number of alternates of each class shall be ap- 
pointed at the same time and in the same manner as the 
regular members. From such panels of alternates the 
chairperson of the Campus Appeals Board shall designate 
the particular members as may be necessary. In ex- 
tenuating circumstances, additional alternates may be 
selected, as stated above, to ease the burden of an 
unusually large number of appeals. 

b. The term of office for student members and their 
alternates shall be one year, starting June 1, and con- 
tinuing through May 31, of the following year. The term of 
office of the faculty and administrative members shall be 
for two years beginning on June 1, and ending on May 31, 
two years later. No member shall serve more than two 
consecutive terms. If any appointing authority fails to 
make the initial appointments to the Campus Appeals 
Board within the time specified, or to fill any vacancy on 
the panel of alternates within five days after being notified 
to do so by the president of the University, or if at any time 
the Campus Appeals Board cannot function because of the 
refusal of any member or members to serve, the president 
of the University may make appointments, fill vacancies, 
or take such other action as he deems necessary to con- 
stitute a Campus Appeals Board for each campus of the 
University. 

c. The Campus Appeals Board shall elect a vice chair- 
person and secretary. It shall adopt regulations governing 
its procedures net inconsistent with these regulations. It 
shall have only the jurisdiction herein granted. 

2. Conduct of Appeal 

a. The campus appeals board may prescribe regulations 
governing the conduct of the appeals not inconsistent with 
these regulations. The appeal hearing shall be open to the 
public or closed as the campus appeals board shall deter- 
mine. If a hearing is to be open to the public, the campus 
appeals board may change the place of hearing, and its 
determination of the place and of the number of advisors 
and observers that can be conveniently accommodated 
shall be final. Notice of a change of place shall be given 
promptly to the student. An official tape recording shall be 
made of the appeal which shall be kept by the campus 
appeals board for at least one year. 

The student is entitled to be present at the appeal and to 
be accompanied by advisors of the student's choice. The 
student may also be represented by legal counsel, provided 
he-she files a statement of such intention, giving the name 
and address of such counsel to the chair or secretary of the 
campus appeals board at least 48 hours before the time of 
the hearing. If the university intends to be represented at 
such hearing by legal counsel, the accused student shall be 
notified of that in writi ng at le ast 72 hours before the time of 
the hearing. If the s tudent h as given such notice and is 
entitled to be represented by legal counsel, the university 
may also be represented by legal counsel regardless of any 
previously expressed intention to the contrary. The student 
shall have the right to confront and cross-examine wit- 
nesses and to present witnesses and evidence in the 
student's behalf. At the hearing, the burden of proving the 
student guilty of the alleged violation shall be on the 
university. The campus appeals board shall consider any 
evidence relevant to the incident. 

b. The campu&amp;appeals board shall decide the appeal and 
issue its written decision within ten days after the date of 



the appeal hearing, except where the president of the 
university authorizes additional time Copies of its decision 
shall be furnished to the student, the president's office, and 
the dean's office. 

If the decision being appealed found the student guilty 
and imposed a disciplinary penalty, the campus appeals 
board shall have the power either: 

— To reverse the finding and acquit the student 

— To affirm the finding and the disciplinary penalty 
proposed by the dean's office. 

— To affirm the finding and in cases where a proposed 
disciplinary penalty is believed inappropriate to the 
misconduct, to reduce or increase the severity of the 
disciplinary penalty or to direct that appropriate ad- 
ministrative action be taken by the dean's office in lieu of 
any disciplinary penalty. 

3. Appeals from the Dean's Office. The campus appeals 
board shall hear each case appealed from the dean's office 
and the procedures to initiate such appeals shall be as 
provided in Section C-6. 

3.4 Actions 

(a) A penalty affecting a student's grade in a course may 
be imposed by the faculty member in whose course the 
offense occurred. The faculty member is responsible for 
making proper notification to the department chair con- 

4. Appeals Concerning Recognition of Student 
Organizations. The campus appeals board shall have 
jurisdiction to hear and shall be required to hear any appeal 
taken by a student organization which the dean's office has 
refused to recognize or from which recognition has been 
withdrawn. In such cases, the campus appeals board shall 
either affirm or reverse the decision, and its action shall be 
"inal. 

5. Appeals from Student Supreme Court. The campus 
appeals board shall have discretionary jurisdiction to hear 
appeals from the student supreme court. In such cases, it 
may affirm or reverse a decision, and its action shall be 
final. 

6. Complaints under Bill of Student Rights. The Campus 
appeals Board shall hear complaints from students con- 
cerning actions or decisions made by the University which 
are claimed to violate rights established under the Bill of 
Student Rights. In such cases, the Campus Appeals Board 
shall have the power and duty to make findings and 
recommendations to the president of the University.

PAGE 8 — THE STUDENTS' HANDBOOK — AUGUST 20, 1986 



President welcomes all IPFW students 




JOSEPH MOTHERWELL 



A warm welcome to all new 
and returning students of IPFW. 

Because education is only a 
part of your total campus ex- 
perience, I encourage all 
students to become involved in 
campus activities. Once you have 
had the opportunity to settle into 
your classes and size up your 
personal schedules, consider 
your citizenship of this university 
— IPFW. There are over 50 
student organizations, an ex- 
cellent theatre department and a 
growing athletic program. Take 
advantage of the opportunities 
which surround you at IPFW. 

Students' Government is the 
official voice of the student body. 
There are two branches of 
Students' Government: the 



Student Senate and the Student 
Union Board of Governors 
(SUBOG). The Student Senate is 
the legislative branch of 
Students' Government which 
handles student concerns, 
university policy changes, 
student lobbying and the student 
activity fee allocation. SUBOG is 
the programming arm of the 
Students' Government which 
plans film series, co-sponsors 
events, concerts, dances, parties, 
vacation trips and guest 
speakers. Please consider joining 
either group. Both are operating 
on approximately half-staff 
levels and are in need of your 
active support. 

Students' Government 
operates on an annual budget 
provided by student activity fees. 
Students pay a fee of $2.25 per 
credit hour with a maximum of 
$20. The following dollar and 
cents break-down represents the 
allocation for the 1986-87 
budgets: $1.13 - Athletic 
Department (11 intercollegiate 
sports, intramurals and 
department operations) 

.01 - Department of Fine Arts 

.18 - Day Care Center (the user 
is also charged to help defer the 
cost of equipment, supplies, 
wages, etc.) 

.09 - Purdue-Indiana Theatre 

.03 - Indiana-Purdue Forensic 
League 

.07 - Student Activity Office 
Account 

.38 - Student Government 
Office Account 

.32 -SUBOG 

.04 - Division of Music 

All of the above organizations 
(and more) operate on sizable 



budgets, but students are needed 
to help implement expenditures 
and make decisions. 

Additionally, students may be 
appointed to Student-Faculty 
committees whose decisions 
affect students and the univer- 
sity. Such committee ap- 
pointments include: Affirmative 
Action, Advisory Committee on 
Aging and the Aged, Athletics, 
Calendar, Campus Traffic 
Appeals, Handicapped Persons 
Advisory, Honor Program 
Council, Publications, 
Scholarship and Financial Aid, 
Student Affairs, University 



Resources Policy, Women's 
Studies, and the Purdue 
University Campus Appeals 
board. These committees, as well 
as Students' Government 
positions allow students to in- 
teract with campus ad- 
ministrators and faculty — talk 
about being able to express your 
opinion! 

An additional bonus of being a 
student at IPFW is the IPFW 
student discount provided to you 
by Students' Government. IPFW 
ID cardholders may take ad- 
vantage of discounts being of- 
fered at area businesses simply 



by presenting your ID card 
( check campus newsstands for a 
free listing). 

If you have any questions about 
how to specifically become in- 
volved — please contact the 
Students' Government office at 
481-6586 or the Office of Student 
Affairs Administration at 481- 
6830. We will look forward to 
hearing from you, but in the 
meantime, take that first step, 
jump into campus life and 
become involved. Good luck! 

— Joseph R. Motherwell 
Student Body President 



Alumni organizations offer 
active memberships, guidance 



Over 6,000 IPFW alumni live 
and work in Allen County. For 
students, this means an instant 
resource for career guidance, job 
information and job referral. 

The alumni associations at 
IPFW offer programs throughout 
the year in which alumni and 
students meet, talk, and share 
information. Alumni panels at 
career workshops, alumni visits 
to the classroom, and luncheon 
raps with alumni are a few of the 



ways students can network with 
IPFW alumni. 

Annually, the alumni 
associations sponsor a Student 
Leaders Recognition Program 
and provide staff support to the 
Graduating Class Council, who 
hosts the reception for the 
graduating class, raises money 
for the class gift, publishes a 
graduating class newsletter and 
elects student class represen- 
tatives for commencement. 

Last year alumni started and 



supported an IPFW Pep Band. If 
you're interested in joining the 
band, call the IPFW alumni 
office, 481-6807. 

Earning your degree at IPFW 
brings a one or two-year free 
membership in the Indiana 
University Alumni Association or 
Purdue Association, respec- 
tively. We hope you'll take the 
initiative and continue your ties 
to IPFW by staying active in your 
alumni associations.

A Statement of Students' Rights and Responsibilities^ 



SECTION I. STUDENT RIGHTS 
AND RESPONSIBILITIES 

1.1 Students should have accurate and plainly stated 
information relating to the maintenance of acceptable 
academic standing, graduation requirements, and in- 
dividual course objectives and requirements (see the IPFW 
Bulletin). 

1.2 Student records will be maintained in keeping with the 
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, further 
amendments and the HEW guidelines for implementation. 

1.3 In all academic evaluations, and in instances of 
academic discipline, the student has the right to fair and 
impartial treatment. 

1.4 

(a) Students may establish, issue, and distribute — 
consistent with appropriate regulations concerning the 
time, place, and manner of distribution — student-directed 
publications which are in no way published under the 
auspices of the university and are published without any 
financial support from the university. Such regulations 
shall not be designed to restrict student access to these 
publications on university property. 

(b) Student-directed publications which are published 
under university auspices shall be free of censorship. The 
university shall honor this freedom by publicly recognizing 
and protecting the student editors' and managers' right to 
establish editorial policies — within the bounds of 
prevailing legal standards and standards of journalism. 
Specifically, student editors or managers may not be 
suspended or removed in response to pressure by external 
groups disagreeing with their editorial policies. 

1.5 Students have the right to freedom from unlawful 
discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or 
national origin. 

1.6 Students shall have the opportunity to participate in 
the formulation of policy directly affecting students 
through membership on appropriate committees as 
determined by the chancellor and the president of the 
university. 

1.7 Students should be free from illegal searches and 



seizures. Specific policies authorize searches on Univer- 
sity property, such as residence halls and libraries, among 
others. 
1.8 

(a) The university will not interfere with the rights of 
students to join associations which promote their common 
interests as students. 

(b) Student organizations holding a fiscal-legal 
relationship with the university are subject to university 
policies, procedures, and regulations pertaining to such 
organizations. 

1.9 

(a) Indiana University considers freedom of inquiry and 
discussion essential to a student's educational develop- 
ment. Thus, the university recognizes the right of all 
students to engage in discussion, to exchange thought and 
opinion, and to speak, write, or print freely on any subject, 
in accordance with the guarantees of federal and state 
constitutions. This broad principle is a cornerstone of 
education in a democracy. 

(b) For their programs student groups on the campus 
may freely select persons they wish to invite as guest 
speakers or performers. There are no restrictions on the 
point of view expressed by speakers other than those im- 
posed by national or state law. The invitation to an outside 
speaker does not imply approval or sponsorship of the 
speaker's views by the university nor by the group inviting 
the speaker. 

(c) University facilities are designed to accommodate the 
scheduled activities of the university, to accommodate the 
extracurricular activities of student groups, and to ac- 
commodate visitors and guests of the university. From 
time to time, as extraordinary requests may justify, 
facilities may be made available for programs of various 
kinds sponsored by non-university groups, especially for 
charitable or civic purposes. 

(d) The university does not make its facilities available 
for fund-raising purposes if the funds are designated to 
enrich an individual or commercial sponsor. 

(e) The university's facilities ordinarily will be 
unavailable for the purpose of providing entertainment of a 



kind that is available in the outside community and is 
competitive with it. 

(f) The university reserves the right to control its 
facilities to assure that events held are compatible with its 
prime purpose of serving the university community by 
making available to it programs that appear to enhance its 
cultural and educational opportunities. 

(g) The university will at all times seek to assure student 
and faculty groups the opportunity to meet and to hear and 
exchange ideas and views, however controversial, but it 
does not license and will not tolerate what is illegal. 

1.10 Students are free to engage in peaceful and orderly 
protest, demonstration, and picketing which does not 
disrupt functions of the university. 

1.11 Students have the right to freely exercise their full 
rights as citizens. In this light, the university affirms the 
right to students to exercise their freedoms without 
university interference or fear of university sanction for 
such activity. 

1.12 As members of the academic community, students 
have an obligation to that community and to the preser- 
vation of the academic process. As citizens, students have 
the responsibility to know and obey the laws of the United 
States, the State of Indiana, and of local governments. 
Student status in no way exempts them from the 
requirements of obeying such laws. 

1.13 

(a) The following actions constitute misconduct for which 
students may be penalized, by such sanctions as described 
in 1.13 (c), when committed on university property: 

(1) Actions which endanger the student, the university 
community, or the academic process. 

(2) Conduct that is made a crime by the criminal law of 
the State of Indiana or the United States of America, that 
takes place on university property or in the course of a 
university activity. 

(3) Unauthorized taking or possession of University 
property or services or the property or services of others. 

(4) Academic dishonesty, such as cheating and

circumstances of the allegedly wrongful conduct. The 
notice shall require the student to appear in the office of the 
dean at a time and on a date specified (which ordinarily will 
will not be earlier than three days after the mailing of the 
notice) to discuss the alleged violations, 
(c) The notice shall inform the student of the following: 

(1) The offense the student is alleged to have committed 
by citing the relevant section of this code; 

(2) The date, time, and place of alleged commission, and 
other relevant circumstances; 

(3) The date, time, and place of the conference to discuss 
the alleged violation; 

&lt; 4) That the student may have an advisor or other counsel 
at the conference; 

(5) That the student need not answer questions and that a 
choice to remain silent will not be taken as an admission of 
guilt; 

(6) That, if the student fails to appear for the conference, 
the dean may: (a) reschedule the conference; (b) dismiss 
the charges; or (c) if the dean reasonably believes the 
failure to be inexcusable, impose any of the disciplinary 
penalties described under Section I, paragraph 1.13 (c). 

(7) That many disciplinary penalties imposed under the 
circumstances noted in paragraph (6) above shall be 
subject to further hearing or appeal, but the fact of the 
student's failure to appear at the conference, if unjustified, 
may be weighed as a factor in future hearings. 

2.3 Student's Response to Charge: Disposition Without 
Hearing 

(a) When the student appears as required, the dean shall 
inform the student as fully as possible of the facts alleged. 
The student may, but need not, make responses and ex- 
planations. 

(b) If, after discussion and such further investigation as 
may be necessary, the dean determines that the violation 
alleged is not supported by the evidence, the dean shall 
dismiss the accusation and notify the student. 

(c) If, after discussion, or if the student fails to appear, 
and if the dean is satisfied that the violation occurred as 
alleged, the dean shall so notify the student and shall 
propose a penalty by means of a written notice. The 
student, by such notice, shall be offered the choice either of 
consenting to the determination and proposed penalty or of 
requesting a hearing before a hearing commission. Should 
a student desire a hearing before a hearing commission, the 
request shall be made in writing and delivered to the dean 
on or before a date specified in the notice that proposes the

hearing commission to accommodate observers if a 
hearing is to be public, and the hearing commission's 
choice of place and determination of the number of ob-

members, shall maintain necessary order and shall make 
all rulings necessary for the fair, orderly, and expeditious 
conduct of the hearing. The hearing commission may

tinuance of the hearing. The hearing commission shall 
provide a taped transcript of all proceedings, which 
transcript shall be maintained for a period of one year. 

( f ) Copies of all communications pertaining to the alleged 
offense from the dean of student services to a student whose

the commission voting. 

(h) The Hearing Commission shall make a finding 
whether the student has committed the offense(s) as 
charged. If the Hearing Commission finds that the student

any disciplinary record the student may have, impose one 
of the disciplinary penalties enumerated under Section I 
1.13(c). of this Statement. 

(i) Within ten days after the conclusion of the hearing, the 
hearing commission shall render a written decision and

memorandum stating the reason(s) for believing the 
decision improper, not later than seven days after the date

officer of the review board and the student involved (if 
necessary).

(2) that either may submit written statements to the 
review board and to one another, before the appeal 
hearing;

based on the record to the review board, or that the 
respective advisor or other counsel may do so; 

(4) that the appeal hearing will be closed to the public, 
unless otherwise requested by the student at least five days 
before the hearing; 

(5) that the review board will not accept additional 
evidence, but will consider only the record of the previous

Arts and crafts 
room open 
to students 



The arts and crafts room is a unique feature of the IPFW 
campus. Located in Walb Memorial Union 214 and 218 it 
offers a variety of resources: a darkroom for black-and- 
white photography, weaving looms, lapidary and 
silkscreening equipment, a large ceramics area that in- 
cludes potter's wheels and an electric kiln, a drawing and 
painting area, and a woodworking shop which houses 
motorized saws, a drill press, and other basic equipment for 
carpentry. All students, faculty, staff, and alumni of IPFW 
are invited to use the room and its facilities, free of charge. 

The room is designed as a comfortable setting for those 
wishing to take a break from the everyday stress of classes, 
studies, and-or work. It also provides an accessible place 
for students to work on their school-related projects such as 
graphs, posters, illustrations, etc. A creative atmosphere is 
offered for those wanting to learn about art, yet who never 
before had such a wide range of facilities at their disposal. 

Although the arts and crafts room provides much of the 
necessary equipment, those wishing to use the facilities 
must furnish the consumable materials. For example, 
those interested in ceramics must purchase clay and 



glazes. Those who want to print photographs must buy 
photographic paper and chemicals. Lockers, in the hallway 
adjacent to the craft room, are recommended for personal 
art-supply storage. A list of local art-supply stores is on 
display in the crafts room. 

During an average week, approximately 50-75 people use 
the room. The time between Thanksgiving and Christmas is 
the busiest, since many students and staff make use of the 
facilities for gifts. Here's just a sampling of what has come 
out of the crafts room: stereo speakers, silk-screened 
Christmas cards, a silver ring and bracelet set, matching 
end tables, a ceramic dinnerware set, silk-screened T- 
shirts, loom-woven wool scarves, and life-sized Indian-chief 
sculpture. 

The crafts room is physically accessible to the disabled, 
and the staff believes art to be an important and vital outlet 
for them. Since each student receives individual attention, 
each is encouraged to work at her or his own level of 
achievement. Blind students have made beautiful ceramic 
and sculpture pieces; paraplegics have been involved in 
woodworking and photography. 



Indiana University Rights cont. from page 11 

(c) The review board shall be composed of a student 
appointed by the appropriate president of the student body, 
a faculty member appointed by the Fort Wayne (Faculty) 
Senate, and an administrative officer appointed by the chief 
administrative officer of a campus. The administrative 
member shall serve as chair. 

(d) The members of the review board shall hold office 
from the first day of the fall semester for a term of one 
year, but they shall complete the review of any case which 
they have begun to consider. No member may serve more 
than two consecutive terms. If any vacancy on the review 
board occurs because of the failure or refusal of ap- 
propriate authorities to make recommendations to fill 
vacancies, the chancellor may make appointments to fill 
vacancies, or take such other action necessary to constitute 
the review board. 

(e) No hearing shall be held unless all members of the 
review board are present. If any member of the review 
board is unable to serve or should excuse himself-herself 
from serving, another review board member shall be ap- 
pointed in accordance with the provisions of sections (c) 
and (d) above. 

(f) The presiding officer of the review board, in con- 
sultation with other members, shall maintain necessary 
order and shall make all rulings necessary for the fair, 
orderly, and expeditious conduct of the appeal hearing. 
Decisions by the review board shall be by majority vote 
only. 

(g) The review board will listen to the recorded tape of 
the hearing commission, and then on the basis of that and 
oral arguments, written statements, and a review of the 
evidence presented at the appeal hearing, the review board 
must render a decision within twenty days of the hearing 
and may: , 

(1) Affirm the original decision which shall be effective 
as of the date specified by the hearing commission. 

(2) Affirm the original decision (and reduce penalty) 
whicb shall be effective as of the date specified by the 
hearing commission. 

(3) Reverse the decision. 

(4) Disallow the decision and order a new hearing. 

(h) The decision of the review board shall be sent to the 
dean, who shall notify the student and proceed ap- 
propriately. 

2.6 Failure to Appear 

If a student notified to appear before the dean or before a 
hearing commission fails to comply and if the dean or the 
hearing commission reasonably believes that the violation 
occurred as alleged, the dean or the hearing commission 
shall so notify the student and shall propose an appropriate 
sanction by means of written notice. When an extension of 
time appears necessary to avoid undue hardship or in- 
justice, the dean may extend the time to enable a student to 
respond to an accusation or prepare a defense. 

2.7 Summary Action 

Summary suspension of a student and exclusion from 
university property may be imposed without the hearing 
procedure provided for in this Section, but only by the 
president of the university upon the recommendation of the 
chancellor. The president shall first be satisfied that the 
continued status as a student upon the campus seriously 
threatens harm to the student or to any other person or the 
property of the university or of others. A student so 
suspended may be required to leave the property of the 
university and may be notified that he-she will thereafter be 
treated as a trespasser if he-she returns. A student notified 
of such a suspension may, within ten days after receipt of 
such notice, request a hearing before a hearing com- 
mission, as provided in this Section, to determine whether 
the summary suspension is justified or whether the person 
should be reinstated. 

2.8 Whenever disciplinary action is initiated by the dean 
against a student under the age of eighteen, the dean shall 
make reasonable efforts to assure that the parentis &gt; or, 
where applicable, other legal guardian of the student is 



notified that the action is pending. 

SECTION III. ACADEMIC DUE PROCESS 

Preamble 

Faculty and students alike have rights and respon- 
sibilities for learning, teaching, and scholarship within the 
entire university community. Academic functions are 
characterized by reasoned discourse, intellectual honesty, 
mutual respect, and openness to constructive change. In- 
dividuals must remain active in avoiding violations of 
academic ethics. 

3.1 Definitions of Academic Misconduct; Student 
Misconduct 

(a) Cheating — Dishonesty of any kind with respect to 
examinations, course assignments, alteration of records^or 
illegal possession of examinations shall be considered 
cheating. 

It is the responsibility of the studentnot only to absta in 
from cheating but, in addition, to guard against making it 
possible for others to cheat. Any student who helps another 
student to cheat is as guilty of cheating as the student he or 
she assists. The student should also do everything possible 
to induce respect for the examining process and for honesty 
in the performance of assigned tasks in or out of class. 

(b) Plagiarism — Honesty requires that any ideas or 
materials taken from another source for either written or 
oral use must be fully acknowledged. Offering the work of 
someone else as one's own is plagiarism. The language or 
ideas thus taken from another may range from isolated 
formulas, sentences, or paragraphs to entire articles copied 
from books, periodicals, speeches, or the writings of other 
students. The offering of materials assembled or collected 
by others in the form of projects or collections without 
acknowledgment also is considered plagiarism. Any 
student who fails to give credit for ideas or materials that 
he-she takes from another source is guilty of plagiarism. 

3.2 Faculty Responsibilities 

The faculty and the trustees of Indiana University have 
affirmed specific responsibilities of academic appointees. 
These responsibilities are contained in the Code of 
Academic Ethics which is included in the Indiana 
University Academic Handbook. The Code of Academic 
Ethics also provides procedures for enforcement of these 
responsibilities. These responsibilities include, among 
others: 

(1) A teacher will maintain a clear connection between 
the advance description and the conduct and content of 
each course presented to ensure efficient subject selection 
by students. 

(2) A teacher will clearly state the course goals and will 
inform students of testing and grading systems; moreover, . 
these systems should be intellectually justifiable and 
consistent with the rules and regulations of the academic 
division. 

(3) A teacher will plan and regulate class time with an 
awareness of its value for every student and will meet 
classes regularly. 

(4) A teacher will remain available to students and will 
announce and keep liberal office hours at hours convenient 
to students. 

(5) A teacher will strive to develop among students 
respect for others and their opinions by demonstrating his 
or her own respect for each student as an individual. 

(6) A teacher will strive to generate a proper respect for 
an understanding of academic freedom by students. At the 
same time a teacher will emphasize high standards and 
strive to protect students from irrelevant and trivial in- 
terruptions or diversions. 

(7) Since letters of evaluation written by a teacher may 
be uniquely important documents in both the academic and 
post-university life of a student, each teacher will strive to, 
make such letters both candid and fair. 

3.3 Due Process for Academic Misconduct 

(a) Student Misconduct 

(1) A faculty member who has evidence that a student is 
guilty of cheating or plagiarism shall initiate the process of 
determining the student's guilt or innocence. 



( 2) No penalty shall be imposed until the student has been 
informed of the charge and of the evidence upon which it is 
based and has been given an opportunity to present his 
defense. 

(3) If the faculty member finds the student guilty, he-she 
will assess a penalty within the class and shall promptly 
report the case in writing to the department chair and the 
academic head of the school or division. The penalty shall 
be in accordance with 3.4, the Actions section of Academic 
Due Process. 

(4) If the faculty member and the student cannot agree on 
the facts pertaining to the charge, or if a student wishes to 
appeal a penalty, the issue may be taken to the department 
chair. Each party will present his-her case to the chair who 
shall then call a meeting of all involved parties. If the issue 
is not resolved in the meeting with the chair, then either 
party may appeal the decision to the academic head of the 
school or division and the decision of the academic head to 
the dean of the faculty who shall convene an ad-hoc all- 
campus joint faculty and student academic review board 
from the appropriate academic disciplines, consisting of 
three faculty members appointed by the faculty Senate and 
two. students appointed by the student body president. 

(b) If a student believes that a faculty member has 
violated the Code of Academic Ethics, the student may 
initiate a complaint in accordance with the "Enforcement 
Procedures" specified in the Code of Academic Ethics. 
Such complaints should be brought to the attention of an 
appropriate chair or dean, or to the dean of the faculty or a 
deputy; the dean of the faculty shall provide for con- 
fidential representations regarding such violations. 

3.4 Actions 

(a) A penalty affecting a student's grade in a course may 
be imposed by the faculty member in whose course the 
offense occurred. The faculty member is responsible for 
making proper notification to the department chair con- 
cerned and to the academic head of the school or division, 
who shall report the action taken to the dean of student 
services for inclusion in a confidential file designed to 
provide a record that will develop information concerning 
students who have repeated offenses. For cases of repeated 
violation, the dean, after appropriate review with the dean 
of the faculty, may initiate disciplinary action. 

(b) In cases of student academic misconduct, the 
following actions are recommended: 

(DA student's grade in a course will be lowered when the 
student is found guilty of dishonesty on any assignment, 
examination, or paper. 

(2) An incomplete may be given in the course in the event 
any case cannot be resolved before final grades are due in 
the registrar's office. 

(3) Upon approval by the academic head of the school or 
division, the student may be transferred from the section in 
which the student is enrolled to another section of the same 
course. 

(4) Cases involving violations of academic ethics outside 
of a class, such as the selling of term papers, must be 
referred to the dean of student services. 

(5) In cases where disciplinary violations under Ser'ion I, 
paragraph 13 (a), have occurred simultaneously with 
violations of academic conduct, the Section I offense will be 
heard according to the procedures in Section II, 
Disciplinary Procedures. 

(6) By a two-thirds vote, the all-campus review board 
(see 3.3 (a) (4) ) may recommend to the chancellor that the 
student be disenrolled from the academic or professional 
school in which the student is enrolled.

Greek life broadens campus experiences 



College is a whirlwind of activity. In its boundaries lie 
opportunities leading to the new and unknown, op- 
portunities to help you grow and discover yourself and your 
potential. 

A college education is not just a four-year classroom 
experience, but also a time of personal growth and 
development. You'll meet all types of people and become 
exposed to all types of lifestyles. You may find much you 
once believed in to be challenged, and those things you once 
took for granted may no longer be so easily ignored. 

In the middle of this new-found activity, you may find 
yourself lost, with no place to turn for help. 

As a result, you may find it desirable to seek within the 
university a smaller community with which to share. A 
sorority or fraternity provides just this — a base from 
which you can become involved and grow. 

Within the Greek system, a special kind of growth takes 
place, one that is rarely found in any other campus activity. 
You learn about yourself through interactions and close 
friendships in your sorority or fraternity and among other 
Greeks, and can use these experiences as a foundation for 
participation in the many other facets of university life. 

In no other campus group does a community exist for the 
sole purpose of enhancing individuality. 

Through the Greek system, you are given a better chance 
to become involved, to grow, and to develop lasting 
friendships. 

SCHOLARSHIP is what college is all about. Greek 
organizations encourage members to grow intellectually 



and to achieve academic excellence, with the aid of 
scholarship committees and study buddies. 

LEADERSHIP experiences offered by the Greek system 
at IPFW range from chapter and Panhellenic Council of- 
fices to committees and student government. 
Encouragement to get involved with activities is supplied 
by many of the Greek organizations to their members. 

ACTIVITIES for Greeks at IPFW include a variety of 
social events which give many fun-filled memories as well 
as the experience of being part of your school's activities. 
The events range from formal to informal dances, 
fraternity socials, Greek week, and the annual Harbor 
Arbor Day Festival and Three Rivers Festival. 

The list of social events and the opportunities to meet new 
friends and develop social awareness and skills are sub- 
stantial. 

PHILANTHROPICS are an important part of Greek life. 
Each organization has a national philanthropy which it 
supports. Members are asked to donate their time for 
service and to help raise money for their charity. A suc- 
cessful philanthropic endeavor takes dedication, patience 
and time, but rewards every member of the chapter. 

There are two sororities —Pi Beta Phi and Delta Gamma 
— and three fraternities — Sigma Phi Epsilon, Phi Kappa 
Theta, and Delta Sigma Pi. 

Rush information will be available at the student services 
office in Walb Memorial Union after August 23.

Multipurpose Building. Any individual or group can form a 
team for any of the team activities. Please submit your 
ideas, requests, or suggestions for team or individual sports 
and physical fitness-activity needs. 

Equipment is available for individual or group use on 
campus. Bring an ID to check out equipment for volleyball, 
basketball, football, softball, and other activities. 

Another popular facility on campus is the parcourse, a 
walking, jogging, exercise course located east of the 
Multipurpose Building. 

Other activities outside of the intercollegiate programs 
include a club sport program. The primary goal is to 
provide our students, faculty, and staff the opportunity to 
participate in some form of activity according to varied 
abilities and interests. 

Diet, conditioning, jogging, and weight-training 
programs are available for those who desire a formal 
program for physical fitness. These programs can be ob- 
tained through the first aid and health information office in 
the Multipurpose Building.
