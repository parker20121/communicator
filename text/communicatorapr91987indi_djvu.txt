Election postponed 
by two weeks 

By MICHELE R. SHAFFER 
Edttor-ln-Chler 

The Students' Government has agreed to postpone student elections by two 
weeks, thus pushing the election back lo April 21 and 22. 

The agreement was made in accordance with a constitutional amendment ap- 
proved at the April 1 meeting. The amendment also allows student senate mem- 
bers not up tor election to act in the place of an Election Board to publicize elec- 
tions. The amendment was authored by Student Senator Dave Brown in light ot the 
constitutional bylaws violated in the administration of (his year's elections. 

The violated bylaws include the following: 

— The President must submit nominations for the Election Board to the Student 
Senate six weeks prior lo the election. 

— Student Senators shall screen and approve five Election Board members and 
two alternates four weeks prior to the election. 

— The Student Senate shall announce the Election Board members and their 
alternates no laier than six weeks prior lo the election date. 

— The Election Board shall publicize one month before the election Ihe positions 
up for election, the time and place of the election, the qualifications for voters, the 
campaign spending limits for candidates seeking elected offices, 

— The Election Board must receive completed petitions no later than one week 
prior to the general elections. 

The amendment which will be added to the section ot the Constitution labeled 
"Special Circumstances," reads in part: "Should violations ot the election 
procedure be discovered prior to the regular election, the Student Senate may, by a 
vote of one more than half the current members of Senate, postpone the regular 
election at least one week but no more than two weeks. In such ease, the Student 
Senate members and Executive officers who are not up for re-election, may act in 
the stead. of Ibe Election Board members in order to publicize Ihe postponed 
election. Election Board members shall retain the rest of their duties as 
enumerated in this Constituion." 

Due to the failure ot Student Body President Joe Motherwell and other members 
of Students' Government to submit names for an Election Board, the election was 
behind schedule about five weeks. The elections were originally slated for April 7 
and 8. Announcements for the election were not posted in campus buildings until 
theweekof March 30. The Election Board was not announced to the Student Senate 
until the week before that. Motherwell said he had tried lo gel students lo serve on 
the Election Board, but. he said, as in years past, no one was interested in per- 
forming the task. 

The amendment was passed to allow Students' Government members to act in 
the stead ot the Election Board because the members were not previously allowed 
to perform those duties according to the Constitution. 

"Hopefully, I the amendment) will Uke care ot the problems that have surfaced 
and will satisfy all *he candidates and potenLal candidates," Student Body Vice 
President Gina Kostotf said. 

"It's unfortunate that I the violations) happened, however we are taking steps to 
correct the situation," she said. 

Kostoff said the senate plans to post advertisements around campus this week. 
She said that Ihe deadline forcandidales lo submit their completed petitions to run 
tor office is I'uesday, April 14. 



Adair finds niche while teaching in '78 



By GINA M. JONES 
Managing Editor 




Adair 



director ot career 
services, found 
her niche al IPFW 
while leaching al 
South Side High 
School. As a 
matter of fact, 
Adair. who 
started her 
teaching here on a 
part-time basis, 
said she was not 



looking for a job at the time. 

Marian Adair began her career at 
IPFW in 1978. Adair started out by 
leaching a career-planning class. After 
the grant was written for the Job 
Location Service, Adair began working 
part time She later worked as a 



counselor, advising students on 
personal, as well as career level. She 
then became assistant director of 
career services only to move up to her 
current position as director of career 
services. 

How did Adair get her start in the 
IPFW faculty? "I was a volunteer at 
Soulh Side High School in career 
development, and the director of 
placement at IPFW observed my class 
and offered me the position I wasn't 
even looking for a job," Adair said. 

Adair holds a bachelor's degree in 
Spanish-English, a master's degree in 
English, and a doctorate in higher 
education administration. All degrees 
were obtained al Indiana University in 
Bloominglon. 

Awards and honors bestowed on 
Adair include the Pi Lambda Theto - 
education honorary award. Adair also 
received another education honorary 



award from the Delta Kappa Gamma 
Society. 

Adair received a service award from 
the Indiana Personal Guidance 
Association. She served on the IPFW 
Career Development Task Force from 
1978-83, and in 1983 was awarded a 
certificate lor her assistance to 
disabled students. 

What can students do toenhance their 
chances of succeeding in their career 
choice? "First they need lo try and get 
work experience. Either in the form of 
an internship, co-op program, part- 
time job, or volunteer work. It will give 
you an edge upon graduation on your 
resumes," Adair said. "Second, it will 
also help a student confirm, or reject, a 
career choice. Third, use every service 
you can gel your hands on lo prepare 
tor the job search. Finally, choose a 
career you tike, rather than one tor the

Speech and Hearing Club's efforts 
help finance boy's ear surgery 



ByDEBIIARMENING 

Copy Editor 

Efforts from the IPFW Speech and 

Hearing Club have been instrumental 
inhelping a Fort Wayne boy regain his 
hearing. 

Ten-year-old Michael Duncan, deaf 
since Ihe age of three because of spinal 
meningitis and German measles, un- 
derwent cochlear-implant surgery on 
Feb. 10 at Rileys Children's Hospital in 
Indianapolis. Part of the money 
essential to the operation was raised at 
a bowl-a-lhon in January sponsored by 
the Speech and Hearing Club and the 
audiology and speech sciences 
department al IPFW, 

The operation in February, which 
entailed placing an artificial device in 
Ihe cochlear area of the ear allowing 
soundslobelransmilted to the auditory 
nerve, was 100 percent successful. 




In April, Michael will undergo 
another operation in which an outer coil 
will be attached lo the first Implant and 
will pick up sound vibrations and send 
them lo the eighth cranial nerve. 

Although Michael relies on signing as 
his main form of communication,, the 
second operation will allow him lo 
interpret the signals sent to the eighth 
cranial nerve and improve his com- 



munication skills. 

Michael's operation and 2-year 
follow-up rehabilitation program will 
cost about $24,000. Because the Dun- 
cans' medical Insurance would only 
cover the bills for the hospital stay, 
Michael's parents, David and Vicki, 
were forced to seek outside help 
through fund-raising projects. 

The IPFW Speech and Hearing Club 
raised a toUl of (1,550 to help defray 
some of the medical expenses through 
the bowl-a-lhon they sponsored in 
January, Pledges from bowling pins 
knocked down accounted for tSOO ot the 
total and tISO came from private 
donations. 

"It It weren't for our bowling to 
promote this, those pledges never could 
have even come about," said Yvonne 
Kachuk. a representative of the Speech 
and Hearing Club. 



money. You'll be much happier,' 
said. 

"Also the more involvement in 
college on the students' part the better. 
The more one gives, the better the 
college experience will be. Things are 
happening fast, have a say in il," she 
said,

Thursday. April 9, I9gi 



Students must be priority 
to newly elected leader 



Making the best of a very bad 
situation. 

Tliat is whal the Students' 
Government appears lo be doing by 
approving the postponement of Students' 
Government elections by two weeks. 
Gina Kosloff, student body vice 
president, presented the proposal 
because the election was running about 
five weeks behind schedule and students 
wanting to run for office were left with 
very little time to get their petitions 
filled and actively campaign. Students 
other than members of Students' 
Government did not even know about the 
election until about one week before the 
originally scheduled election dates 
(April 7 and 8). 

At least five bylaws of the Students' 
Government Constitution were violated 
in the administration of this year's 
election. However, all of these were a 
result of the first violation committed: 
the failure of the student body president 
to nominate an election board six weeks 
prior to the scheduled election. The other 
violations, which concerned the 
responsibilities of the election board to 
- publicize and administer the election, 
consequently followed suit. 

There are any number of valid (or 
invalid: reasons as lo why and how 
things got so behind. Joe Motherwell 
waited too long in naming an election 
board. There has clearly been no 
argument to that. Perhaps he was busy 
with the dozen or so committees on 
which he serves. Maybe he was, as most 
students are, busy studying and 
preparing for graduation or graduate 
school. Perhaps he was busy 
campaigning for the student trustee 
position on the I.U Board of Trustees, 
Maybe all of the above. 

It's no secret nor a surprise that the 
student body president is a hectic, 
responsibility-filled position to have. 
However, he still had an obligation as 
student body president to name the 
election board. Even if he received little 
or no help from others in his 
administration, the bylaws of the 
Constitution clearly name him as being 
responsible for naming the election 
board and thus getting the election 
rolling. 

Nevertheless, the Student Senate 
passed an amendment last week, in 
addition to the postponement, that does 
f;;"iittle more than slap Motherwell's hands 
for such behavior. The amendment gives 
an OK for Student Senate to begin 
publicizing an election in the event that 
an election board does not get named in 
time to do so. 

Even though this is commendable, it 
solves no problems Rather, it is a 
bandage to cover-up future violations of 



the Constitution and its bylaws. What 
this type of an amendment really says is 
that it is OK to forgo duties explicated in 
the Constitution and its bylaws because 
the Student Senate will just pick up the 
slack. 

A real solution to prevent further 
problems like this would be to set up a 
reporting procedure between the student 
body president and the Students' 
Government advisor. For example, if 
elections are slated for the first Tuesday 
and Wednesday of April, an election 
board is required to be named by the 
third or fourth week in February, Recent 
history has shown it takes a lot of 
persuasion on the president's part to 
recruit students lo serve on the election 
board. Therefore, the recruitment 
should begin around the second week of 
January: the first week of classes of the 
spring semester. With that sort of 
schedule, a report on the efforts to 
recruit people lo serve on the board 
could be made lo the Students' 
Government advisor two weeks later. If 
problems exist, several weeks remain to 
work them out and still find people to 
serve on the board before its 
membership has lo be announced to the 
Student Senate, 

Even though this campus has seen 
some very positive changes in the last 
Iwo years as a direct result of efforts by 
Mothenvell's various committees, these 
cannot diminish the seriousness of 
recent Constitution violations. Elections 
are not something to mess around with. 

We are all busy. That is 
understandable. Our responsibilities 
must still be met. Blaming the delay on 
other people or because of your 
commitments is not acceptable. This 
was Motherwell's second time around as 
president. He knew the problems and 
hassles of getting people to serve on the 
Election Board, Procrastination was not 
an appropriate answer to those 
problems and hassles. The students 
wanting to run deserve more. 

As of this past Tuesday, the originally 
scheduled and advertised election day. 
there still was not any announcement as 
to the postponement and rescheduling of 
the student election. Another case of 
procrastination? 

We hope this year, with the 
postponement of the elections, 
candidates have been afforded ample 
time to properly campaign. We hope that 
this year, April 21 and 22. the IPFW 
student body will vote for a student 
president who is willing to put the needs 
of the IPFW student body before 
anything else 

All we can do is hope.

I want my CNN 

To the Editor: 

1 am appalled when 1 waltz 
through the student union or 
Classroom Medical Building, 
and find all the television 
dials set on MTV! Grow up 
folks. You're in college now. 

Almost daily this 
academic year. I've sat 
down between classes to 
talch a glimpse of local or 
coble news only to be besel 
with a l)3rrage ot nasty 
remarks or hostile protests. 
Enough is enough! I've paid 
my lees, too, and I refuse to 
be subjected to blaring 
music coupled with eye- 
straining videos when I have 
3 choice in the matter. 

You might ask: "If you 
loathe MTV so much, why 
don't you just get up, assert 
your rights, and change the 
stupid channel?" My reply 
is: I've tried and I would 
have succeeded had it not 
been for a few people 
monopolizing the TV sels 
and ignoring the tact that the 
sels are IPFW property. 

It appears this group is 
comprised of giggly girU 
whosit and discuss the latest 
look in hair comlis while 
boys complain (between 
videos, ot course!) ot a lest 
or professor, but rarely open 
their books to validate their 
claims. These tew make it 
impossible tor other students 
lo enjoy something artsy or 
wiucallonal on cable. In- 
stead, they boldly offer you 
an ultimatum: watch MW 
or leave. I leave. 

It sickens me to see these 
boys and girls "Oooing," and 
"Aahing" over Tina Tur- 
ner's legs or David L*e 
liolh's mid-air splits in light 



? knocked into these young, 
naive heads unless it comes 
from drug-crazed rockers or 
jockers lelling tasteless 
jokes alK)ut tasteless bands, 
I am appealing lo the rest of 
the student body. We've all 
paid for the right to use the 
sets and they shouldn't be 
monopolized by a few with 
zip authority! 

My point isn't to chastise 
tliese untoruiiate tew. In the 
long run, they are the losers, 
tor while I'm burying my 
nose in Plato's Itepublic, 
they'jre being educated by 
the likes of Cheap Trick and 
Van Ha ten. However, the 
school-owned TVs are nol the 
exclusive jurisdiction of a 
few, but available to all 
students — young and older 
alike, 

I also want lo call attention 
lo the issue of values. Con- 
siderlhis. 11 you spend three 
hours of potential study lime 
watching twenty videos, then 
what the heck are you doing 
in college? 

College means education, 
which in turn means work — 
nol free rides. Even if the 
system of higher education 
has flaws, and functions 
under the limitations of a 
typical bureaucracy, it's still 
theoretically a place ol 
learning. 

College is a place lo grow 
mtoa responsible adult who 
is able to make intelligent 
decisions. Yes, somelimes 
those decisions involve 
quality lime (i.e. choosing 
between spending hours 
glued to MTV, or brain- 
storming with friends about 
an upcoming project I. 11 
comes down lo choices. 
Yours and mine. 

I vole against MTV.

Motherwell 
needs credit 

To Ihe Editor: 

IPFW is, in large part, a 
commuter campus geared 
toward those people who are 
employed full time; some 
raising families and desiring 
lo enhance their career 
opportunities by obUining 
post-secondary education on 
a part-time basis with 
evening classes. When 1 
returned to IPFW in 19M 
after a five year absence, I 
was then included in this 
group ot students comprising 
a larger part of IPFW's 
student body. I quickly 
discovered several flaws in 
Ihe University's setup that 
discriminated against this 
large group. 

Upon my return, 1 
originally paid partial and 
then full student activity tecs 
even though with my work, 
school, and studying 
schedule 1 wasn't able to 
take advantage ot Ihe many 
aciivities that IPFW had to 
otter. I would have enjoyed 
utilizing the multi-purpose 
liuilding though, tor working 
out and running ihe track. 
However, it wasn't open in 
tlie evenings for me lo do so. 
Suddenly, ihe hours were 
extended with convenient 
evening and weekend hours. 
I discovered that this change 
came about in large part 
tlirough the ettorts ot the 
Sludenl Body President, 
Joseph Molherwell. 

Another discrimination 
against evening students is 
Uie current library hours. 
Since it is only open until 
10:30 p.m. during the week, 
the only time 1 could utilize 
tlie library effectively is on 



Ihe weekends. I recently 
found out that the library 
hours will not only be ex- 
tended until midnight during 
the week, but also later on 
the weekends effective April 
13, 1987. I learned that this 
change also came about 
through the efforts of Mr. 
Motherwell 

Another disappointment 
encountered upon my return 
to academia at IPFW was 
that the HPER classes were 
no longer available for 
credit, offered only through 
Continuing Education. Some 
ot these elates will be 
reinstated, hopefully this 
fall. Who is largely 
responsible'' Again, Mr. 
Mothenvell, 

These are only a tew major 
changes I am aware ot that 
have come about during Mr, 
Motherwell's term in office, 
1 speak for many of Ihe 
students in my position when 
I say that I teel Mr. 
Molherwell has done an 
outstanding job as Student 
Body President, working 
toward equity for all 
students. 



This is why I was in- 
furiated when, upon reading 
the April 2. 1997 issue of The 
Communicator there was yet 
another article with 
derogatory comments on 
Mr. Motherwell's ef- 
fectiveness. It wasn't Ihe 
first that I have read. A 
president can be only as good 
as his or her constituents. 
The article clearly states 
that Mr, "Molherwell said he 
tried about a month ago to 
recruit students lo serve on 
the Election Board, but no 
one was interested in doing 

I don't understand why the 
editor never seems lo have 
anything good to say aliout 
our Student Body President; 
when he has done such an 
excellent job. It seems that 
Ihe editor is extremely 
prejudiced against him. In 
order to ensure equitable; 
coverage in future issui 
The Communicator one 
only look tonvard to Ihe time: 
when there is a "new face at" 
the helm" of our newspaper.

Mills offer students cheap diploma, little work 



, By RALPH HAINES 
* Slalf Writer 

. You're looking forward lo 
the day you have your 
(liploma in hand Thai 
(Uploma can be the lickel to 
success, 11 can be (he key 
(hal opens [he door to Ihc 
field you have chosen as your 
career; il can be. at the very 
(east, proof thai you have 
knowledge and expertise In a 
certain subject 

By the lime you receive 
that diploma, you will have 
put in many long hours of 
study, research and class 
lime, and il will have cost 
you lor the person who is 
putting up the money for 
your educationi a small 

But why go 10 all that 
trouble and expense? Were 
you aware thai you can 
receive a diploma without all 
that effort and cost? It's 
true. You can obtain a 
pollege diploma with little or 
no study, and at a cost 
between SIO and S2,000. All. 
you need do is fmd a diploma 
mill. 

; A twenty year study by a 
special interest group of 
Inlertel i the high IQ socielyl 
leads one to believe thai, 
although the individual 
diploma mill usually lasts 
bnly a year or two, each time 
one drops from sighl another 
t'ises to lake its place, often 
operated by Ihe same per- 
sons with only a new name or 
a new location. 

These diploma mills tend 
,lo have two methods of 
[operation: H Some pretend 
;tti offer a course, usually 
'consisting of one book, and 
ask the student to answer a 
few questions about thai 
book before the diploma is 
awarded, and 2l Others 
make no prelense of offering 
knowledge, but simply offer 
lo sell a diploma. Either of 
these "educational in- 
stilutions' may offer what is 
called 



credit 



for 



ing ex- 



perienced living 
number of years. 

There are several 
'colleges' in Ohio, Arizona, 
Florida, Missouri, Great 




and 



many 



California who offer degree 
programs in subjects 
covered by legitimate 
colleges jso (ar, no one has 
offered a Medicine Doctor 
degree, although the two 
British colleges come close 
with doctorates in 
naturopathy, homeopatliy. 

The course usually covers 
one book, with the student 
required to answer and send 
in the questions at the end of 
each chapter. ( In the case of 
the more thorough schools, a 
sheet of questions may be 
sent out.) When the student 
has completed this one 
requirement, a degree is 
given. 

If the student takes too 
long to send in his answers, 
he is often given Ihe degree 
anyway lo allow him to take 
graduale courses. A check 
with the Better Business 
Bureau &lt; this is one facet of 
an investigation by the In- 



tcrlel SIGl on one Ohio 
school,' which claimed lo 
operate a boy's home in 
conjunction with Ihe school, 
revealed the self -designated 
president lo be a child 
molesler. 

Quite a number of these 
diploma mills offer 
diplomas, without any study, 
from iheir own instilution ~ 
just send SIO or S29.95 (or 
whatever the going price is) 
and they will send you a 
diploma in whatever field 
suits your fancy. 

Perhaps the most alar- 
ming, though, IS one such 
mill which began operating 
out of a post office box in 
California over a decade ago 
offering a diploma, not only 
in the field of your choice, 
but from any one of major 
colleges and universities. 
WantaB.A. from UCLA? Or 
perhaps an M S from MIT? 
How about a Ph.D. from our 
own Indiana U? Just send 
your money (prices vary 



same type of offer was made 
from Oregon lagain a post 
office box, perhaps by the 
same persons) with a 
refinement I don't t)elieve 
llie California mill offered. 

They offered a diploma 
from any of llie major in- 
stitutions without bothering 
the customer for the 
specifications. They had all 
the formats on hand, and 
even sent, on request, a 
small catalogue listing all 
colleges and universities 
available, and pictures of 
many of their diplomas. Of 
course, they offered 'custom 
work' too, for an extra 
charge. 

While many of those above 
implied affiliation with a 
church or religion by the use 
of names such as Soandso 
Christian College or St. 
Soandso University, any 
actual church sponsorship 
was very unlikely. There 
were (and arei, however, so 
called churches that will 
ordain you as a minister of 
their little church. Most 
require a 'small donation' 
andsomewillalsogiveyoua 
the church, such as

and 



The group lasted for 
several years, but dropped 
from sight when a flurry of 
publicity apparently forced 
the California authorities lo 
take action. A while later the 



chbishop, etc.. at your 
choice, and depending on the 
■iiic of Ihe 'small donation.' 
Some of these groups also 
offer courses whereby you 
can 'earn' Ihe degree of 
Df&gt;.. Th.D or Ph.D., some 
honorary and some not. 



While not diploma milts, 
there arc institutions that 
offer courses leading lo what 
some call 'a non-traditional 
degree' in various subjects. 
Those offering vocational- 
technical subjects may serve 
very well, depending on llie 
abilities and ambitions of the 
student, especially if they 
include hands-on studies. 

Those offering more 
traditional subjects should 
be scrutinized closely There 
are several law schools 
which require no on-campus 
classes (all by correspon- 
dence), but many stales will 
not allow one to take Ihe bar 
examination unless they 
have completed an ac- 
credited law school. 

A recent article in Ihe Wall 
Street Journal pointed out 
that ol Ihe 5G students who 
completed correspondence 
courses, only two became 
lawyers Pcrliaps lite best 
rule regarding correspon- 
dence classes is; consult 
wilh your adviser t&gt;efore 
enrolling, but do not be 
hesitant to gel a second 
opinion if you are not 

You may find ad- 
vertisements for diploma 
mills in all sorts of places, 
even among listings of ac- 
credited colleges, but the 
most likely place to find such 
ads IS in the back of various 
magazines, in the classified 
sections. 



Safety procedures reviewed 



Indiana ranks fourth 
nationally in tornado-related 
deaths. This sobering fact is 
a reminder that we should 
review weather terminology

IPFW, 

A tornado watch is issued 
to alert you that conditions 
are favorable for tornado 
development. You need not 
interrupt your activities but 
be aware of the potential 
Uireat. 

A tornado warning is 
issued when a tornado has 
aciualty been sighted or 



indicated by radar. A 
warning indicates the 

location at the time of 
detection and the expected 
path of the tornado. 
University Police and Safety 
has direct radio contact with 
the National Weather Ser- 
vice and activates the in- 
ternal tornado warning 
system. This is identified by 
an intermittent buzzer sound 
for five minutes. External 
campus warnings will 
consist of public address 
announcements. When a 
tornado warning is issued.

credit he so justly deserves. 



His production players w

looks unlimited for the up-

done, and it's been a long 
way, but you're finally 
eyeball to eyeball with Dave

ahead of John Thompson and 
Lou Carnesecca 

Now. he's above the trees, 
has shed the Rodney

the shot five years ago thai 
Michael Jordan made 
against the Hoyas of 
Georgetown, and let's hope 
llie same Ihing happens to 
you, Jim. that you win the 
champipnship the following 
year." 

Whilel'malil.l'dalsolike 
lo congratulate New 
Orleans, the city did a great 



job in the hospilalily end of 
things. The championship 
game itself was a postage 
stamp, either team could 
have won it, U just so hap- 
pened to end at a lime when 
Indiana was leading, and I 
think the deciding factor was 
truly Keith Smart having a 
hot hand at the final curtain. 

I'd like lo look back now, 
at people and things that 
impressed me 

First, I'm pleased that 
Joey Meyer has popped out 
of the shadow of his legen- 
dary father, and I can'l 
iorget David Robinson, 
standing at attention after 
his final loss, while the Navy 
band which christened their 
ilagship. And who could 
forget John Cheney, my 
coach of the year. If the 
corporate world only had the 
values and intelligence of 



John, then we wouldn't have 
a deficit trade balance with 
Japan. 

Other 

last season. Dean Smith, 
with the trio of Hobson, Wolf 
and Kenny Smith showing 
class in their early swan out 
oi the NCAA tourney ... Dale 
Brown doing the miracle of 
the loaves and fishes again 
at LSU . The UCLA Bruins 
stiowing they're back, that 
the drought has ended . . The 
Iowa Hawkeyes and their 
marriage with Dr. Tom 
Davis tliat should last as long 
as the Duke of Windsor and 
Wally Simpson . lark the 
Shark having his first doubts 
about Ihe time remaining for 
him to win the Kentucky 
Derby he wants so much ... 
and Ricky Pitino lelUng his 
team -We'll cry later" after 
his infant's death. 

More memories: Lucky, 
lucky, lucky, David Rivers. 
A crunch time player with 
hlueblood class lines ... The 
heartache being over for (be 
freshmen that were down 
with Proposition 48 ... The 
fears and anxieties of the 
graduate -a'ssls^ni coaches, 
whose jobs were sacrificed 
in the political arena of the 
atlileiic directors meeting . . 



the Sham of charging money 
for seats at lite Superdome 
that would make a mugger 
look like an alter boy ... T'wo 
wrongs not making a right, 
with Memphis State winning 
the Metro and Denny Crum's 
Cardinals not being picked 
as one of the lop 64 teams in 
the country. We must get the 
selection process out of the 
hands of power brokers in 
smoke-filled rooms. 

But to sum up. in spite of 
many things, I've enjoyed it, 
I enjoy doing these columns, 
I know lots of times I offend, 
but I'm a guy that works on 
the docks, incites riols and 
revolutions. I just try lo 
spark things, so the Harvard 
people can move in with 
their SZOO suits and gel things 
done properly. 

Meanwhile, I'll stay in my 
windbreaker and cap, and 
try lo give a marquee to the 
people who have no 
springboard for exposure, 
that have no sounding board. 
I may use the wrong words 
sometimes, but they're 
always in the direction of 
what's good for basketball 
and for (he kids. 

So peace, enjoy. We'll see 
you in the fall when the 
leaves start to turn.

"The Women" directed by 
Larry Life is the final PIT 
praduclion of the season and

Performances continue for 
Ihree weekends: April 11. 16,

This production of Clare 
Booihe Luce's 1936 comedy 
incorporates the music of 
Cole Porter, bringing 
familiar tunes such as 
■■Night and Day," "Ca, C'est 
L'Amour." and "Don't 



Fence Me In " to the PITs 
stage. Life said i( is 
especially appropriate to use 
Porter's music in Luce's 
play because "they traveled 
in the same literary and 
social set. They both wTote 
about (he lives of Ihe well-to- 
do of the period ... I always 
felt it a real pity that they 
never collaborated. So 1 
'collaborated' them." 

One bit of trivia Life un- 
covered while researching 
the play was that Clare 
Boothe met — and was 
proposed to by — Time Inc 
publishing mogul Henry R. 
Luce at a birthday party 
given tor Cole Porter by 
society hostess Elsa Max- 
well. 



Luce, in addition to 
playwriting. had established 
careers as a politician and 
diplomat. Her comedy ex- 
plores class divisions, 
women's faiihfu) and not -so- 
faithful relationships with 
men, and how these 
relationships are fractured 
and reflected in womens' 
friendships. 

In a moment that scan- 
dalized Broadway when Die 
play was first produced. 
Crystal, swathed in bubbles, 
plays an entire scene in the 
second act from a bathtub,

Review 



By ILENE SMITH 
SlaffWriter 

A funny thing happened 
recently. I was out with a 
friend having a nice 
romantic meal, when out of 
the blue he said to me "You 
know, you would be just 
perfect if you were a little 
more of a jock You look 
good, but you could still use 
some work!" 

"What would you 
suggest?" I asked, smiling 
pleasantly . 

"Why don't you lake up 
iogging'' " he suggested. 
This was a natural -enoughi., 
reply, considering it came 
from a devout born-again 
marathon runner. 

"Well, for one thing. " I 
replied, "gelling the dry 
heaves jusi doesn't impress 
me," As a result of that 
remark. I found myself in 
the midst of a long 
discussion about the many 
physical and psychological 
benefits of running. 

Something he said must 
have sunk m, though. The 
next day t was putting on 



those old track shoes that I 
had worn back in high 
school, and running around 
my neighborhood. 

Something was amiss 
though. My friend noticed il 
the next time he saw me. I 
guess it was something in the 
way I limped. 

"New shoes might do the 
(rick," he said. Looking 
down at my feel, I noticed a 
small hole in the left 
sneaker Maytjehewasonto 
something. "Take these for 
example. Foam cushioned 
on the inside, two layers of 
rubbeninthes9les,ano.skid . 
textured bottom, plus a 
specially designed cushioned 



rubber o 

arerunnt 

"They 



the inslep. These 
'sshoes."hesaid, 
certainly look 
good! "I said. 

"They should for 65 
bucks," he replied, 
somewhat under his breath. 
"Just one question." I 
said, "Where do Ihe bat- 
teries go' " He was amused. 
Having been set on the 
right track, so to speak, I 
decided, later that week, to 



buy new running shoes. I 
searched high and low, 
hunting throu^ miles of 
leather and canvas tennies. 
Finally, I found the perfect 
pair ~ shoes that were at- 
tractive, well engineered, 
and most importantly, 
cheap! There was just one 
slight problem, though, 

"Do they come in anything 
other than pastels?" I asked 
Ihe salesman hopefully. 

"No, not for women," he 
replied, "But if you run 
outside a lot, I'm sure you 
could kick up enough dirt. to 
hide thai baby blue," 

"I'll take them!" I said, A( 
last. 1 was ready to "run 
with the winners." 

My enthusiasm for jogging 
soon waned. My new 
sneakers disappeared to tlie 
back of my closet within two 
weeks. As for my friend, he 
all but disappeared loo. 



■The Joshua Tree' is U2's 
mosi varied and subtle 
album; not geared toward 
commercial radio at all. It 
contains no sure-fire smash 
hits, yet all the songs are 
great, and anyone of them 
I'm sure would get favorable 
responses over the airwaves. 

The album lives up to its 
namesake, "The Joshua 
Tree" because of its musical 
toughness and strong 
spirituality. The title fits a 
record that is concerned 
with social and political 
desolation; a record steeped 
in religious imagery Ever^'

This really surprised me. 
It seems like all the big 
names from Ihe Seventies 
are trying lo make a 
comeback these days, but 
Gregg Allman? 

Surprisingly, the music is 
good Allman is domg what 
he has always done: 
southern blues songs about 
sorrow and dejection. 
Allman wrote all hut two of 
Ihe songs, and these are the 
only two bummers on the 
album. "Evidence of Love" 
is a duet whiten with Don 
Johnson, a sure-fire failure 
from a sure-fire loser. 

Side two is much better 
than side one, and it ends 
with two songs, f^h^t. began 
the Allman Brothers first

"Don't Want You No More" 
and "It's Not My Cross To

commentary on Gregg's 
surviving his career — and a 
lament on the death of his 
brother Duane.
