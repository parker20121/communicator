^Dental 

From Page 1 



8:00 a.m. - Arrive at the 
clinic. I briedy think 
about leaving because I 
absolutely hate going to 
the dentist. It's creepy. 
Instead of running off, 1 
decide it's best to just sit 
and wait, 1 occupy my- 
self by looking around 
the waiting room at the 
otlier people, who look 
just as nervous as I am. I 
laugh to myself and think 
I'm not the only nervous 
one. 

8:05 a,m. - A dental hy- 
giene student named 
Kay calls me back. I fol- 
low her through the first 
room and then across the 
hall into a second, which 
is where 

I'll be for my prophylaxis 
(dental cleaning). 

8;10 a.m. - The initial vi- 
sual examination begins. 
The dental hygiene stu- 
dent looks around in the 
patient's mouth, check- 



ing for any lesions or 
any other telltale signs of 
mouth cancer 

8:25 a.m. • Now onto the 
periodontal screening. 
Kay uses a tool that has 
measurement lines lo 
detect how much space 
there is between 
my gums and teeth. At 
this point, I'm thinking 
it'snot that bad. 

8:50 a.m. - More inspec- 
tion for tooth decay and 
cavities. When I ask Kay 
the difference bet^veen 
plaque and tartar, she 
gives me a thoroughly 
scientific answer, i'm 
impressed. This part of 
the exam also checks my 
lymph nodes and neck, 
which is something my 
regular dentist visits have 
never included. 

9:15 a.m. - The actual 
dealing part of the exam 
begins. First, f^y applies 



a red colored plaque de- 
lector to my teeth, which 
shows me how well I'm 
brushing. Ifthere'splaque 
build-up, the red will pile 
up in those spots as an in- 
dicator. This application 
leads Kay to ask if I floss 
regularly. Without my an- 
swer, she can tell I don't 
every time I brush. Al- 
though she compliments 
me on the smoothness of 
my teeth, indicating I've 
been brushing the front 
of them well, she says 1 
need to begin flossing 
regularly. 

9:45 a-m. • The cleaning 
continues. My leeth are 
polished and scrubbed 
within an inch of their 
lives. The thoroughness 
of the cleaning is surely 
underestimated. 

10:10 a.m. - The cleaning 
is done and the teacher 
is called over to check 
Kay's work. While 1 think 



she did a fabulous job, 
the teacher finds a little 
bit of plaque left to be 
removed, so Kay tries 
again. She's really persis- 
tent and extremely nice, 
even when she had to go 
over my teeth again. 

10:20 a,m, - The teacher 
approves this time and 
sends me on my way with 
sparkling white teeth. It 
didn't take four hours as 1 
was expecting, which was 
a nice surprise. Although 
a cleaning at my regular 
dentist would've taken 
thirty or forty minutes, 
I'm amazed at the thor- 
oughness of the IPFW 
exam. It was well worth 
the two and a half hours. 
An appointment is re- 
quired. Call 260-481 -6575 
for more rates, schedul- 
ing, and more informa- 
tion.

Using your time away from campus 




Winter break is al- 
most here and like most 
other students I am 
excited to have a few 
weeks to relax and take 
my mind off of classes 
for a little while. Wheth- 
er your plans include 



I of Ii 



, ex- 



cessively lying around 
the house, doing some 
shopping or anything, 
else it is important to 



remember that the time 
away from campus truly 
should be used to rest, 
relax, and get in the right 

mindset for the spring se- 
mester. 

We have all been busy 
with work, school, family, 
social lives, and numer- 
ous other things that can 
quickly eat up our time. 
These last few weeks es- 
pecially can seem over- 



whelming with finals 
coming up and papers 
due. The break can be 
used to gather your 
thoughts and put some 
time into activities that 
are enjoyable, but may 
not easily fit into the hec- 
tic schedule of the regu- 
lar semester. 

1 will still be on cam- 
pus doing my part for 
student goverrunent over 



the break, but I plan on 
using the extra time away 
from classes to hang out 
with family and friends. 
1 also plan on making 
up for the several hours 
of sleep 1 missed out on 
during the semester. My 
biggest goal, however, is 
to avoid thinking about 
spring classes until ab- 
solutely necessary. Ev- 
eryone needs a healthy 



vacation from academia 
every so often. 

1 hope everyone has 
a wonderful and relax- 
ing break. And if you 
celebrate any of the up- 
coming holidays I hope 
they are filled with warm, 
fuzzy feelings and lots of 
delicious food. 



President Elect transitions with cabinet choices 



By Jason Smathers 

U-Vti'i SI Dry 



Another week, an- 
other round of profes- 
sors off to the White 
House. Obama's transi- 
tion team has welcomed 
aboard a number of aca- 
demics. Some will have 
more integral roles: a few 
Princeton alums will be 
serving as secretaries to 
the cabinet and White 
House staff, a few Har- 
vard professors ivill be 
helping advise on State 
Department appoint- 
ments and former Har- 
vard University President 



Larry Summers serxnng 
as economic advisor to 
President-elect Barack 
Ob am a. 

Other appointments 
are a little less than cru- 
cial — A Bulgers Uni- 
versity professor has 
been lapped for a co- 
chair for a review of the 
National Endowment 
of the Humanities and 
Arts. 

But while Obama 
starts to make his cabi- 
net picks, critics and 
analysts are still deal- 
ing with the transition 
in their own way. While 
Columbia University 
scientists noted a likely 
increase in stem cell 



research under Obama. 
they said it is unlikely 
there will he any medical 
breakthroughs as a result. 

Dr. lames Goldman of 
the Columbia University 
Medical Center said that 
most of the laboratories 
working on stem cell re- 
search are not collabo- 
rating as much as they 
could and that there has 
been "too much hype" in 
the field, making expecta- 
tions too high. 

Meanwhile, Iowa Uni- 
versity students were 
warned on Thursday from 
leftist writer Paul Street 
not to celebrate just yet 
over Obama's election. 
Street is wary of claims 



that the 44th president 
will make good on his 
promises to leave Iraq 
within 16 months. "In the 
absence of progressive 
pressure, the prognosis 
is not good," said Street, 
who found many in the 
audience agreeing with 
his assessment. 

But while many are 
engaged in an analysis of 
what's to come in Wash- 
ington DC, many more 
students are concerned 
with what's to come in 
California regarding 
Proposition 8, which 
defined marriage as a 
union between a man 
and a woman. 

Especially now that 



the California Supreme 
Court has granted a re- 
view of Proposition 8. 

Although the state's 
highest court says it will 
review the constitution- 
ality of proposition 8, it 
ivill not postpone it's im- 
plementation, meaning 
that gay marriages stiU 
cannot be carried out in 
the state. 

Campuses across the 
country have protested 
the California ballot 
initiadve — including 
Northwestern students 
and Evanston residents 
who protested a Cine- 
mark CEO who donated 
funds to the "Yes on 8" 
and Princeton students 



who rallied for a mock 
"Princeton Proposition 
8" regulating who can 
use the public sidewalks. 
Meanwhile, the Iowa 
State Daily featured a 
story on the only legally 
married gay couple in 
Iowa, who emphasized 
that the issue of marriage 
was one of equality. 

And while debate 
rages on in Washington 
and the rest of country 
regarding the country's 
finances, gay marriage 
and the direction of the 
country, at least Univer- 
sity of Michigan scien- 
tists are making minia- 
ture portraits of Barack 
Obama. 



Money re-routing necessary in season of federal spending 



By Maya Srikrishnan 

U.Wiie Op-Ed 



lis the season for 
buying each other 
cheap plastic gifts 

that will be swifdy 

relegated to the back 
of a closet — it's a 
Christmas tradition, after all. And all too often, we 
spend lax dollars the same way: just mindlessly 
throwing money around because, well, that's just 
the way it is and we never do anything about it. 

By all accounts, our economy's downward spi- 
ral continues. We lost more than a half-million jobs 
in November alone, and companies are cutting the 
hours of employees that hang on to their jobs. And. 
of course, those that lose their jobs also usually lose 
iheir health care, so we will probably be dealing 
with a huge increase in uninsured workers. 

All of this is very bad. Things will only get worse 
if the major auto companies collapse — that equals 
massive job losses that we probably can't sustain 
right now. However, it appears Congress is close to 
a band-aid to at least keep things afloat until the 
new administration takes over in lanuary. But the 
crisis also presents something of an opportunity: a 
chance to rethink how we spend our public money. 
It's no secret that we waste vast sums of mon- 
ey on pretty worthless programs. When times are 
good, we can overlook that waste fairly easily — but 
not now. We've got to focus on projects that produce 
teal value for the dollar, not just ones that help line 
someone's pockets. 

Let's start with the 'war on drugs. " That's an ex- 
cellent example ofa place where we need to imme- 
diately begin rethinking our approach. We're wast- 
ing money and getting nothing in return. 

"Defense spending," that nebulous category that 
represents everything from the Pentagon's budget 
to the cost of maintaining nuclear weapons to the 
money required to run Veteran's Affairs, is another 
opportunity to begin spending our money more 
intelligently. We spend nearly as much money on 
defense as the rest of the world combined — much 
of it on expensive experimental weapons projects 



that we don't need. If we're willing to take a hard, 
honest look at our defense budget, we could save 
huge amounts of money and put those fiinds to 
better use. 

On that front, the Obama ad ministration- in- 
waiting has been sending some positive signals 
over the past few weeks. Plenty of ink has been 
spilled about the president-elect's choices of 
Sen. Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. Gen. 
Jim Jones as national security adviser and Robert 
Gates to continue his role as secretary of defense. 
Most of the discussion has centered on whether 
Obama is backing down from an aggressively lib- 
eral foreign policy, or perhaps looking to unifj' 
those in opposition to neoconservative foreign 
policy. But we've generally overlooked Obama's 



"...Obama administration-in- 

waiting has been sending some 

positive signals over the past 

few weeks." 



intention to be^n cutting the military budget 
and how this new national security team fits that 
goal. 

The New York Times ran an article about a 
week ago focusing on how Jones, Gates and Clin- 
ton have all bought into Obama's goal to re-route 
mililar&gt;' spending to more useful areas. If true, 
having these three on Obama's side will proxnde 
him important political cover, enabling him to 
aggressively cut military spending, Jones is a for- 
mer NATO commander; Gates has served mul- 
tiple Republican presidents as defense secretary; 
Ciinton is part of the more hawkish wing of the 
Democratic Party. Having such a distinguished 
team backing a spending cut will make it much 
easier to more intelligently spend our tax dollars. 

But it's not going to be enough to just shift 
money around. The federal government is go- 



ing to have to increase spending to pull us out of our 
slump and the budget deficit is going to rise. Under 
these circumstances, that's not a bad thing: There's 
no other way around it. And on this front, too, Obama 
has been saying some encouraging things. 

In his most recent address to the nation, which 
is available on YouTube, Obama laid out his spend- 
ing priorities — and they are good ones, focused on 
projects that produce long-term value, not just a brief 
spending bump. 

Obama's plan focuses heavily on infrastructure in- 
vestment — what he calls the biggest program since 
the interstate highway system. Here in the Twin Cit- 
ies area, we know firsthand the problems caused by 
crumbling public infrastruciure. The new spending 
gives us the chance to simultaneously create jobs 
while giving us the roads, bridges and buildings we 
need to continue prospering in the decades ahead. 

We've got a good example of a worthwhile project 
right here on the University of Minnesota campus, 
with work set to begin on a replacement for the Sci- 
ence Classroom Building. The SCB needs to go — hav- 
ing class in the basement feels like listening to lecture 
in a coal mine. Construction of a new facility' there, 
with a better learning environment and more tech- 
nological integration, is exacdy the type of project we 
should be focusing on as we look for ways to spend 
stimulus money. 

Bui the federal government Is going to have to give 
individual states a hand to make this work. States can't 
deficit-spend, so as tax revenues fall, the state govern- 
ments need to make up for it by cutting spending. 
The federal government doesn't face such constraints, 
so ihcy will have to play the lead role in getting the 
spending started. We can focus on new schools, bet- 
ter roads, more public transportation, while creating 
jobs at the same time — we just need Washington lo 
commit. 

Unfortunately, we still have to wait another month 
and a half. Until the new Congress and administration 
take over, we're just going to be wasting recovery time, 
I'd like to think things can't gel any worse benveen 
tiien and now, but I could be wrong,

Nobel Son leaves too many holes 

By Kelly McLendon 



''NobelSon"shoiildbeginwithavvarnmg:Thisfilniis 
dense, complicated, and graphic. First, an unidentified 
man at an ATM machine gets knocked unconscious 
and the wannabe-killer cuts off the victim's tliumb with 
a butcher knife. Next, viewers have to watch one of the 
main characters, a 50-something Chemistry professor. 
Dr. Eli Michaelson, played by Alan Rickman, liaving an 
affair 
with one of his students in his office. 

After the crazy iniro, the movie does get better, but 
not much. Dr. Michaelson's son, Barkley, played by 
Bryan Greenberg, is a poor student trying to finish his 
PhD thesis, about cannibalism. Day after day he hangs 
out at the same coffee place and reuses the same foam 
cup, so he doesn't have to spend any money to buy a 
new one. One afternoon, he gets the message that his 
father has just won the Nobel Prize. Barkley views the 
award as no big deal, since his father is self-absorbed 
and pompous. 

Barkley is then rushed to an awards ceremony for 
his father at the university, but decides to leave early 
when Dr. Michaelson embarrasses him in front of his 
professors. He goes back to the caf^ and watches a 
poetr&gt;' reading. He's immediately attracted to one of 
the readers, a giri who goes by the stage name of "City 
Hall." Barkley introduces himself and tries his best to 
impress her. 

In each scene, a man can be seen watching Barkley 
in the background. This man is observing his every 
move and watching him closely He is planning and 
waiting. City Hall then takes Barkley to the ATM, where 
he proves that he is poor; showing a balance of $2.57 in 
his account. Knoiving he's not lying, she drives them 
both back to her house. 

As coincidence would have it, that evening is the 
night before the Michaelson family is supposed to 
leave for Sweden, lo accept the Nobel Prize. When 
Barkley wakes up in Citi' Hall's apartment, he is late for 
the fUght. He finds himself running down the street, 
hastily finding a cab and getting dropped off at home. 

Dr. Michaelson and his unfc, Sarah, a forensic 
psychologist, have already left for the airport, leaving 
Barkley to an empty house. He stumbles around the 
living room and suddenly, he's knocked unconscious. 

When he wakes up, he finds himself tied up in a 
dilapidated house, llie walls are dirty, the floor is 




dirtyandhiskidnapperlsacross the room, working on 
a car. Wlien he notices his victim has woken up, the 
kidnapper talks with him for a moment and threatens 
to remove Barkley's thumb, unless he calls his fadier 
and arranges the delivery of two million dollars. 

It seems Dr. Michaelson's research ideas may not 
be entirely his own. The kidnapper shows Barkley a 
chemistry notebook written by the person who should 
receive the real credit for the Nobel Prize and also, 
reveals a very important twist to his family tree. 

Overall, while the movie is good for a few laughs, 
it's densely complicated. Every scene something new 
happens and the end doesn't properly reveal the true 
plot. Too many of the characters seem oddly involved. 
Wait for "Nobel Son" to arrive at llie dollar theater 
before wasting your money on a relatively pointless 
film. 



Telling Tales through Graphic Design 

Former Fort Wayne Student Makes It Big, and Lives to Tell the Tale 



By Peter Schnellenberger 

SlaHWnltr 



Whoever said that Fort Wayne 
was worthless, obviously didn't 
know about all the great people 
diet this city has produced. People 
like the fashion designer Bill Blass, 
comicbookilluslrator Gray Morrow, 
professional football player lames 
Hardy, actress Jenna Fischer, and 
photojournalist brothers David and 
Pcterflirnley just to name a few. 

On TXjesday, Dec. 2 one 
important son of Fort Wayne 
relumed to the city of his rearing, 
computer animator and University 
of Saint Francis alumni, Adam 
Green, returned to his alma mater 
to tell the tale of his success. 

Adam worked for such firms 
as Lucas Arts, Blue Sky and even 
Disney. His name is credited to 
feature films like: Horton Hears a 
Hop, Bolt, and die upcoming Ice 
Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs. He 
has also done animation for the 
video games: Star Wars: The Force 
Unleashed and (the unpublished) 
Shrek the 3rd. 

To begin his presentation, 



Adam, gave a special shout out to 
his former art teacher. Don Goss, 
who first introduced him to graphic 
design, Mr. Goss has been leaching 
art classes (including computer 
animadon and photography) and 
designing theatre sets, at Elmhurst 
High School for about 50 years now. 
Goss has also taught photography 
to the likes of David and Peter 
Turnley 

Most of his presentation 
consisted of Adam talking about 
his various projects, and shoiving 
examples of his work at Disney, 
Blue Sky and the original character 
he designed, which got him his first 
big break. Which was getting hired 
on contract at Blue Sky (where he is 
now a staff member.) 

During the question &amp; answer 
portion, one aspiring graphic 
designer asked, what firms look for 
in budding animators. He replied, 
"Tlie best way to market one's work 
is lo have a good product." He went 
on to talk about howhaving a highly 
decorated jewel case and CD is a 
bad idea. The more work a designer 
puts into tlie CD case the less work 
they put into their product. 




Don Goss and Adam Green 

lohnLadd. Studio MCoordinator 
at IPFW, also attended Adam Green's 
lecture. When asked why Green's 
visit was relevant lo IPFW students 
he said, we have a computer art 
degree here at IPFW and some of 
the students want lo work in film 
and video games. He said diat it was 
good, for those who attended, to 
heat from an industry professional. 
lust so that they can get exposure 
and hear what advise an industry 
professional has to give. 

Ifllicre is one tiling thai students 
can learn from Adam Green's 
example, it's that if you love what 
you're doing, it doesn't matter who 
you are or where you come from, 
your dreams can come true.

Kanye West's new album lives up t( 



By Devin fVlidiJIeton 



Kanye West's808's&amp; Heartbreak 
is a solid album. Musically the 
production is some of the best he's 
ever done. Using an 808 machine, 
all of the beats sound like they're

blend of autotune and distortion 
effects to his voice. The album 
features high profile artist such 
as Young leezy and Lil Wayne, but 
also new comers such as Kid Cudi 
and Mr. Hudson. 

'Say You Will' is a good start 
to the album. If anyone's been 
in a relationship where ones 
expectations were completely un- 
met, this is probably the song for 
you. 'Welcome To Heartbreak' is 
the next track. I woidd've preferred 
this as die opener, but oh well, sdll 
good. Kanye basically speaks on 
missing out on the simpler things 
of life, and reveals Ihat although 
he got his dreams of super stardom 
fulfilled, he missed out on the besi 
things life has to offer. His recent 
prot^gfi' Kid Cudi appears on this 
song, adding vocals for the choms. 
'Heartless' is possibly the most hip 
hop influenced song and actually 
my least favorite. 

'Amazing' is one of the best 
songs on the album. The message 
of this song is lo not let die person 
that hurt you take away die best 
things about you. Young )eezy 
delivers a great verse al the end of 
the song.

'EYE OF THE TIGER': 



A quick guide to finals weelc 



By Craig Lloyd 

lecholive.blDgspDt.com 

With finals week quickly 
approaching, stress is floating around 
the IPFW campus, just like the pungent 
smell of the river and sewer water. 
Stress isn't a rarity and it's a huge part 
of the college experience. We don't, 
however, have to let it get the best of 
us. These tips will be sure to save your 
sanity during your last moments of the 
semester, 

• Bedtime Tunes 

Getting enough sleep is one of the 
steps 10 relieve stress and do well on 
exams. What better way to do so than 
to fall asleep to some easy listening. 
If your Oivn music library is lagging of 
such tunes, then head on over to wivw. 
bedtimetunes.trash-can.net to hear 
a collection of 
tracks that l^rill 
put you lo sleep 
faster dian Vick's 
NyQuil. 

" Have a Laugh 

A big stress reliever 
is laughing. Take a 
break from your stressful 
studying and have fun. 
Hang out with your friends for a 
bit. There are also a ton of websites 
that contain humorouscontent like 
You'hibe, eBaum's World. Homestar 
Runner and many more. 



• Find a Hobby 

We all have something that we like to 
do frequendy, whether it's exercising, 
playingvideo games, listening to music, 
or knitting. We all have activities that 
keep us sane and reduce stress. 

• Eliminate Procrastination 
Procrastination is one of the biggest 

stress builders, especially for college 
students. If you need to get something 
done, do it today; if you need to do 
something today, do it now. Don't 
say you'll do it tomorrow because 
tomorrow never comes, 

• "Eye of the Tiger" 

If Survivor's pump-up song "Eye 
of the Tiger' doesn't raise your self- 
esteem, 1 don't know what will. Listen to 
this tune right before a stressful exam. 
Strap on those boxing gloves and show 
that final exam who is boss. 




album lives up to lofty expectations 



ong released from the album; 
veryone should know this song by 
Dw. Its basically about wanting to 
)ve someone, but not being able 
3 because your not \'^ling to let 
ourself be vulneiable, ending up 
10 re alone. 

'Paranoid' is about your 
artner being paranoid and 
worrying about things they don't 
eed to worry about. This song 
as a real cool 80's pop vibe to it 
lial you have to love. Another 
ne of Kanye's recKnt discoveries, 
1r. Hudson, shines on this song, 
jd Cudi actually provided back 
ip vocals but is uncredited. 
ilobocop' is my favorite song off 
lie album and an instant classic 
[1 my opinion. It follows the same 
oncept as the last song, but this 
ime with a more creative theme. 
"he production really shines here 
flih classic \ioiin provided by 
■lerbie Hancock. 'Streetlights' is 
mother favorite, a real abstract 
ype of song. The song can have 
1 different personal meaning 
Icpending on who's listening, 
tdoes make you reflect on life and 
tuts you in the zone. 

'Bad News' is a song about a 
lerson you care about the most 
:oming out of nowhere and 
jreaking your heart. A good song, 
)ul lacks the energy Uiat the 
jrevious songs had, 'See You In 
vly Nightmares' is everything that 
IQU wanted to say lo the one who 
nokc your bean. Lil Wayne is on 
his song and surprisingly adds 
1 lot to it to make it as good as i[ 



is. 'Coldest Winter' is a very sad 
song. Kanye says that this one is 
about his mom's passing. You can 
definitely feel the emotion in this 
song antl is one of the high points 
in the album, closing it out on a 
powerful note. 

All in all, every track has 
something to offer to the listener. 
His other albums haven't really 
offered a look into his love life. The 
sound of the album is also one that 
could be called genre-less, Kanye 
West has alwaysendedupchanging 
the sound of Hip Hop music witli 
his production, whether it be soul 
sampling, utilizing the power of 
an orchestra and live band, or 
blending hip hop with European 
electro music. This time around, 
his goal isn't to change anything 
about music, he wants to change 
the way people perceive music. 
Being the star that he is, he has a 
lot of influence with hip hop fans. 
My guess is, that after this album, 
pure hip hop fans will give other 
:hance.

Opportunity Ambassdon offers unique benefits 

A brief on representing IPFW, worl&lt;ing witli CInancellor and community 



By Abigail Kopen 



TheAmbassadonsisa 
committee at IPFW that 
serves as a host of sorts 
to the chancellor and 
also commits to a nimi- 



ber of responsibilities. 
Each month, Ambassa- 
dons work a number of 
major events on campus 
and elsewhere. 

When on the job, Am- 
bassadon's are to wear 
formal clothing and get 
to choose ahead of time 
which events they would 



like to be a part of. Each 
semester they take part 
in a community service 
project and attend work- 
shops each month on 
leadership development. 
Ambassadons represent 
IPFW and have many 
exciting opportunities 
and networking chanc- 



es. Some of the rewards 
of being an Ambassa- 
don are networking with 
many important people 
here in the Fort Wayne 
community, working 
closely with the chancel- 
lor by working receptions 
at his home as well as 
occasionally getting the 



opportunity to travel to 
board meetings in West 
Lafayette via private jet 
and the benefits of hav- 
ing the Ambassadon's 
committee on a resume. 
In order to become 
an Ambassadon one is 
required to have at least 
a 2.5 GPA. Recruitment 



begins next semester, 
spring 2009. Starting in 
January the Communi- 
cator will profile a new 
Am basssadon each wee k,

Cookies: the Perfect 
Way to Wind Down 



By Louisa Danielson 



What's one way to 
relax while making the 
house smell like a cross 
betivecn Rustic Hutch 
and the Aimoiid Garten? 
Bake cookies! There's 
just something about a 
warm kitchen and that 
rich, crumbly scent thai 
permeates the house and 
warms people right up. 
Maybe it's because they 
like to hang around the 
oven door, turning on the 
light and checking' the 
pans inside; or maybe its 
just fun to make some- 
thing a little bit special. 

Whatever the cause, 
cookies are both a fun 
and delicious way to re- 
lax. With that in mind, 
here is a good recipe for 
Variable Cookies: 

1 1/2 cups Hour 

1/2 cup butter (can 
use a half and half blend 
of butter and margarine) 
— aCiWii-'.- 1 cup brown sugar 

legg 

1/2 teaspoon vanilla 
extract 

1/2 teaspoon baking 
soda 

1 teaspoon baking 
powder 



Dash of salt 

Peanut Butter chips 
(can substitute carob 
chips, butterscotch 

chips, orcandy sprinkles. 
Or combine any or all of 
the above for a unique 
cookie.) 

1. Preheat oven to 350 
degrees Fahrenheit. Soft- 
en the butter until it is 
half melted. Heat butter 
in either a metal dish in 
the oven as it preheats, or 
nuke the butter in a glass 
bowl in the microwave 
for 30 seconds. 

2. Add brown sugar to 
butter and blend until a 
soft paste forms. Add the 
egg, vanilla, baking soda, 
baking powder and salt. 
Stir until the mixture is 
smoodi. Then add the 
flour. Mix thoroughly, 
until dough forms a sol- 
id, squish-able ball. 

3. Fill your palm with 
peanut butter chips - it 
should be about 1/3 of 
a cups' worth. Carefully 
sprinkle the chips over 
the dough and knead 
them togedier. Add a 
second palms' worth of 
chips and knead again. 

4. Spray one jelly roll 
pan with Pam nonstick 
cooking spray. Care- 
fully pinch off chunks of 
cookie dough and roll 
them into balls, as you 



would shape modeling 
clay. Cookie balls should 
be about the size of un- 
s helled walnuts. 

5. Place balls on jelly 
roll pan. The easiest way 
to space them is to only 
put twelve cookies on 
a sheet - four lines of 
three balls each. Flatten 
each ball with your palm. 
Each cookie should be 
about 2 1/2 inches across. 
Don't press them too thin 
- you shouldn't be able to 
see the pan through the 
cookie. 

6. Bake for eight to 12 
minutes. Check as cook- 
ies bake, and pull them 
out of the oven when the 
tops of the cookies no 
longer look 'raw'. 

7. Let cool for about 
ten minutes, then enjoy. 
This should make about 
two dozen cookies. 

8. For variation, you 
can spread the dough out 
on the pan into one giant 
cookie and bake it a litde 
longer - about 15 min- 
utes. Special note: if you 
make the giant cookie, be 
sure la spread the dough, 
to an even thickness with 
a spatula or your hands 
before baking. Slice the 
giant cookie into bars 
with a pizza cutter after 
the pan is out of the oven 
hut before it has cooled.

IPFW loses twice in Summit 

■ Men open conference play on the road with losses at Southern Utah, UMKC 



UMKC senior forward Dane 
Brumagin tossed in a game-liigh

10 minutes, to lop the Mastodons 
70-62 on Saturday night at the 
MunicipaJ Auditorium. 

After fajiing behind by 10 points 
earlyinthesecond half, IPFW went 
on 18-Q run over an eight minute 
span to draw even at 45-atl. 

Forwards David Carson and 
Deilvez Yearby sparked the 
run. Carson had seven points 
during the streak, while Yearby 
blocked tivo shots, grabbed a 
couple of boards and stuck a 
put back. Junior guard Nick 
Daniels finished off the run 
with a three from the top of the 
key 

Butjust that quickly Brumagin — 
took over. He got it started by 
getting to the line and hitting four 
foul shots. He slashed to the hoop 
for a layin, and gave UMKC its 
biggest lead of the ball game with 
a 3-pointer. The 12-poini, 60-48 
margin was too much for the 'Dons 
to overcome and they eventually 
fell by eight. 

Carson led the Mastodons in 
scoring with 13 points. He was a 
rebound shy of a double-double 
ivith nine. 

Freshman guard Jeremy Mixon 



was the only other Mastodon in 
double figures, recording a career- 
high 10. Deilvez Yearby finished

seven teams. The d rop to six allows eve r^' 
team to go to the MIVA tournament, 
btit makes the competition for seeding 
that much more intense. 

Ball State will be the favorite in the 
conference after Ohio State lost three 
crucial multiple-year starters, while 
Lewis is following the charge and may 
make a play for the tide. Lewis is jusi 
in their third year of re-eligibility after 
NCAA violations. 

The sanctioning after the violations 
may have helped the program as the 
majority of their players have started 
For three and four years. 

IPFW, after two straight second place 
regular season tinishes and MIVA 
tournament titles, dropped to fifth last 
year and with such a new team, will 
have to fight to finish better this time. 

To try and facilitate botii the tough 
conference and the young program, 
Ball said he worked very hard to gel this 
year's schedule how it is. Included in 
the schedule are 16 honle matches to 
just lOon the road. The team will bring 
in Pacific and first year program Grand 
Canyon, among others. 

It will also be a benefit to the changed 
program that the team has already 
grown close. 

"The team in my opinion is just as 
close any that we have had since 1 
have been here. We enjoy each others 
company and spend a lot of time 
together outside of the court," Stewart 
said. 

"The upperclassmen are very 
supportive of us younger guys and help 
us out whenever Ihey can," Peterson, 
one the freshmen, added.

OUTSIDE: Freshman Ef ic Hardek 
(3) is one of many competing for 
playing time at outside hitter. 

But for now, everything is just 
speculation. The team doesn't open 
official practice until January 4, just five 
days before their opening match. Still, 
all of these things considered, Arnie 
Ball still has the same goal as always. 

Afterall, the 2006 trip to the Final 
Four helps him still remembers what 
overachieving in the eyes of others in 
the volleyball community is like. 

"You never know where a team starts 
and where it may end." Ball said. 
"Considering what we've done in the 
program, the goal for the team is to win 
a national title." 



With a vastly different lineup for 2009, every position is, 
has been or will be up for grabs between teammates 



By Dan Vance 

spam Editor 

"Young, young and younger.." 

Coach Amic Ball cannot describe 
his 2009 team in any clearer way. 

But a young team means that many 
holes are wide open in every position, 
making the inner-squad competiton 
that much more intense. 

At the hitter positions, the freshmen 
are expected to be major contributors 
right away, especially in the form of 
Phi! Peterson and redshin freshman 
J I Meyer, 

But in the recent form of Matt 
Zbyszewski and C| Mac i as, one hitter 
has to step up to lead in major ways 
and in Ball's eyes there is just one 
person to do that. 

"Daryl Shank is going to have to pick 
up the slack a bunch. The stud guy 
has to be Daryl Shank." 

Shank played in just 48 games in 21 
matches as a freshman with 39 total 
kills and 41 digs. In the three-match 
fallhomeexhibition.heknockeddovvn 
12 kills in a 3-1 win over Quincy. 

"The competition for the hitter 
spots has been very intense all fall. I 
expected this coming in due to the fact 
we're a young group and everyones 
playing for a starting spot," Peterson 
said. "The intensity everyone plays 
with raises the level of play. " 

At setter, junior Corey Stewart, 



senior Kevin Goncalves and highly 
touted freshman Dan Mader will 
compete for playing time. 

"The spot will eventually go to the 
setter who has the best chemistry with 
the other starters and ultimately can 
manufacture \vins," Stewart said. 

The setter position is one of the 
most important positions from a 
leadership standpoint in the game of 
volleyball." Stewart added. "At IPFW 
this is magnified because of the long 
stading tradition of great setters the 
program has had, most notably Lloy 
Ball," 

"Its pretty intense, which is a 
good thing," Ball noted about the 
competition at the setter position. 

The other major battle is at libero, 
where senior Mike Morici and junior 
Man Pliske have each led IPFW to 
the Final Four in their time with the 
program. Coach Ball also noted that a 
third libero could be moving in. 

"That's a tough one, we may have the 
tliree best liberos in the conference. 
Mikey is better in the backcourl and 
Man is the stronger passer, so we will 
just wait and see," Ball said. 

Averaging2.46digspergamein2008, 
Pliske is die second returning MIVA 
leader behind Lewis' Nick Perakes. 

"From our exhibition season in 
the fall I was encouraged by how 
competitive it is at each position," 
Stewart noted.

Two years removed from the National Title game, a rebuild is 
underway for coach Arnie Ball and his new look Army 



By Dan Vance 

5 ports Editor 

Three seasons can change everything 
in the world. Arnie Ball is ail too aware 
of that. 

In that time, he has seen his Mastodon 
volleyball program, with relatively the 
same roster, go from overachievers to 
national contenders to un detach levers. 
And now here he and they are- back to 
basics and hitting resian again. 

When the 2009 season begins against 
visiting Puerto Rico-San luan on 
January' 9, it will be with just seven 
players who have seen the court in 
an IPFW uniform, five true freshmen 
and a smorgasboard of fresh, untested 
talent. 

"My personal goal is to not lose the 
little hair I have -■ ■ ■ ■■■ 

left," Ball joked |iHjl|i|mi'mjlV 
of the impending 
rebuilding season. 

Hitting 
means a number 
of things, including 
leadership. After 
graduating seven "" 

players last spring, the program has just 
three seniors and orJy one of whom, 
Mike Morici, has played significant 
minutes in the past. 





"Leadership is important from 
everyone and not just me. I might have 
be here the longest but everyone plays 
their part in order lo make the team 
better," Morici noled. 

"That facetof a team sport isimportant 
every year. I'm not sure where we'll find 
it, but hopefully we do before we go to 
far into the season," Ball added. 

The team also has to restart hard at 
hitler positions, where they lost four 
mainstays to last spring's exodus of 
seven seniors. Five of those seniors 
were either outside, middle or opposite 
hitters. 

Enter those true freshman, three 
of whom take up hitter spots on the 
outside with Phil Peterson, Eric Hardek 
and Ivan Matos. The other main hitter 
will be sophomore Daryl Shank who 
saw limited court time last season, 

■ Sophomore Oliver 

'Hin iR^ftnWtJi Kook will return to 
clog up the middle. 
Freshman Corey 
Frain will also hit out 
of the middle. 

Even with a wide 
array of new faces 
to fill up the spots 
on the court, it will still be a rebuilding 
year in many ways for a Mastodon 
program that has not been used to 
being overlooked lately.

The Midwestern Intercolligtete 

Volleyball Association will be stacked 
this season, even with the loss of 
another program. Metcyhurst, the 
conference's perennial last place team, 
discontinued their program; leaving 
the MIVA with just sL\ teams. 

The conference had expanded to 1 1 
teams from 2005-2007, but cancelled 
their divisional aUignment before the 
200B season, leaving them with just 



"Unlike past years we will definitely 
be off the radar at the beginning of the 
season and be an underdog in almost 
every match we play this season," said 
junior Corey Stewart. "If we embrace 
the role of the underdog and play our 
best one match at a time, good things 
will happen." 

Stewart is another of the more 
experienced players in the Mastodon 
lineup, in his foiuth year after 
redshjrting as a freshman.
