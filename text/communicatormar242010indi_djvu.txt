IPFW Parking: A Shark Hunt 

OpEd 



By Kristan Mensch 

k ri 1 1 a n bi raniwO gnu il com 



I recently stumbled across a 
group on Facehook entitled "The 
amazing moment when you 
finally find a parking space at 
IPFW." 

Of course, I checked it out, 
giggled for a bit, and then went 
on my merry way. Yet, ideas were 
forming in my head ... ideas 
involving non-IPFW parking 
spaces. 

As I once described, IPFW is 
a shark hunt when it comes to 
parking. People go every-which- 
way in order to snag every last 
spot - and that is exactly the 
lesson for today. 

Coming home from IPFW the 
other day, I needed to stop at the 
gas station. While gas stations 
aren't known for their distant 
parking spots. I was still angry just 
because I knew I'd have to stop 
and get out of the car to use my 
legs even more, after the weight of 
a backpack had worn them down 
throughout the morning. 

Not to worry, though, I pulled 
straight up to the first parking 
spot, took no more than four steps 
and was in front of the counter. 
Success. 

Although everyone hates 



walking from out in the middle 
of nowhere to their most boring 
class to sit and listen to a lecture 
just to end up walking all the way 
back, it forces us to appreciate the 
"little spaces." 

For instance, when we 
scrounge for a place to stop our 
cars all day at school, we surely 
do not want to run errands on 
the way home. Upon arrival at the 
bank, grocery, pharmacy or what- 
have-you, we get exceptionally 
close parking spots. The glory! 

There is no such thing as an 
experienced IPFW parker who 



will not sit and think "wow, front 
row." and bask in the excellence 
before stepping out. 

The all too experienced IPFW 
parker would also probably 
hang around said bank, grocery, 
pharmacy or what-have-you to 
accomplish un-needed tasks just 
to hold on to that spot for a little 
while longer, as well. 

So get into the game - scrounge 
for the spots, get angry, get sad ■ 
just make sure you give yourself a 
moment to sigh and pat yourself 
on the back when you really catch 
a good one.

From Page 1 

One disadvantage to that is IPFW's campus also 
being very close in range to nightlife favorites for 
of-age college students, including Pierre's, known 
as the "Midwest's largest night club," and Snicker/ 
comedy club. 

Because of that, Canterbury is also where a lot 
of younger people who like to drink and party end 
up living. While that is not necessarily a bad thing. 
it rums into one very quickly when crimes are 
committed - often due to alcohol consumption. 
Unfortunately, Canterbury residents are not 
unfamiliar with those sorts of events. 

In September 2009, Amanda McLaughlin, an 
IPFW student, fell victim to a hit-and-run after 
stumbling off of a median in Canterbury. 

According to a News-Sentinel article on 
November 18, 2009, "Northgate and Canterbury 
boulevards, which cut through the sprawling 
Canterbury Green apartment complex, now boast 
six new caution signs that warn drivers of curves 
ahead and urge lower speeds." 

They continued to state that an allegedly drunk 
driver had ran over a curb and crashed into the 
Canterbury business office just days before. 

McLaughlin's friends and family have created 
a Facebook group who's members are actively 
protesting the speed limits in Canterbury and 
asking forspeed bumps to be placed along multiple 
roads. 

Sadly, during all of these efforts from area 
people, Canterbury was the location for yet another 
death March 11. 

Wade A. Reader was shot to death after a fight 
brake out at a local bar. 

According to a News-Sentinel article dated 
March 11, "It is believed the Pufhal-Reader feud 
reached a boiling point at a northeast-side bar 
earlier in the evening, where an altercation resulted 
in the two being kicked out. Allegedly, the two then 
agreed to meet at an arranged spot in the apartment 
complex, where the argument reignjted and shots 
were fired." 

IPFW junior Kalie Amber said "Me and all my 
friends who live there (Canterbury! are planning on 
moving out," adding that it was "not just because 
of all of that [the shooting], but because of all the 
things happening there. It's just really going down 
hill - it seems it's not very safe anymore." 

As it seems, many other residents also feel 
unsafe in their own apartments. According to 
apartmenuatings.com. Canterbury only receives a 
2.9 safety rating on a scale to five. 

Nevertheless, these tragic events have unfolded 
close to home for many IPFW students. For many 
more, they have occurred too close.

The rundown on what is happening on campus and in the world ■ this week 



Walk to "Take Back the Night" 

The community will come together 
again to support an end (o violence 
against women in the "Take Back the 
Night" event on Thursday, March 
25 from 7:30 to 9 p.m. The half-mile 
walk will begin at Cole Commons. 
Participants at the event will receive 
pizza and a free t-shirt once the 
program closes. 
Campus Police are Bicycle Friendly 

The IPFW Police Department's bike 
patrol uni! is made up of 10 officers. 
"Officers can perform nearly all of their 
duties on bicycles, with the exception 
of transporting prisoners," according to 
the 2009/2010 Annual Security Report. 

The Department also registers 
bicycles for students in case of theft. 
Take your bike to Student Housing, or 
the Police Station, located behind the 
Science Building, to be registered. 
Scavenger hunt includes a cow, donuts 
and Facebook 

IPFW students are encouraged 
to participate in Citilink's "The 
campusLink Experience," March 
29 through April 1. The event is a 



scavengerhunt with prizes. "Giveaways 
include Ivy Tech, IPFW, and Citilink 
apparel and promotional items, as well 
as several gift cards to area businesses, 
bookstores, and restaurants,'' according 
to the news release. 

The rules of the game are simple: 
each day students will have a task to 
complete, which includes taking video 
or pictures at specified locations and 
then posting it to the campusLink 
Facebook page.

fwcilil ink.com. 
Google on the screen 

Google TV is the "next big thing" the 
company plans to add. Google, Intel 
and Sony are working on the project, 
which will be, "a platform and service 
that will funnel search, video. Twitter 
and other web applications through 
set-top boxes and onto televisions," 
according to the Ghana Broadcasting 
Association. A release date has not 
been set. 
Bluefin goes unrestricted 

Japan, a consumer of 75 percent 
of the world's stock of bluefin tuna is 



relieved to know that the fish ban re- 
quested by the Conventional on Inter- 
national Trade in Endangered Species 
(CITES) in Qatar failed to go through. 
CITES is responsible for restricting 
such things as the trade of elephant 
tusks. In an article from The Washing- 
ton Post, the organization's spokesman 
said the ban was not enacted because 
the tuna is commercially important. 



iPad stronger than iPhone 

In the minds of customers, the IPad 
carries more weight than the iPhone. 
The tablet's sales are expected to beat 
the first 3-month sales of the iPhone. 
"Apple sold 1 .2 million original iPhones 
back in 2007 when it launched the 
handset, and the WSJ report says the 
iPad could outperform this number if 
demand keeps steady," PCWortd said.

'Gamers" not who you think they are 



Hearing the word gamer means 
different things to different people. 
To some it is a hobby or a word some 
people use but doesn't mean much, 
while to others it can mean a lifestyle 
that may or may not require a lot of 
time and money devoted to it. 

In general, to non gamers, there is 
a slight stigma to the word denoting it 
as something negative, time-wasting, 
geekyor not normal. When most people 
hear the word gamer they usually think 
of the most popular games of the time 
such as the massive multi player online 
role playing game: World of Warcraft 
or the Call of duty series with its new 
release, Modem Warfare II. 

The term conjures up the image 
of some shut In kid in his mom's 
basement yelling at the computer or 
TV with empty Doritos bags along with 
half empty mountain dew cans lying 
all over the floor. While this image may 
have been popularized by the TV show 
South Park it doesn't mean all gamers 
are like that. 

Playing video games is just like 
reading books or taking up a sport like 
snowboarding, they are all activities 
people choose to do in their spare 
time and choose how involved they 
want to be with that activity. Take 
snowboarding for example. Let's say 
you get invited to go with some friends. 
You go to some local place and try 
it out, fall a few times, but generally 
get the hang of it. Now that you find 
out you tike snowboarding you can 
go in many different directions. You 
could snowboard for fun every once in 
awhile with your friends, or you could 
decide that snowboard in g= life and 



spend gratuitous amounts of money 
on gear and lessons then head out into 
the white snowy yonder to find your 
destiny snowboarding every day for 
the rest of your life. The same is true for 
gamers. 

. No matter what the type of 
game, gamers fall into one of many 
unofficially defined categories. Since 
gaming covers many aspects such as 
counsel and computer and since there 
is no official gaming ruling council, 
most terms are player made and by 
constant usage come to be more or less 
accepted. 

Here are a few gamer stereotypes. 
There is the social gamer who only 
really games when others game. There 
is the old school gamer, someone 
who was into games as a kid and 
likes to remember the good old days. 
The last two categories are casual 
and then hardcore. You can go from 
being someone who owns a system 
and maybe a few games who plays 
from time to time to pass the time to 
someone who has a library of games 
has all the apparel and spends all 
their free time (and maybe even more 
outside of free time) gaming. Most of 
what someone is is self defined. 

Hearing the word gamer might 
conjure up some negative stereotypes 
but remember being a gamer doesn't 
mean only one thing. 

Like any other activity gaming is 
multi faceted with many diverse and 
unique followers. From playing a 
game here and there to being a paid 
professional gamer (yes, they do exist) 
the term gamer means many things. 
So next time you hear someone saying 
they are a gamer find out what kind 
and maybe join them for a game or two. 
Before you knowit you might become a 
gamer yourself, who knows what kind.

Smoke Hut Diaries 



By Robin Crowetl 

robrnyoDT grovf*J gmjJ I . torn 



Tt is fairly remarkable to me 
the difference that just a few 
days of nice weather can do for 
the overall morale on campus. 

I see people playing Frisbee 
in the grass, I see crowds amass 
at the Smoke Huts instead of 
bolting For the doors of the 
buildings, and I see girls that 
find it necessary to wear short 
shorts and tube tops in fifty 
degree weather. Spring is awe- 
some. 

It seems as though at the be- 
ginning of the semester it was 
difficult to get people to open 
up at the Huts, it seemed that 
the new faces were 'intruders' 
and wanted nothing to do with 
me, and it seemed that the days 
were way too long. In the two 
week since spring break has 



been over, there is an entirely 
different climate (no pun in- 
tended) associated with my 
smoke breaks. 

For one, there are a ton 
more people gathered around 
in the Huts. Sometimes this is 
a good thing, sometimes it isn't. 
If anything, it's more people to 
try to offend. Secondly every- 
body just seems far more jo- 
vial. There are still those people 
that still (and probably always 
will) refuse to crack a smile, 
and that's fine. I'll just smile on 
the inside while thinking about 
how miserable they are going to 
be for the rest of their lives. 

The one aspect of positiv- 
ity that doesn't come through, 
though, is the complaining. I 
am guilty of it, probably more 
so than others, and here is why. 

Not to complain more about 
the establishment of college 
in general, but it seems that as 



soon as spring break comes to 
a close that our professors have 
it ingrained in their brains that 
"oh, well, they just had a break, 
let's make the remainder of their 
semesters a living Hell." Since 
the weeks before break and 
the one, single week that we've 
been back,., my work load has 
close to doubled. Why is this? 
Logically it would seem that 
it's the latter half of the semes- 
ter and to draw it to a close, the 
pace needs to pick back up. But 
wouldn't that lend cause to bet- 
ter distribute the work toward 
the beginning of the semester? 
. Maybe I'm wrong in think- 
ing that it's doubled, simply be- 
cause the last thing that I want 
to do is be holed up in class- 
rooms burying my nose into 
books that 1 don't want to read 
and losing sleep over papers 
that I don't want to write. Seven 
more weeks, friends. Be strong.

Who needs traditional 
news when you have 
Twitter and Facebook? 

OpEd 

By Kelly McLendon 

mcIendcmJietlrAgnvill.com 



In light of a few events that have happened this 
week it is clear that Twitter and Facebook may report 
the news far sooner than other sources. Or at the very 
least, a jumbled version of it. The two social media 
sites have also been saving the lives of unhappy 
people. 

This week, it was reported that the life of an 18 
year old Florida man who suffered from obsessive 
compulsive disorder was saved because actresses 
NiaVardalos and Demi Moore saw the posting on his 
Twitter and reported it to authorities. The teenager 
wrote that he was planning to hang himself. Vardalos 
called the Sheriff's Office where the teenager lived in 
Casselbury, Florida. Deputies then went to the man's 
house and took him into protective custody. It could 
be said that Vardalos' call may have saved a life. 

Other lives have been saved from Twitter postings 
in nearly identical ways. 

Suicide Prevention News lists two examples of 
people posting how they were going to kill themselves 
and the people who followed their accounts have 
called the police. One story details how an Oxford, 
England, boy told a Maryland girl he was chatting 
with that he planned to take his life. The girl told 
her mother, who alerted local authorities, who then 
contacted Scotland Yard. 

If the girl would have found it to be a joke, maybe 
the plan would have been carried through and 
the Englishman wouldn't be alive today. The right 
channels of law were used and the boy was saved. 

In other cases, Facebook seemingly reports the 
news, or at least part of it. before other media outlets. 
Such was the case Saturday March 20, when there was 
a fire in Fort Wayne. Before it was on the 1 1 p.m. local 
news, there was a post on Facebook, with someone 
asking what happened on the road the fire was on 
and other people responded with the details they 
knew. Some media outlets also update current events 
on their Facebook before the story actually hits 
their website, letting selected readers know before 
everybody else. 

All in all, while social media sites may take up 
a great deal of time for people, they are useful for 
saving people's lives and for knowing what is going 
on nationally or locally before it is officially reported. 
Since more than 200 million people had Facebook 
accounts in 2009, it is clear that people are using the 
site to get informed ahead of everyone else.

With "It's Times like These" 
The Foo Fighters playing in the back- 
ground, my best friend and I set off for 
our one day adventure to Hammond, 
Indiana last Saturday. 

Hammond is not really that differ- 
ent from Fort Wayne, but you feel like 
you are in a dif- 
ferent state with "Hammond does contain one

can really judge something like that... 
not me, and I do love a good bag of 
gummi worms. 

Looking for something local, we 
tried dinner at a place called the Purple 
Steer. It was a lame version of Liberty 
Diner; I wouldn't make my dog, if I had 
one. eat those leftovers. When the wait- 
ress asked if my friend needed a boxand 
we refused, she asked "What about the 
kids in Africa?" When she returned with 
the box, I asked how I was supposed to 
get the food to the African kids, she had 
no answer. I must say, that joke was in 
poor taste for a restaurant. I definitely 
have a soft spot for suffering children, 
and now when I think Purple Steer all I 
picture is a bunch of starving children 
and a funny looking cow. Sigh. 

Some places you could check out 
definitely start with a tour of the candy 
factory, which is located on Lincoln 
Highway shortly before you reach Ham- 
mond. Hammond does contain one of 
the biggest inland marinas of its kind, 
with a beach called Whihala Beach, 
which is worth the

might find; just get yourself a GPS to 
get you home and go out and explore.

STUDENT? 




ARIES | Mar. 21- April 20) Don't settle for less than the 
best. Opportunities to expand your circle of friends will 
result in possible new romantic encounters. You will 
be prone to carelessness that could result in accidents: 
Professionalism will be of utmost importance. 

TAURUS lApr. 21- may 21) Don't ruffle the feathers 
of those you care about most. Don't allow your personal 
problems to interfere with your professionalism. You will 
earn recognition for the work you are doing. Don't be a pest 
or a troublemaker this week. 



GEMINI (May 22-Iune 21) You are best to work at 
home, clearing up overdue projects. Don't be angry, but be 
on your guard. You may be up for some changes in your 
home. Your tack of responsibility and attention has been a 
key issue in your relationship. 

CANCER ( lune 22-Inly 22) You will communicate easily 
and should be able to develop new friendships. Secret 
affairs will only lead to heartache. Your ideas may be good, 
but they aren't necessarily right for everyone. You will have 
a little more energy than usual. 

LEO (lulv 23-Aug 22) Someone you care about may not 
be too well. Mingle with those who can help you get ahead. 
Expressing yourself in novel ways should lead you down 
new avenues. Don't expect romantic encounters to be 
lasting. 

VIRGO . (Aug. 23 -Sept. 231 Don't confide in anyone 
for the time being. Anger might lead to carelessness and 
minor Injuries. You will have to make some changes 
regarding your direction if you wish to keep on top of your 
career expectations. You may attract attention if you get 
out socially. 

LIBRA (Sept. 24 -Oct. 23) Don't let any small 
misunderstandings get in the way. Focus on forming 
business partnerships. Keep calm. Someone around you is 
bouncing off the walls. Get involved in volunteer work that 
will bring you satisfaction, not an empty wallet. 

SCORPIQ (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22) You will have to be 
sure not to bum the candle at both ends. Go over their 
important documents and take the time to suggest 
alternatives. Be prepared to lose friends or alienate other 
people if you insist on being stub bom. Family outings that 
aren't expensive will be enjoyable and help strengthen ties. 

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 -Dec. 21) Acknowledge your 
lover's needs. You can enjoy doing things that include 
children. You may want to talk to your boss about your 
future goals. Don't get depressed, get busy. You can 
accomplish a lot if you're willing to put in a little extra time. 

CAPRICORN (Dec 22.- Jan. 20) Try to understand their 
point of view. Try not to at tempt to do something unless 
you are fully intent on following through with the plans. 
You can make changes to your home that will be pleasing 
to all concerned. Find out more, if you want to start your 
own business. 

AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 -Feb. 19) This is not the best 
time to take a risk, to gamble or spend money you really 
can't afford to part with. Problems with skin, bones, or 
teeth may mess up your schedule. You must use discretion 
when talking to others. Gambling should not be an option. 
Attend seminars that will bring you in contact with the 
right people. 

PISCES (Feb. 20-Mar. 20) Depression may result if you 
don't get to do things your own way. Go out with friends 
or family. Don't expect support from your mate. Romantic 
relationships should stabilize.

By the end of her senior year at IPFW, lillian Speece will 
have many impressive accomplishments under her belt. Not 
only will she have two degrees in her hand this May, but her 
band will likely be steadily growing in popularity. As of now. 
the Bergamot, the hand Speece sings lead for, are an LLC 
(a legally formed and protected company), have their own 
record label, and have an album release on March 20. The 
Bergamot has had a lot of other excitement already this year. 
The band has headlined in Chicago twice and did a radio 
interview with WGN Chicago in the Tribune Tower during 
which they had a question-and-answer session and were able 
to play four of their songs. 

Speece and boyfriend Nathan Hoff started the band late 
last year after spending several years playing music together. 
They've dated for six years and have been writing and playing 
music together for the seven years Uiey've known each other. 
Furthermore, they've worked together at a musical studio for 
anumberofyear5, 

"We added the drummer and the bassist a few months 
ago and it has all clicked," Speece said. Since bringing in 
Andrew Teeple on bass and Grant Inman on drums, the band 
has nourished beautifully. Spaces allied on describing their 
music as alternative and explained that their influences 
range from Motown to Radiohead. Speece also mentioned 
the Beatles, James Taylor, and loni Mitchell when discussing here at IPFW. 



her personal influences. The band as a whole plays funk, R &amp; 
B, folk music, and hard rock. 

As she's been writing more and more music, she's been 
realizing that she wants her music to mean something. The 
mark of good music is the impact it has on your life, and 
Speece wants to make sure her music, if written carefully and 
purposefully, will "touch lives, connect with people, and make 
their days change significantly." Speece loves to connect 
with people. She's working on a double major in media and 
public communications and interpersonal organization, so 
spending time taJking to people is one thing she thoroughly 
enjoys. (In fact, when we sat down to talk, it turned from 
an interview to a long, relaxing, interesting conversation.) 
Speece's boyfriend and band mate Hoff is also working on 
a double major, but his is more finance-oriented. Speece 
hopes to be able to handle the publicity side of the band, 
while Hoff handles the finances. Speece, while discussing 
possible future endeavors, said she was optimistic about how 
far the band will go. 

Despite the diversity of their music, The Bergamot 
generally plays concerts on Thursday nights. While they are 
able to play Friday and Saturday shows, they usually don't, 
simply because they are not a cover band. Those Thursdays, 
during which they do perform, they can be seen at Columbia 
Street West. The most recent weekend show they had was 
March 6 at the Dash-In, opening fdr national artist Ellis. 

Students will likely be able to see Speece playing more and 
more shows around town in her remaining amount of time

One-man Indie band inspired by Zelda 



By Hana Al Hawash 

hanahawaih BgrnaN .com 

It really is hard to describe some things in one short sentence, and 
Beacons is no exception. 

Beacons, or Mason Hunter, is a one-man-band in the self described 
genre of Indie/Jungle/Pop. The amazing thing about this description is 
its' precision. Upon hearing his song entitled "Cherub Shrines" you will 
immediately imagine yourself in a jungle in India, sitting around with 
Bengal tigers (funglc) while Hindu priests play the Sitar (Indie) with Hunter 
mixing in his pop beats from the planet of Neptune (Pop). 

Hunter, a Homestead high school graduate, is currently working on his 
first official album called "The Long Stretch Out to See" and is hoping to 
release it in the next few months. He has been working with his music since 
he was a kid and has been in a few bands over the years. He started out in a 
punk band in seventh grade, and then moved on to a hardcore band called 
Alternate Endings where he was into vocals. After that he played keys for 
The Ready Set and was also with a band called Saints around the same 
time. He sings, mixes, plays and produces all of his own music and has 
since he started. 

Hunter gets a lot of influence from a video game he played called Zelda 
saying that "the music from that game is really different from what people 
had heard and it is very orchestrated. It seems kind of nerdy, but whatever. 
We all kind of emulate somebody to get our sound; I definitely draw from 
Animal Collective, The Beatles and The Shins. Pretty much anything I 
listen to, if I hear something cool that will stick in my head." 

This lyric from his personal favorite song, "Withdrawn,'" is an excellent 
example of the theme of his entire album, which Hunter says is all about life 
experiences and letting go of the negative to pursue the positive aspects in 
life. He is all about being himself, doing what he loves and relaxing, which 
is reflected in his life motto of the day: "lust relax, I feel like people wig 
so much about little things and you just need to chill, just relax and take 
things at your own pace." 

For now, Hunter plans to play more shows and work on finishing his 
album to get it distributed to the masses. Someday he hopes to make it big 
and spread his love for music and maybe eventually even produce. 

"I always want to have a musical project; I'm never going to stop." he

happenings and developments.

Artist Brendan Kelly/ loeMcMahon 

Album: Wasted Potential 

Label: Red Scare /Anchorless 

Release Date: March 16, 2010 

Sounds Like: Acoustic renditions of punk 

songs. 

Rating: 4 15 

Brendan Kelly of the Lawrence Arms and 
Joe McMahonofSmokeorFire have teamed 
up to release "Wasted Potential", a collection 
of acoustic versions of their bands' songs 
along with lawbreaker and Johnny Cash 
covers. 

The album is raw with every intention 
of being such- Kelly utilizes his voice in 
two different styles, one of which being the 
triumphant sing/scream that he uses in 



the majority of Lawrence Arms' songs and 
the other being a more toned down, almost 
melancholy, droning. Surprisingly enough, 
his voice suits the pairing with an acoustic 
guitar very well. 

McMahon's songs seem to run a little more 
smoothly than Kelly's do, probably partly due 
to Kelly being a bassist and McMahon being 
a guitarist, marking the stylistic transition a 
litde bit easier. 

The songs flow along the album gracefully, 
nothing really seeming too out of place or 
unnecessary. If these songs we not of "sing 
along" quality before, they most certainly 
are now. Both musicians do well to take 
songs from their bands and change the tones 
entirely, marking this album perfect for 
summer gatherings around a campfire. 




Artist: Streetlight Manifesto 

Album: 99 Songs of Revolution vol I 

Label: Victory 

Release Date: March 16, 2010 

Sounds Like: A half-hearted collection 

of covers by a ska band that is obviously 

tired. 

Rating: 2/5 

Victory Records is putting out a 
collection of nine 11 track albums of covers 
by genre specific bands on their label. 
The first in the series has a fun collection 
of songs on it. ranging from "Hell" by 
The Squirrel Nut Zippers to "Such Great 
Heights" by Iron and Wine. Unfortunately, 
though, either front-man Tomas Kalnoky 
is tired of the label, tired of making music, 



or tired of producing quality. 

The concept of the album sounds 
great and it has potential to be a lot of 
fun, however early on it's pretty obvious 
that they could care less about what they 
are recording. As a fan of Streetlight 
Manifesto, it's difficult to watch them fall 
victim to this. 

A reasonable explanation could be 
that Streetlight has made it abundandy 
clear that they hate being a part of Victory 
records and, as record contracts go, they 
are bound to releasing a certain amount 
of material via Victory. It could be too, 
though, that the band has simply lost 
touch. This is their second cover album 
in the last seven years and far more of a 
disappointment than the first

Student Senate funding continues to fall 



By Luke Henkenius 

h en I It0 1 Si In nStn U.l ptw.ed u 

It seems that the Student Senate has run out of 
money. Over the past 8 months of the fail semester 
and the beginning ofthe spring semester, the amount 
of funding available to student orginizations has 
steadily gone down. This includes funding for both 
campus activities and for travel. 

The availability of funds going down has been at- 
tributed to the increase in business that the Senate 
has received over the past couple of years. While the 
total number of funding requests made by student 



organizations was only 115 in the 2007-2008 year, it 
went up to 139 in the 2008-2009 year, and this year, 
it has gone up to a total of 204. One fact that points 
to this increase in business is that, in prior years, the 
Senate membership has had more numbers at the 
start of the academic year, in the 2009-2010 season 
membership at the end of February has increased 
from between 15 and 20 to more than 25. Further- 
more, it seems that the Senate has recently had to be- 
gin turning down requests for funding, as the amount 
available decreases. 

Kody Tlnnel, Vice President of Legislation, states 
that "Generally, we don't run out of funding until 




April." There seems to be a steady trend, the amount 
of available funds is being streched out thinner. Tin- 
nel guesses that the reason is because students are 
becoming more aware of the availability of funding 
for student run organizations, and are beginning to 
take adavantage. The organizations that have re- 
quested money in years prior continue to do so, and 
new requests are coming in all the time. Although 
the lack of funding may be seen as a bad thing, Tinnel 
thinks it is good that the students are becoming more 
aware of their opportunities. However, it seems that 
with the current lack of funding it might now be up to 
the student organizations to raise funds of their own.
