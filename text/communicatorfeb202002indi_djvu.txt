lU's business school to help 
establish MBA prograin in Croatia 



BLOOMINGTON, Ind. — (lU 
News) Indiana University's 
Kelley School ol Business will 
help Croatia's lour universities 
to establish an international- 
standard MBA program that will 
help build a climate for econom- 
ic growth and loster stability 
among Ihe nations ol the former 
Yugoslavia, 

The VS. State Department has 
awarded a 5320,000 grant to the 
Kelley School, which will assist 
the Republic of Croatia's lout 
universities in establishing an 
English- language MBA program. 

The Consortium ol Faculties 
of Economies in Croatia (CFEC), 
ivhich includes the University of 
Zagreb, the University of Split, 
the University of Riitfea and the 
University ol Osijck, will work 
with faculty from the 'Kelley 
School to design , ' ' 



■iablc. ; 



-lablc t 



MBA program to serve the needs 
of Croatia and the ividcr region. 
"With this new program in 
Croatia, the Kelley School is 
building on its considerable 
experience in the trarwition 
economies, ol Eastern Europe 
and our experience in develop- 
ing and implementing new 
degree programs to meet market 
needs and shjdent enpeclatiotu," 
said Kelley School Dean Dan 
Dallon. "We look forward to 
working with faculty Irom 



English -language MBA program. 
This effort extends and comple- 
ments our previous program 
development efforts in Hungary 
and Slovenia," 

Bruce Jaflee, Kelley School 
associate dean for academics, 
will serve as the project's ditec- 



cessful MBA progr 
involves creating sound admin- 
istrative policies and procedures. 
This pro)ecl will provide oppor- 
tunitics'for Kelley School staff to 
be integrally involved, as wclL 

One of the main problems fac- 
ing Croatian enterprises is the 
serious lack of qualified man- 
agers, including practitioners 
and policymakers who are able 
to diagnose and -olve current 
problems, and also to plan strate- 
gically lor Ihe future. In order to 
grow. Croatia's businesses must 
participate more actively and 
cllectively in international mar- 
kets, and expertise for doing so 
must be developed more broadly 
and at a higher level. 

In the lost decade, more than 
140,000 young college-educated 
Croatians have left Ihe country, a 
trend that has severely impacted 
the nation's economic growth. In 
mid-October. Croatian President 
Stjepan Mesic called together 
representatives of the govern- 
ment and the busini^ss communi- 
ty to dL-iCuss the netd to establish 



a stronger link between the 
country's educational institu- 
tions and the pressing needs ol 
Ihe labor market. 

This new centralized English- 
language MBA program should 
contribute significantly to meet- 
ing these needs. Regionally- 
based, it will also play a central 
role in educating generations ol 
business professionals who will 
form a strong network of person- 
al and business relations. This 
network will be imporlant in 
building stronger economic ties 
among the countries of the for- 
mer Yugoslavia and elsewhere. 
In doing so. it will also make a 
significant contribution to stabil- 
ity in the region. 

The proaram will lav the 
groundwork for an expanded 
network ol faculty and graduate 
students in Cenlral and Eastern 
Europe, a primary interest of the 
Kelley School for many decades. 

With strong partnerships 
in Hungary and Slovenia, 
Croatia's neighbors, Ihe Kelley 
School will be able to include Ihe 
CFEC program and its faculty 
and shidents in this active regiori- 
al partnership. 

The program will Ije based in 
Zadar. a mid-sized city on the 
Adriatic coast (population 
100,000), The mayor of Zadar. 
Bozidar Kalmeta. has provided a 
building for the program.

yeais ago at Germanlusl here in Fort Wayne. 

For those of you who may be unfamil- 
iar, Germanfcst is a celebration oF German 
heritage held each summer. Housed in a 
lent downloivn, the festivities mdude per-

parlicipalc in a rousing rendition o( Ihe 
Chicken Dance." And o( course, perhaps 
the thing lor which Cermanfest is best 
known— beer. 

Now, wilh this background informa- 
tion, il may become painlully apparent that 
beer, iaree crowds, Dcei. an outdoor venue 
and well, more beer, can lead to an inleresl- 
ing bathroom situation, namely the use o( 
Ihe port-a-potty. 

Being a somewhat sheltered person 
(and apparently luckier than I realized), 1

be disturbed, I was able lo take in my sur- 
roundings. A non-Hushing toilet sat mches

have the common seiue lo wash her hands.

stand for equal ri^ts. Many liberals stand for unequal rights whiles 
hidingundet Ihe umbrella of 'equal rights.' Let megivcyoujti.st ' 
one ctamplc of liberals standing for special rights. 

Liberals are, for the most p.ut tVoOioice. belie\-ing that it is 
solely 3 right of the mother to choose it she disircA lo allow her 
baby to be bom or if she ivishcs lo end her Kiby's lite 

Asa male, if 1 choose tohavcsv.v wilh my girlinend and she

believes I have no ri^l lo decide the life or dcalh of my own child. \ 
Let me give you a ouick biology lesson. In case you didn't know it 
yet, storks don't deliver babies. Babies are conceived when Ihe 
sperm of a man meels the egg ot a woman. You see, il lakes both a 
mar and woman to make a baby- 
When you take away my right lo make decisioiw tegatding

you are giving my girlfriend special ti^ls, and that is not fair. We 
are all equal, thus, ine lerm "equal rights," You sec, in any icbtion-

to say -No" lo sex.

obviously not ma Into enough lo be having sex. 

Liberals Irv lo portray the rro-Litc movement 
and pro-man. when the I'co-Lile movement is just Standing for Ihc 

!)roli.\:tion of equal rights. Both individuals, wiielhcr mollxcr ot 
ather, deserve lo have a say in the life Ihey have created together. 
Quite simply, it is not fair lo declare thai a falher has no say in the 
decision of whether or not his child will he allowed lobe bom. 

The Pro-Choicc movement would have you believe thai, in 
order lo be classified as Pro-Llfe, you must be in opposition to 
abortion in any circumstance, even in ca.ws of rape, incest or 
endangermcnt of the mother's life. 

The fact is just Ihe opposite. If you can recall George W. Bush's 
stance on abortion, he is Pro-Life. and would never accept being 
called Pro-Choice. Yet Bush opposes abortion, except in case of 
rape, incest and when Ihe mollicr's life Ls in danger, 

Vou see. Pro-Life simply means that you don't believe thai a 
woman should have the right to end Ihe bfc of the child as a means 
of birlh control. Pro-Choice means that you believe Ihat a father has 
no choice, and th.it a woman not only has her choice, but licr 
child's father's choice, as well. 

Think about Ihat for a minute. Don't lake the all the m^ia's 
reporhne as fact. Don't think thai Pro-Life people are psycho righl- 
winged ranalics. The majoritv of the American populalion holds to 
a Pro-Life stance similar lo that of President Hush. 

As college students, I don'l believe we should blindly follow 
Jn Ihc moral decline of our country and continue to trivlalixca tin&gt;' 
life thai took two people — one female and one male — lo produce, 
and turn that life into a fierce a tgii men t. 

Tlie argument should fiave laken place long ago. in Ihe bed- 
room. II you aren't strong enough to say "No" in the bedroom, then 
allow me to offer you some advice. 

Simply put, don't let yourself be put in a sihjahon where yuu 
may be forcM to compromise. You have a choice, whether you are 
female or male. Set firm in your mind what you choose lo do. and 
when you do il. sland up and laki^ responsibilily for your actions. 

Don't be afraid to sland up to the powers that be and Say 
"No" in Ihc bedroom. For a lot of people, thai is Ihe only choice 
Ihal they're left wilh. 

It's not that hard, really. After all, no means no. 



Standing tall sometimes means being willing to bend 



By Stephanie Sample, Slalf Writer 

Although I have grown to appreciate and 
expect Ihe painful chill of our norlnem Indiana 
winlers, I do no! leel al all guilty for t&gt;cing so 
happy about the relatively mild one we have eipe- 
rienced this year. However, Jack Frost did send us 
Ihal ice storm three weeks ago, just lo prove Ihat 
IV e had not been overlooked. 

Sine* he is apparently making so few appear- 
ances this year, he has made sure that Ihe time he 
does put in is well spent. Being a city-dweller, the 
storm produced no real emergencies or obstacles 
tointenupl my regular schedule. My out-of-toivn 
friends, however, were not so lucky. 

1 heard countless horror stories of week-long 
power outages and heroic acts of bravery lo save 
quickly- thawing, perishable food items. While my 
country-folk friends were learning how lo cope 



trees remaining in my pari of lotvn. 

For those of us who made it lo school the day 
after Ihc storm, we got lo see our campus dressed 
up like a winicrtime fairy land. Since this was the 
day that glass-blowing artist Dale Chlhuly was in 
town, my imagination aulomalically likened the 
dear, sparkling ice thai covered the trees to the 
skilled touch of a glass artisan. 



The shot of the day (on campus) was a tree 
between Ncff Hall and the Science Building. The 
weigh! of the ice caused Ihe tree lo bow. so that Ihe 
lop of its head grazed the ffosled. crispy grass 
benealh. creating a solid arch of ivood and ice. I 
almosi never slop in transit between classes, bul 
the image of thai tree manipulated in such a way 
stopped me in mid-slride. 

1 stood there, dumbfounded. I was reminded 
ol a story I read as a child. 11 was a fable aboul a 
reed anci a tree. A storm comes and the reed sur- 
vives because it moved wilh the elements. The 
tree cracked and fell with the force of the wind. 

The intended moral is this: II Ls belter to 
move with the elements than lo sland rigidly and 
break because of them. I always appreciated the 
little tale, Hmvever, I noiv tuve many problems with il. 

First of all. as you can see. a Iree can bend 
with Ihe slotm ana survive, same as the reed, 
although these bending Irecs arc much less preva- 
lent. Tliere are some people who stand firm, but 
know ho*v to bend when they have lo. It is an 
in|uslice tJial these people, the bending trees, go 
urunentioned in the fable. 

Next, breaking doesn't always mean death or 
failure. \Vhen I pulled in the driveway of my 
childhood home after my encounter with Ihe 
bending tree. I noticed that the Russian olive tree 
in our side yard was destroyed. Russian olives are 



very brillle, bul hearty trees and in the sprmg Ihcir 
flowers produce a sweet fragrance Ihat permeates 
the enhre neighborhood. It was depressing lo gaze 
at It in all of ils dismantled misery. 

However, there is still hope. That tree has 
been chopped down, destroyed by strong winds 
or ruined by an ice slorm once every five years for 
as long as I can remember, and eveiy lime it pows back. 

My family has accepted the tree and ils 
unwillingness lo die. We quit trying lo destroy it 
years ago. Noiv I find myself at a place I have been 
m.iny limes before. Can our Russian olive come 
back after yel another blow? It's Ihe same anlici- 
palion and nervousness Ihal basketball fans feel 
every lime Michael Ionian comes out of retirement 

So really, the old fable of the reed and the Iree 
should be updated lo mclude tivo other possibih- 
lies: The tree that bends and Ihe tree Ihat breaks, 
but keeps coming back, Wilh the addilion of these 
tivo elements, the whole moral of Ihe slory is lost. 
Mother Goose would be mighty upsel with me. 
but I am a member of Ihc press and it is my 
responsibilily to expose fallacies. 

My new and improved version of the fable 
conlaiitt four characters: the reed, the liee Ihal 
breaks, Ihc tree Ihal bends and the tree Ihat breaks, 
bul keeps coming back. 

A reed thai bends and moves wilh the ele- 
ments is graceful and fluid, but also very fragile. A 



reed can be mowed over, stepped on or uprooted 
by human hands. Being flexible is good — being 
too flexible and easily uprooted is not. 

TTic tree that breaks without regenerating is 
still Ihe character that is Ihe leasl attractive, ^1osl 
would nol want to be represented by Ihe slubtram 
tree that breaks. 

The tree Ihat bends and moves wilh the 
storm IS beautihil in its contorted state, bul il is 
othenvisc just another skirmy Iree planted in an 
allcmpl to bring some semblance of^nalure lo our 
urban surroundings. Normally, we walk on by. 

The Russian olive thai grows back after fre- 
quent attempts lo destroy it is not so graceful as 
tnc tree that Dends. but when il is healthy and pul 
together, il is the most beautiful Iree 1 know. 11 
seems Ihat all the possibilities have an Achilles' 
heel, just proving llial there are no sure bets. 

Although the moral of the onginal fable fails 
when updated, my version of Ihe tale provides 
one of equal importance. All but Ihc broken tree 
thai refuses to bend will survive the slorm. The 
character an individual chooses to emulate is 
largely a mailer of personality and character. 

1 admire the grace of a fragile, flexible reed, I 
pity the stubbonuiess of a broken Iree Ihal refuses 
to grow. I marvel al the splendor of a tree thai 
bends, bul I'm secretly rootmg for the tree that 
stands firm and, although broken, refuses to die.

The dangers lurking in Ecstasy 

Use of recreational drug has many side effects 



By Meg Ross, RN. Guest Writer 

Ecstasy was first discovered in 1913 and 
introduced as an appetite suppressant in 1914. 
The Federal Drug Aaminislration did not legal- 
ize Ecstasy because ol the severity of its side effects. 

The dnig's potential for recreational use 
was overlooki'd until Ihc 1960s By the 1970s, 
psycliialnsis were rallying together in hopes ol 
receiving approval to use Ecstasy as a form ol 
psychiatric treatment. Ecstasy enables the 
patient lo lose his or her verbal inhibitions dur- 
ing a therapy session, thus aiding the psychia- 
trist with treatment. 

In 1988, Ecstasy was olHcially added to the 
FDA's list ol scheduled narcotics. Ecstasy 
received a rating of Schedule 1, joining Ihe likes 
ol cocaine, marijuana and heroin. 

llisthedrug'sfalsesenseofecstasy Ihathas 
kept the paily going. According to a report in 
"Altoholism and Drug Abuse Weekly, total 
emergency department visits involving Ecstasy 
inocascd 58 percent from 1999 to 2000. 

The United Slates Department of Justice 
estimates that over two million tablets are smug- 
gled into the United Stales each week. The aver- 
age cost of a single pill ol Ecstasy can range from 
as low as S7 lo as high as S30. 

A variety of olher substances can be mixed 
in with Ecstasy during manu la during, increas- 
ing the drug's potential danger. Ecstasy can be 
combined with methadone, iSO, opiates such as 
heroin and Hentanyl, or strong anesthetics such 
as Kclamine 

A person's emotional state is balanced by a 
system ofneurotransmitlcr^ which are chemicals 
in the brain. An excess of these chemicals 
induces a stale ol euphoria; whereas a depletion 



into Ihe brain, causing a false seruc of euphi 
or ecstasy. After the stores of chemicals are 
ie!ca.scd. the brain is then lacking Ihe amount ol 
chemicals needed to maintain a balanced emo- 
tional slate, hence a slate of depression or com- 
ing doivn effect is experienced. 

Researchers Zakzanis and Young from the 
University ol Toronto conducted a one-year long 
study lo examine the neurolovic potential of 



Ecslasy Their findings, published in Ihe "Journal 
of Neurology." concluded Ihat the brain can lake 
up to a year to replenish the chemicals needed lo 
maintain a balanced emotional slate and proper 
memory functioning after using Ecstasy 

Ecstasy was shown to cause damage lo 
brain neurons that release serotonin. The dam- 
age was shown to increase with repeat uses. 

The inability lo recall a person's first and 
last name, the route to a destination and loss of 
vocabulary are potential adverse eflecis enperi- 
enced by repeal users of Ecstasy. Heavy users 
can continue lo experience memory loss up to 
two weeks after discontinuing use ol Ihe drug. 

An episode ol acute psychosis related to 
Ecstasy use was documented in the "Journal of 
Psychoactive Drugs." A 26-year old man was 
admitted to the emergency room after viciously 
attacking seven automobile drivers. That night 
his friends had dropped a single pill of Ecstasy 
inIo his drink. 

■ ; left Ihe bar, he began lo experience 



Alter days al investigating. Ihe only logical 
conclusion was Ihat Ihe otherwise healthy indi- 
vidual had esperienced a psycholic episode. 
According to Inc authors, tnere are 12 docu- 
mented cases ol psycholic episodes related to 
use of Ecstasy, 

Ecstasy involves a deception ol Ihc setises. 
The feelings ol euphoria, well-being and 
enhanced mental and/or emotional clarity are 
the result of Ihe maiupulation ol Ihe brain's 
chemicals. This manipulation has been docu- 
mented to leave the user wilh the risk of devel- 
oping permanent brain damage. 

Young adults and teenagers seem lo believe 
the promise of an out-of-body experience, but 
are unaware of or choose lo ignore the dangers 
that lurk behind the coating of each pill. 

These parly-goers are putting their lives at 
risk for the promised experience of reaching a 
stale ol ecstasy.

"It is possible thai spring's

Even though Indiana has 
experienced some periods of 
weather reaching 40 degrees and 
above, bulbs are planted four lo 
eight inches belotv ground level 
and remain cooler than the out-

through a chilling period of 10 to 
13 weeks at 40 degrees or below

Binge drinking and college life 



By C&gt;THhia Volk. RN, Guest U'nter 

Many surveys and studies 
have examined 6inge druildng 
by college students. According 
lo an article in the "Journal of 
American Health," colleges can 
be divided mio Uxree categories: 
high-binge schools, in which 
more than 50 percent of the slu- 
denls are binge drinkers, medi* 
um-bingc schools, in ivhich 36 lo 
50 percent of the students arc 
binge drinkers; and loiv-binge 
schools, m which zero to 35 per- 
cent of the students binge. 

Frequent binge drinking 
makes up two-lhirds of all alco- 
hol consumed by college 
drinkers These sludcnls con- 
sume a median of 14^ drinks 
per week. Binge drinkers also 
account for three-fifths of Ihe 
most serious alcohol-rclaled 
problems on campuses. 

College students use a gen- 
der-specific definition of binge 
drinking. Typically, males have 
to drink more lo be classified as 
a binge drinker. For example, a 
male musi have five drinks in a 
row lo be considered a binge 
drinker, whereas a female may 
only drink four. 

Sororities or fraternities 
and athletes were the Iwo 
groups reported to binge drink

What is more likely is that they will

Pi's problem of the month 

Each month for the remainder of the aca- 
demic year, the IPFW Math Club PI will pose a 
problem, and everyone is imited to submit a 
solution. At the end of the year, the under- 
graduate student who has submitted the best 
set of soluhons ivill receive a gift certificate. 

Soluhons to February's problem should be 
submitted to PI. department of Mathematical 
Sciences. Room 200. Kettler Hall, either in per- 
son or by campus mail by 5 p.m.. March 8. 

February's Problem 



On Feb. 2, the date, written in year-month- 
day format, was 02-02-02, which uses only 
two different digits. In the same format 
(with year, month and day each using two 
digits), what is the first day in this millenni- 
um that uses six different digits? 

As a bonus problem, find the total number 
of days in the millennium that will use six 
different digits. 



Because the January problem was late in 
appearing, the deadline for solutions will also 
be extended to March 8. In case you missed it, 

here is the original problem: 

January's Problem 



The challenge for this month is to deter- 
mine, with explanation, for which positive 
numbers ii is it possible to divide a square 
into H smaller squares. (The small squares 
may be of different sizes.)
