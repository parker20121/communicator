Adults learn ISPGA President's 

A-Z's of campus 
at ASTRO 



report blasts senate 



By Megan McArdlc 
Managing Editor 

More than 50 adult students gath- 
ered Thursday in Walb Memorial 
Union Ball Room to to take pari in 
Adult Student Reentry and Orientation 
(ASTRO). 

The orientation, put on before the 
start of each semester by the Center for 
Women and Reluming Adults, gives 
adults new U&gt; campus a chance to look 
around and ask questions before their 
first day of classes. 

Lois Ketlcrer, organizer of ASTRO 
and secretary al the Center for Women 
And Returning Adults, snid the pro- 
gram is designed to "help them (new 
adult students) get acclimated to cam- 
pus." 

Ketlercr said different students 
come for different parts of ASTRO. 
Students who come for the whole pro- 
gram toured campus, listened to a wel- 
come speech and beard from another 
adult who overcome great odds to cam 
her degree. They also bad the opportu- 
nity 10 attend a variety of workshops 
and participate in a qucslion-and- 
answer session with Joyce Slauffer. 
professor of English and Linguistics, 
Diana Zonk, professor of psychological 
sciences, and David Young, professor 
of mathematics. 

Gay Nelson, a returning adult stu- 
dent, said the program was "very, very 
informative," 

"The study tips were great I haven't 
been to school since high school. 1 
think the scheduling lips were also 
helpful" 



Kettcrcr said students are encour- 
aged to bring (heir spouse, "especially 
if they're nol too keen on their com- 
ing." 

She said it gives tbcm an idea what 
the expectations are. 

A variety of workshops offered stu- 
dents the opportunity to overcome some 
of their anxieties about going back to 

One workshop titled "Math 
Anxiety" was attended by at least 20 
people, Catherine Hansm an -Ferguson, 
incoming coordinator for the Center for 
Women and Returning Adults, said the 
Math and Writing Anxiety workshops 
are always popular. 

Other workshops included: "College 
from A to Z." an introduction to suc- 
ceeding as on adult student; "Note-tak- 
ing"; "Time Management"; and 
"TRANSFER-mation," information for 
transfer students. 

One workshop new to this semes- 
ter's ASTRO was "Waiting successfully 
in College: A Writing Center 
Workshop." 

Carol Roberts, professor of English, 
said the workshop is designed to take a 
positive approach lo writing. "We give 
them specific steps to writing in col- 
lege." During the workshop. Roberts 
outlined those eight steps and answered 
students' questions about them. 

HBnsman-Ferguson said she was 
pleased with the woy the event went "I 
think we've had a pretty good turnout 
for a cold night." 

She said typically they have higher 
attendance in the fall than in the spring.

In a blistering report lo the 
Student Senate, President Mark 
King lambasted the senators for 
just "getting by." King tasked 
them to meet the "challenges of 
the offices [they] hold." 

He further added that the 
IPSGA has "failed to live up to 
the challenges [they] face" and 
that they cannot "plug along 
with the same old lackluster 



effort and lack of spirit." 

Last semester. King was very 
proud of what the Senate accom- 
plished, especially the passing of 
the Technology Fee referendum. 

Other accomplishments King 
noted were the expansion of 
Senate membership to include 
20 active members and the 
"most successful semester of 
programming in recent memory" 
by the Student Activities Board. 

Special note was given to vice 
president of student activities 



Elaine Linder, as well as all 
members of the SAB. 

King's second semester agen- 
da consists of finding new ways 
to serve the students, improving 
existing services and initiating 
new services. 

King knows that his final 
semester as president can be 
very productive, but without 
complete dedication to these 
outlined principles the IPSGA 
would fall short of its goal.

In an attempt lo stay on the culling 
edge of the information revolution, 
IPFW's computer and data process- 
ing (C&amp;DP) service has updated their 
VAX system. 

The new system runs three to four 
times faster and significantly reduces 
the ongoing maintenance costs. 

Director of C&amp;DP, Ron Cigna 
said, "We needed more capacity.,. and 
the recurring costs of the system are 
extraordinarily high." 

The new system increases CPU 
and disk capacity approximately 40 
percent, according lo Cigna. 

The old VAX system has been 
replaced by a newer and "more effi- 
cient version of the same system," 
according lo William Baden of 



C&amp;DP. 

"The new system will reduce 

maintenance costs and pay for itself 
in about a year and a half," added 
Baden. 

Seven years ago. C&amp;DP replaced 
one of the original systems and ihe 
other was replaced Ave years back. 

Cigna further added. "We expect 
to have three years or life out of this 
system." 

"With a three-year life and an 
eighteen-month return on our invest- 
ment, I believe it is a good invest- 
ment," declared Cigna. 

Updating VAX will save approxi- 
mately S20.0OO per year in recurring 
maintenance costs. 

Cigna speculated that one way it 
could become obsolete is a massive 
move towards network and desktop 
systems. 



Fort Wayne Newspapers 
offers students reduced rate 



By S. Brant Kelley 
Editor-fn-Chlef 

Fori Wayne Newspapers, Inc. 
was at IPFW on Jan. 5 and sold 
semester-long subscriptions io The 
Journal Gazette and The News 
Sentinel for S12.75. 

The agreement was initialed by 
Fort Wayne Newspapers, Inc., 
according to David McCaslin, 
solicitor. He said IPSGA will 
receive money from the company. 
IPSGA President Mark King said 
Fori Wayne Newspapers contacted 
him first. He said the company had 
a new advertising manager and "he 
knew this sort of discount was 



popular on other campuses." 

IPSGA President Mark King 
said. "No student government 
money was used." He said an out- 
side organization who wants to 
advertise or sell products on cam- 
pus must be sponsored by an on- 
campus organization or die univer- 
sity. He also said the business 
office dictates that any organiza- 
tion wishing to sell or advertise on 
campus must cither offer a reduced 
price to students or provide a 
unique product or service. 

Jeff lohnson, a crew manager, 
said Fort Wayne Newspapers, Inc. 
may also reach similar agreements 
with Tri-State University, 



Huntington College and Defiance 
College. St. Francis College may 
also be considered. He said the 
program started late. 

Johnson said the S12.75 rate 
was a special student rate, and was 
designed to sell subscriptions. 
When asked what ihe special rate 
would do for Fort Wayne 
Newspapers, Inc., he said the 
increased circulation will help 
advertising. The advertisers will be 
more willing to advertise with a 
larger circulation. 

McCaslin said he was pleased 
with student response so far. 



Group travel funding 
officially refused 



by Nol T. Beckley 
News Edilor 

IPSGA will no longer fund any 
special-interest group travel 
expenses due to a decision made 
by (he administration. 

The decision was made by the 
IPFW business office to expressly 
deny IPSGA from funding groups 
like the Ceramics Club and 
Hispanos Unidos lo Havel io off- 
campus events. 

In ihe previous semester, the 



senate passed six bills totaling 
$6300 for travel by special interest 
groups. 

Mark King expressed concern 
about last semester's funding trend, 
"We failed to meet the challenges 
presented by our positions. ..the 
Senate's primary form of work lasi 
semester consisted of funding spe- 
cial-interest group travel." 

Groups wishing io travel io off- 
campus events must now raise

Cabinet seats receive only 
satisfaction; no compensation 



By Melissa young 
Staff Writer 

Last semesier, IPSGA president 
Mark King established several new 
positions within the executive 
branch of student government. At 
first, there was talk that compensa- 
tion would accompany the posi- 
tions, but according to Jerry 
Richardson, IPSGA director of 
communications, that will not be 
possible. 



"We are looking into the possi- 
bility of compensating those peo- 
ple, bui is just wasn't possible in 
our budget or with our relationship 
wiih the university," Richardson 
said. 

Richardson believes, however, 
that the work thai accomplished by 
the new positions is more important 
than the nominal compensation. 
"I'm doing this because I enjoy it," 
Richardson said. 

The positions were created io 



assist the sludeni body presideni in 
better executing his duties. The new 
positions included director of multi- 
cultural affairs, director of interior 
affairs, direc lor of external affairs, 
and directors of communications. 

Both Vice Chancellor of 
Financial Affairs Waller Branson 
and Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Frank Borelli were unavail- 
able for comment. 



mitmenl will prevent us from 
fully utilizing the groundwork 
we have laid for the future," said 
King. 

King also called for the resig- 
nation for any senator who is 
unable commit completely. 

Vice president of legislation, 
Amy Sieenman, in total agree- 
ment with King said, "It's better 
you not be involved than lo put a 
half-hearted effort into 
[IPSGA]." 



Discount 
cards 

distributed to 
student body 



By Melissa Young 
SlafT Writer 

During the semester break, 
IPSGA began the printing of 
IPFW student discount cards. The 
cards open a door of discounts to 
students from 30 local merchants 
with products and services rang- 
ing from ice cream to car repair. 

"The discount cards have been 
printed and will be distributed by 
a bulk mailing lo all students. 
The mailing should he oul by the 
end of the week," IPSGA presi- 
dent Mark King said in a report 
(o the student senate. 

The cards do not expire until 
the last day of 1995, but do 
require a student identification 
card to use. 

The cards, however, will not 
only benefit IPFW students, but 
the companies who participated 
in the program as well. Vice 
President Jcrrv Schowe n( 
Collage Flowers, a participating 
merchant, fell the discount cards 
were a good marketing tool. "We 
generally don'l do any discounts, 
but it was a different marketing 
tool," Schowe said. 

Bui nol all of the participants 
were motivated at Ihe chance lo 
increase their business. Thomas 
Hoffman, D.D.S., is offering five 
percent off all services just 
because "il was a good thing to 
do for the students." 

The discount cards are not 
new; cards were primed last year 
bul did not have much success. 
"Last year we went through an 
outside company, and we thought 
that we could do it better in- 
house," said Jerry Richardson, 
director of communications. 
"And I think we did, because we 
went from having 10 or 12 mer- 
chants on Ihe card lo having 30." 

According lo Richardson, the 
previous card's lack of success 
stemmed from nol many students 
having access to them. He 
believes that with more mer- 
chants participating in Ihe pro- 
gram and the cards being mailed 
to every student, the card's suc- 
cess will be much improved.

Mike Heit. vice president of 
finance, said. These travel expens- 
es have been a ihom in ihe Purdue 
auditor's side." 

This decision will radically 
change the financial guidelines for 
doling out monies to special -interest 
groups, according (o Heit. 

Heit expressed dissatisfaction 
with certain senators who backed 
out of a trip to a leadership confer- 
ence. 

He said, "Student services funds 
have been wasted; if you back out 
you will be charged — effective 
immediately." 

"Special-interest student groups 
and individual students who are not 
traveling on official university busi- 
ness or as part of [the forensic 
league, IPSGA or athletics) are pro- 
hibited from receiving allocations 
for travel expenditure," quoted Heit 
from the rough draft of the official 
policy on this matter. 

The rough draft also said that any 
group or individual representing 
IPFW and traveling in their own 
interests is purely accidental is not 
benefiting the whole student body. 

An 'ad-hoc' committee is being 
formed by Heit to rewrite the finan- 
cial guidelines.

In search of... 
The best hot cocoa 



Kara Whiting 
Features Editor 

Well, my friends, il is a new 
year and we here at the 
Communicator, well at least me, 
feel that there is nothing thai cures 
the winter lime blues except a hot, 
steamy, rich cup of hot chocolate. 
It's not that 1 don't like winter, it's 
just when il is so cold that you 
cannot feel the tips of your fingers 
and the ice just never seems to 
come off your car windows. I long 
for the warm sun to touch my face 
and leave a healthy glow. But 
since it is January, and there is 
snow on the ground (finally), I 
feel it is important to all chocolate 
lovers to select the best hoi cocoa 
you can buy to make it through the 
winter. 

This week's rating system is 
based on marshmallows. One 
marshmallow means do not waste 
your money. Two marshmallows 
are okay. Three marshmallows 
means that this is something to 
talk about to your friends. But, 
bold up, four marshmallows, and 
you arc in heaven. So. kick hark 
and read this little article, build a 
fire, and grab a cup of hot cocoa 
after you read this. 

NESTLE HOT COCOA MIX 

This sweet-lasting cocoa is a 
delicious drink to have al the end 
of a long, bard day at work. For 
eight one-ounce packets at one 
gram of fat a pop, you can enjoy 
this beverage for S1.19/package, 
along with its 110 calories. With a 
nice, rich aftertaste, this particular 
cocoa received three marshmal- 
lows on this week's scale. 

ALPINE CONTINENTAL 
COCOAS 

Fust of all, you must know that 
this definitely is worth the sis 



grams of fat per serving. This 
cocoa was amazing. In fact, it was 
so amazing, that I cannot even go 
into enough detail to describe its 
richness in flavor, the smooth way 
it goes down your throat and that 
warm feeling you get in your 
cheeks from just one sip. For a 
price of S2.39 for six servings, you 
cannot go wrong. Therefore, I give 
this cocoa four marshmallows. 

SHOPPERS VALUE 

After tasting the Alpine 
Continental Cocoa, the Shoppers 
Value is disgusting. I could not 
believe how awful and bow 
watered down a hot cocoa could 
possibly be until I tried the 
Shoppers Value. There is only one 
good thing about this cocoa and 
that is that it only has one gram of 
fat per serving. But after you taste 
this, you'll understand why there 
is only one gram of fat. So, 
because of the taste (or lack there- 
of) Shoppers Value received a 
negative half on the marshmallow 
scale. 

HERSHEY'S HOT COCOA 
COLLECTION 

Here is one hoi cocoa that 1 
totally expected to be delicious, 
but after the first sip, I could not 
believe what my taste buds were 
telling me. This was a little bit bet- 
ter than the Shoppers Value, but 
again, taste was lacking. With 
three grams of fat a serving and al 
a cost of $1.33 for five packets, 
this cocoa only gets one-half of a 
marshmallow. 

CARNATION HOT 
COCOA MIX 

Well, I was so glad to try this 
cocoa mix after the last two, 
because this one was absolutely 
delicious. The taste was sweet and 



rich and the texture was thick and 
worth lasting. For only one gram 
of fat per serving and a cost of 
$1.75 for six packets, this sweet 
delight received three marshmal- 
lows on this week's scale. 

SWISS MISS HOT 
COCOA MIX 

All 1 have to say is that I have 
grown up with this particular 
cocoa and have always loved it. 
So, of course. I will be giving ihis 
cocoa rave reviews. The rich lex- 
lure, the smooth, sweet taste, ihe 
one-and-a-balf grams of fat per 
serving and ihe cost of $119 for 
ten packets gave this cocoa threc- 
and-a-half marshmallows out of 
four because it burnt my tongue, 
so the taste was nol so delightful 
this time, bul give me another cup 
and I am sure 1 will enjoy. 

SWISS MISS PREMIERE 
COCOAS 

This particular cocoa package 
comes with three different flavors 
chocolate raspberry, englisb toffee 
and Suisse chocolate truffle. The 
best out of ihe three is the choco- 
late raspberry flavor. This flavor 
receives the highest in today's 
test; five marshmallows out of a 
possible four. Yes, that's right. 
And once you've tasted this three 
grams of heavenly fat, you' II agree 
with me. For a total of six packets 
at a cost of $1 .73, you should real- 
ly try this cocoa for that one day 
when you come home from a long 
day at school, or at the office, or 
with the kids, and you are cold and 
just want to kick back and relax. 
Try the chocolate raspberry hot 
cocoa and you will feel so much 
better. So go build that fire and 
have a cup of hot, steamy, rich hot 
cocoa and treat yourself! 



Celebrity biography takes an 
in-depth look at James Dean 



Paul Tupper 
Features Writer 

Biographies of our favorite 
Hollywood stars can be written in 
two ways: a) tbey can go into 
detail about the truth, or b) they 
can make up outlandish lies in 
order to help sell a few copies. 
Keep both of these things in mind 
when reading "Boulevard of 
Broken Dreams" by Paul 
Alexander. 

The story is a touching one of a 
young boy bom to a poor family 
with a loving mother who dies 



young and a not-so-caring father. 
The boy finds passion and love in 
the an of acting and makes bis way 
to Los Angeles and New York to 
perfect his craft. Success finally 
comes to Ihe boy, but then he loses 
his life in a car accident at the 
young age of 24, just afier making 
only three films. The subject of 
Ihis biography is, of course, James 
Dean. 

Alexander reveals lhal ihe for- 
ever heartthrob was an open homo- 
sexual who slept his way to many 
early parts. The author is able to

Music 
Review: 

Mary J. Blige 



For those of you who fear ihai 
good R&amp;B only comes in the form of 
a group of four guys or three girls, 
take a listen to the new album by 
Mary J. Blige tilled "My Life," avail- 
able from Uplown/MCA Records 
Old school soul is alive and well, and 
Blige croons love's ups and downs 
and all arounds. 

This project is appropriately tided 
because Blige wroic or co-wrote most 
of the songs. The best quality of her 
craft is her ability to keep you guess- 
ing. "You Bring Me Joy" starts out 
funky but becomes a smooth groove 
when Blige lakes ihe mike. 

Not to say that this album doesn't 
have it's flaws. On the remake of 
"Mary Jane," written by Rick James, 
Blige sounds a bit silly singing 
"Come into my bedroom honey/What 
1 got will make you spend money." It 
is a line that's not politically correct 

For those of you looking for an 
addicting piano hook that kicked 
"Real Love" from her debut album 
"What's the 411?," it's nol here. Bul 
ihe album will keep you moving with 
a sense thai Blige is singing each 
song to you. So when she tells us (hat 
she just wanis to "Be Happy." we'd 
better listen. 

With her first album, she was 
called the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul. 
With "My Life," Mary J. Blige 
proves it.

The Communicator 



Thursday January [2. 1995 



Staff Editorial 



A more democratic Congress 
forms with GOP take over 



Before we start talking about the 
change of control in Congress, let 
us look at the idea of a Congress 
and the way it is supposed to work. 
It is supposed to be democratic, 
with every section of the country 
and of the population equally rep- 
resented. Even those who vehe- 
mently oppose the Republicans 
cannot deny that our system of 
government has worked fairly well 
so far. If it didn't work, the United 
Slates wouldn't be where it is 
today. One reason it works is the 
people get to choose who makes 
the laws and rules them. 

Those who didn't vote for the 
person who finally obtained the 
position are in the minority and 
should respect that. If you are 
upset about the change of power, 
keep this in mind. 

We at The Communicator, how- 
ever, arc not upset with the change. 
The Democrats held control for too 
long. It was undemocratic. It's 
about time for a change of power 
and what the Republicans have 
done so far hasn't been too shabby, 
cither. 

They've accomplished more so 
far than most of the recent 
Congresses did. If they live up lo 
their "Contract with America" the 
country should sec some major 



changes in the next few months. 

Although some of these reforms, 
such as the proposed cuts in the 
capital gains lax and deregulation, 
are clearly aimed at the upper class, 
they also have the potential to spur 
business activities and therefore 
help the economy. 

Some of the other changes are 
not as typically Republican. Who 
would have ever thought that they 
would vote to limit congressional 
terms? And what about campaign 
finance reform? 

If these reforms go through, 
they will benefit everyone. The 
Democrats need to realize this and 
support the Republicans on these 
issues, just as they wanted the 
Republicans to support them when 
they were in power. 

As for Health Care Reform, it 
looks as if it could be a dead issue. 
It definitely doesn't seem to be on 
the Republican agenda. Perhaps the 
proposed caps on the punitive dam- 
ages juries can impose will help 
curb rising health care cosis by 
decreasing insurance companies' 
potential liability. 

No matter what, it will be inter- 
esting to see what happens now 
that the shoe is on the other foot 
and the once-suppressed minority 
is in the majority. 




Letters to the Editor 



Students should go to school 
before starting their families 



Comment on Hollywood 

Book loses original feel 
in translation to movie 



To the Editor 

Sometimes in life, there just 
doesn't seem to be enough time in a 
day lo accomplish the important 

issues of living in this world. 
Therefore, prioritizing these issues to 
male life more manageable becomes 
a necessity. I think to myself, "If I 
had finished some of the things I had 
started when 1 was younger and had 
less responsibilities, maybe things 
would have been a lot easier now. 
Life is too short lo let it fly by!" 

I'm a 38-ycar-old male with a 
wife and two daughters, one in high 
school and the other in middle 
school. Both of my daughters arc 
very active in after-school activities. 
My wife needs help with Ibc girls, 
and we boih need time to nurture our 
relationship. My family is my num- 
ber-one priority. 

My job is very demanding of my 
time. Sometimes I work 10 lo 12 
hours a day. At (his point in time, my 
job is running seven days a week, 
The money is great, and I need my 
job. Unfortunately, it takes away 
from my number-one priority, my 
family. 

To improve the financial security 



for my family. I go to school. With 
(he demands for lime between my 
family and work, I take only one 
class a semesler. I'm a sophomore 
working toward an associate's 
degree. Sometime in the distant 
fuiurc, 1 hope lo receive a bachelor's 
degree. After high school. I complet- 
ed one full year of college. About 14 
years later, I decided to resume my 
education. I am now in my fifth year 
here at IPFW as a sophomore. Al this 
rate, Death will be a guest at my 
graduation. 

In conclusion, having a family, 
family activities, a job, and class to 
atlend, life has a tendency to become 
very complicated and rushed. It's 
important for you young people io 
take care of your education now, 
while you're still young and have less 
responsibility. I know the education 
at this lime means little to you, but 
take advantage of the time you have 
now lo get it. You will find that in the 
future, your education can make life 
easier and you won't have to let life 
fly by. 

Keith Kill 



To the Editor; 

For years, Hollywood has been 
transforming popular and classic 
literature into movies. Most of the 
lime, producers and directors take 
ihe authors and their views into 
consideration. But, as is usually 
the case, some things get lost in 
the translation. I am here to argue 
that, wilh books, there is nothing 
quite like the original. 

Such is the case with the new 
movie, based highly on Anne 
Rice's 1976 novel, "Interview wilh 
the Vampire." Being a fan of the 
mysterious and supernatural, as 
well as a good book, I was no 
stranger lo Rice's work. To most 
fans of the horror-fiction genre, 
Rice's name is synonymous with 
powerful, yet alluring and mysti- 
cal, writing. I bad started reading 
her book for a good month and a 
half in preparation of the film. Just 
recently, I viewed the movie. I'm 
glad I read the book. 

Albeit, the basic plot and 
premise of the book remained 
almost exactly the same. During 
important scenes, some were even 
quoted to the letter. And. yes, if 
someone were taken off the street 



and shown this movie, he or she 
would not be lost or confused. But, 
to me, the emotion of the film had 
been trimmed down. 

So much of the characters' true 
feelings and real reasons for doing 
certain things seemed to be miss- 
ing. In the book, Louis the mortal- 
turned- vampire attempts to gain 
the love of a plantation owner, 
Babette. After discovering what 
kind of creature be truly is, she 
totally denies his love and tries to 
destroy him, thinking he is a prod- 
uct of hell. This causes him to con- 
template on what he has become 
throughout the rest of the book. 
Other feelings, like how Louis tol- 
erates his companion Lestat, and 
how the child vampire, Claudia, 
really sees him, remain elusive in

In closing, no matter how much 
"the movie follows the book," 
according to reviewers, be aware 
not everything translates over, 
especially not emotion or mood. In 
my opinion, there is no substitute

Homosexually Speaking: 

Clinton left many unfulfilled promises 



By PaulTupper 

StalT Columnist 
A big happy 1995 to all my 
gay brothers and sisters on cam- 
pus. I hope your vacation was as 
satisfying as mine. It's good to be 
back; 1995 looks to be a good 
year. Unless, of course, you are a 
die-hard Democrat who is wor- 
ried what ihe next two years will 
bring. Let me be the one to say 
that it is all of our fault that the 
Republicans have control of both 
houses. 

In 1992, candidate Bill Clinton 
sent a message to gays by 
promising to help bring the 
homosexual community lo equal- 
ity. It was this promise that sent 
gays to the polls and elected 
Clinton president. The feeling in 
the community was of promise. 
The future for homosexuals 
looked bright. Finally we had 
elected a president who was sen- 
sitive to our feelings, when many 
previous presidents would not 
even acknowledge our existence. 
To many, it seems thai Clinton 
has not fulfilled his promises. But 
look at his efforts and hopefully 
you will see that it was the 
Republicans who have been hold- 
ing him back. Sure, Clinton has 
the power to allow gays into the 
military by executive order. And 
the fact that he did not do so does 



not make him gutless. You saw 
what debate the subject of gays In 
the military caused. Until wc are 
in his shoes, we cannot fathom 
the pressure that he was feeling. 

I have spoken to many homo- 
sexuals who voied In 1992, but 
not last November. By not going 
to the polls, we let the 
Republicans take over, big time. 
They are not going to give us 
heallh care. The Republican party 
is a party of reversal. They would 
like to see life back to the ways 
when women stayed home. 
blacks had a place In society 
below whites, and homosexuality 
was immoral. If you doubl this. 
look at Speaker of ihe House 
Newt Gingrich's desire to reopen 
orphanages. If you feel like a 
faceless number here on campus 
or at your job. try growing up 
wilh that same feeling. If that 
Idea is not a step backward, I'm 
not sure what is. 

We have to continue our sup- 
port for Bill Clinton. In two 
years, we should re-elect him a 
strong supportive staff of 
Democrats who will help him 
help us. The problem with gov- 
ernment is not the people we 
elect, it's the people we don't 
elect by not voting.

Dear Editor 

I am not writing to complain 
about something Mark King did oi 
some ad that was run in the paper 
and people didn't like, but I am 
writing to voice my opinion and 
feelings about a professor here at 
IPFW. 

In the fall of 1992, 1 began here 
pan-time. That fall, and again in 
the spring of 1993, 1 had a profes- 
sor by the name of Rheba Knox. 
The two semesters I bad her were 
the best I've ever had. In those 
two semesters Ms. Knox brought 
more alive in me than any other 
teacher ever had, including grade 
school and high school. It's a sad 
thing to admit, but when I first 
started attending IPFW all I want- 
ed was to get my degree and get it 
over with. But crossing paths wilh 
Ms. Knox has changed that. 

AH my life, when it came to 
my education, I have always been 
one to sit quieL listen, and not ask 
questions about something I didn't 
understand or question something 
a teacher has said. In other words, 



I have been a passive learner and 
accepted whatever the teacher said 
as the whole truth and nothing but. 
I am happy to say that is no longer 
so. Ms. Knox has a way of teach- 
ing that can draw anyone to speak 
out. whether it is for or against 
something. She can slir something 
inside students to the point that 
they can no longer sit passively 
and accept things as being just the 
way they are. Instead, from my 
own experience, they will become 
active learners (gelling an educa- 
tion, not just a degree) and be 
filled with enthusiasm and passion 
for whatever il is they chose to do 
with their lives. Also they will 
probably feel, like I do, that ihey 
really are worth something and 
can make a difference in this 
world. 

I did nol see Ms. Knox the fall 
of 1994 due to the birth of my sec- 
ond son. But when I relumed in 
spring of 1994. 1 did look her up. 
As usual, Ms. Knox took the lime 
to chat and treated me like an 
equal, not just another student. At 



the beginning of this semester I 
tried to look her up again and, lo 
my dismay, could not locate her. I 
was deeply saddened by the 
thought that she was no longer 
teaching here. Then, by chance, I 
ran into her recendy. We chatted 
for a while and she informed me 
she did not know her fate for next 
semester. 

Therefore, I am voicing my 
opinion or at least my thoughts. 1 
truly feel that the students here at 
IPFW would be losing out tremen- 
dously if Ms. Knox were to be let 
go. She has so much to offer and 
give. I have received so much 
more from her than many other 
professors here. Ms. Knox has 
truly been an inspiration in my life 
and can be for so many other stu- 
dents. I urge IPFW to keep Ms. 
Knox on staff so that many other 
students can be touched by her as 
I have been. 

Sincerely, 

Stephanie Kahrhoff

Jesm said Adam and Steve 

Immoral 

To the Editor 

I am compelled to respond to a 
letter published in the Dec. 1. 1994 
edition of The Communicator writ- 
ten by Joyce A. Stevens, titled 
"Gays, lesbians need protection in 
the workplace." I want to begin by 
saying that I agree that there is no 
call for discrimination or harass- 
ment in the workplace or anywhere 
else based on one's sexual prefer- 
ence, religious beliefs, race or 
social status. However, as worthy a 



subject as this is, Stevens does not 
stay on the subject and wanders off 
to make several erroneous and con- 
fusing statements in regards to the 
"Tightness" and "wrongness" of 
homosexuality itself. There are (wo 
statements I would like to comment 
on. 

The first statement I want to 
address reads as follows: the Bible 
Is not so clear on this subject 
[homosexuality] as some people 
seem to think, and Jesus said not 
one word about it." First of all, it is 
true that while Jesus was here on 



this earth, he never addressed the 
issue of homosexuality. The sexual 
issues he addressed were those con- 
cerning the love between one man 
and one woman, marriage and fam- 
ily, and divorce. The omission of 
any discussion on homosexuality is 
significant, 1 believe, because it 
indicates that homosexuality is not 
a negotiable issue. Jesus gave 
teachings on the managing of fami- 
ly relationships between a husband 
and wife and between parents and 
their children because these were 
important. There were no family 



relationship issues to discuss in the 
"marriage" of two gays or lesbians, 
became according to Biblical tradi- 
tion that is not a family. In response 
to the first pan of Stevens' state- 
ment, the Bible is very clear about 
homosexual relations. Leviticus 18 : 22 
clearly states "Do not lie with a 
man as one lies with a woman: that 
is detestable." I believe that this 
verse silenced any controversy, and 
so there was no need for Jesus to go 
into it while he was here. 

The other statement from this 
article I would like to discuss is 



"Eve and her partner arc having lots 
of kids, and Adam and Steve arc, 
too." I do not know where this fits 
in to the writer's call for protecting 
gays in the workplace, but I would 
still like to comment on it. In addi- 
tion to not fitting into the thought 
process of the article, the statement 
itself is rather confusing and some- 
what disturbing. Is the writer trying 



to suggest that "Adam" and "Steve" 
arc capable of creating new life 
together? I sincerely hope that this 
is not the case. If, however, this is 
what Stevens believes, maybe the 
elementary schools' new sex educa- 
tion programs have not been as suc- 
cessful as once hoped.

State mandated prayer Is not the 

answer 

To the Editor: 

With regard to The 
Communicator's Dec. 8 staff edito- 
rial, I agree that there are problems 
afflicting the public school system, 
as well as society in general, but I 
do not believe thai The 
Communicalor isolated a way to 
resolve problems through the points 
it attempted to make. 

In its pitch for state-organized 
and-enforced public school prayer, 
the editorial noted that "God has 
many names: Allah, Immanuel, 
Jehovah or simply higher power." 
To that list one could add Krishna, 
Goddess, the Great Spirit, or innu- 
merable other misunderstandings of 
deities or spirituality found among 
ahimists, Buddhists, Parsis, Jains, 
Taoists, Shintoists, Western Neo- 
Pagans. and many others. Lest we 
forget, there are also agnostics, 
who don't presume to know 
whether or not there arc deities, and 
atheists who disbelieve the exis- 
tence of deities. 



The United states has always bad a 
diversity of religions, sects, and 
freethinkers. To avoid impinging 
upon their rights to believe as they 
chose, the architects of this republic 
chucked the European tradition of 
official state religions. Ever since. 
the First Amendment's first words 
("Congress shall make no law 
respecting as establishment of reli- 
gion, or prohibiting the free exer- 
cise thereof. . . ") have been the 
focus of numerous battles in courts 
and legislatures concerning how 
they should be applied. In the case 
of the public school system, which 
didn't exist when the First 
Amendment was written, the U.S. 
Supreme Court ultimately deter- 
mined that the government has no 
business forcing puouc school stu- 
dents to pray; therefore, kids in 
public schools are free to retain per- 
sonal beliefs in practices their par- 
ents raised them in without interfer- 
ence from the state. 

The reason for this restriction on 
government power is easily under- 
standable. There is no all-purpose 



religion which the public as a whole 
would readily adopt if the state 
shoved it down their throats; such 
an action would violate a funda- 
mental right. 

It is thus ironic thai The 
Communicator editorialized in 
favor of the slate coercing the pub- 
lic into religious conformity, mere 
inches above the paper's pluralistic 
mission statement. The 
Communicator concluded that com- 
promises like "a moment of 
silence" in public classrooms 
wouldn't suffice — rather, the stale 
should mandate that public school 
students pray in a manner that the 
stale has determined prayers should 
be prayed. 

The Communicator also dishon- 
estly Iramed the issue ot govern- 
ment religious interference as a pro 
school prayer/anti-social prayer 
debate. No law prevents public 
school students from silently pray- 
ing at any given moment during the 
school day, and there are plenty of 
options available for students who 
wanl to pray vocally in collective 



Mysterious Females: 

Women enjoy playing with men's 

minds 

To the Editor 

The topic I wish to discuss is 
women. Now before I begin, I wish 
to state that I have the utmost 
respect for the feminine race. Not 
only because I fear for my life/but' 
because I feel' (hat women should be 
treated with the respect and equality 
lhat they so deserve. I just have one 
question: Why are they so mysteri- 
ous? 

I am a male and, like every oilier 
male on Ihis planet, I would be for- 
ever happy if 1 knew this answer. Il 
would make life so much easier and 
happier if men and women could 
communicate clearly while in their 
early high school/college days. The 
word communication is a key factor. 
It is my opinion that men and 
women have a hard time communi- 
cating with each other. The ladies of 
this day and age make it into a 
game. They love to send hidden 
messages to some poor guy that he 
has no chance of decoding. For 
example, let us discuss dating. If a 
lady is interested or even partially 
interested in a man, she will not 
come out and say it. She, instead, 
begins to play her game. A certain 
way she cats, sits, talks, dresses, 
walks or uses body language is sup-

I Reduce, 
Recycle 



posed to say lo the guy, "I am inter- 
ested." These so-called obvious 
clues are so slight and insufficient, 
only the subconscious mind is able 
to detect them. By (he time a guy's 
brain is able lo realize what is hap- 
pening, it is too lale to do anything 
about i(. All this does is bring a 
man's ego down',' for he realizes he 
has missed an opportunity of a pos- 
sible relationship. 

Women get a kick out of playing 
with a guy's mind. They say, "Well, 
what fun would it be if we didn't." 1 
just cannot understand if they are 
interested in a guy and want to 
spend more time with him, why they 
cannot say so instead of risking the 
possibility of the man not detecting 
what the brainwashing tactic is sup- 
posed lo mean. 

I have often wondered why 
women go to the bathroom in 
hordes. One cannot go alone, bui has 
to be accompanied by a fellow 



female. I know the answer; It is to 
plan further brainwashing tactics to 
use on their dates. A plan of action 
is discussed in the "meeting place" 
and is carried out when the ladies 
return. 

Now I am not saying males are the 
perfect beings of the world. One 
could write a book'oh all'of our bad 
characteristics. Bui ho' one can deny 
that women are the most mysterious

Bellarmine College 
Sweeps IPFW in 
conference openers 



By S. Brant Kclley 
Editor-ln-ChJer 

Both the IPFW men's and 

women's basketball learns traveled to 
Bellarmine College for a conference 
double-header at Knights' Hall in 
Louisville on Dec 29. 

The Lady "Dons began their con- 
ference season on a dark nolc against 
the Lady Knights. IPFW's defense 
and ball control gave way in the sec- 
ond half as Bellarmine clobbered the 
Lady 'Dons 94-72. 

IPFW came back in die first half 
after trailing by double figures and 
was down by two, 37-35. at half- 
time However, the Lady 'Dons only 
hit 14-of-37 field goals in the second 
half for 37 percent and BC ran off 55 
points for the half to carry the game 
away. 

IPFW coach Bowden said the 
Lady 'Dons did not play good post 
defense and could not stop BC's 
inside gome. She said BC stopped 
IPFW's fast break offense effective- 
ly- 
Junior guard Lindy Jones scored 
18 points and forward Dottie Porch 
added 13 on 6-of-12 field-goal shoot- 
ing. Tara Muzzillo came off the 
bench to grab eight rebounds and 
score eight points for Ihc Lady 'Dons. 
The Lady Knights placed ten play- 
era in the scoring column, and shot 
over 50 percent from the field. Cathy 
Brawner led five dou&amp;Ic- figure scor- 
ers for the Knights with 19 points. 
Molly Nichaus scored 16 and hauled 
in a game-high 10 rebounds. 

The Lady 'Dons only shot eight 
free-throws during the game and lost 
the ball 23 times. BC shot 21 from 
the charity stripe. The one bright spot 
for IPFW was reflected on the glass; 
the Lady 'Dons outrebounded BC by 
IS, 13 on the offensive boards. 



The BC men's squad barely com- 
pleted the sweep two hours later, 86- 
83. IPFW coach Andy Piazza gave 
eight players double-figure minutes 
in a hotly contested battle throughout. 

The Knights were led by sopho- 
more forward Steve Mercer with a 
game-high 28 points on 10-of-16 
field-goal shooting. He could have 
scored more if he hod shot better than 
8-17 from the free-throw line. Dave 
Naber and Shannon Phillips added 17 
and 15 points, respectively. 

Steve Sanders led IPFW with 19 
points on 9-of-12 field-goal shooting. 
Kyle Kirby added 15 points to go 
with 10 rebounds. IPFW shot 58 per- 
cent from the field. 

Bellarmine relied heavily on the 
three-point shot, hitting 9-of-17 for 
the game. The Knights also kept the 
ball well; they only had 1 1

respectively. IUPUI hit 58 percent of 
its field- goal attempts. 

IPFW placed only one player in 
double figures, T.J. Hollowell. The 
bulk of his 16 points came on 4-of-5 
shooting from beyond the 3-point 
stripe. The Mastodons shot 37 per- 
cent from the field. 

The Metros jumped out to an early 
lead against the 'Dons and walked 
into the locker room at halftime with 
a 52-32 advantage. Both teams 
returned in the second more precise 
than in the first. IUPUI shot 64 per- 
cent in the second half, while IPFW 
shot 44 percent; the 'Dons hit 32 per- 
cent of their field-goal attempts in the 
first half. 



The 'Dons' did place ten players 
into the scoring column, but their 

biggest problem was ball handling; 
IPFW turned the ball over 28 times.
