Tom Scott to 
leave IU-PU 



By MARK FRANKE 

Thomas K. Scott, business mana- 
ger of Purdue here, has resigned 
effective January 2, 1974. He will 
move to Bryant College in Smithfield, 
R.I., where he will become vice-presi- 
dent for business affairs. 

His resignation has prompted 
speculation as to when and by whom 
he will be replaced. One possibility 
which has been suggested is that no 
permanent replacement will be 
named until the new super-chancellor 
takes office, at which time a single 
IU-PU business manager will be 
appointed. 

Scott has been the Purdue 
Business Manager for approximately 
six years. Prior to his coming to 
IU-PU, he was business represent- 
ative for the Department of Biology in 
Purdue University in West Lafayette. 

As Purdue Business Manager, 
Scott was responsible for the tradi- 
tional business functions, such as 
accounting and the bursar's office. 
But he also supervised maintenance, 
safety and security, utilities, purchas- 
ing, personnel, and general services. 

He also was accountable for the 
student activity fee and parking fee 



In 






manager, Scott reported directly to 
the Director of Regional Campus 
Business Affairs in West Lafayette 
and not to the Purdue Dean and 
Director here. This line of command 
was the cause of many problems 
during Scott's tenure here. 

The super-chancellor agreement 
will place the new single business 
manager under the chancellor, elim- 
inating this past source of irritation. 

One IU-PU staff member has 
suggested that a temporary or acting 
business manager will be named to 
serve during the interim period 
before the super-chancellor is select- 
ed. At that time a new "super-busi- 
ness manager" will be appointed by

Will the faculty unify into one? 
Will IU-PU have a single common 
curriculum? Will the mission determ- 
ination agreement be modified or 
rescinded? 

These and other questions have 
been on the minds of many IU-PU 
faculty members since the announce- 
ment of the super-chancellor agree- 
ment, but there appears to be no 
definite consensus among the profes- 
sors on campus. 

One professor who is optimistic 
that these goals can be reached is Dr. 
James M. Berry, associate professor 
ofmanagement. "We can unite as one 
faculty with a single set of compli- 
mentary objectives," said Berry. 

Dr. Berry thought that there is 



evolving a unity of purpose among the 
local faculty which will result in a 
"positive synergy," in which the 
whole is greater than the sum of the 
individual parts. 

"They have cracked the ice," 
Berry commented on the recent 
presidential agreement. "They have 
held out the carrot and the faculty will 
nibble at it." 

Dr. Berry feels that this common 
purpose will cause an integration of 
the I.U. and Purdue curriculums into 
a common Fort Wayne curriculum. 
He added that will most likely 
produce a breakdown in the mision 
assignments. When asked about 
i campus opposition t 



Senate forms 
administrative 
stud/ committee 



By REX PUTT 

Documents establishing a search 
and screen committee which will 
have the responsibility of helping to 
thoose the super-chancellor, and an 
ad hoc joint steering committee which 
will confront the problems of adminis- 
trative realignment of the Fort 
Wayne campus were passed by the 
Purdue Fort Wayne Faculty Senate in 
their fourth meeting of the year, 
November 15, 1973, in Kettler Hall. 

These documents, 73-6 and 73-7, 
were presented by Dr. Clifford A. 
Nault, Jr. Both were initiated as the 
result of the acceptance of the new 
super-chancellor post by both nstitu- 
tions on the Fort Wayne campus. 



The search and screen committee 
will be responsible for aiding the 
presidents and boards of both 
universities in filling the office of 
super-chancellor at Indiana-Purdue, 
Fort Wayne. 

The Purdue Fort Wayne Senate 
will have four P.U. faculty members 
and two P.U. students serving on the 
search and screen committee. 

The nominating committee of the 
Purdue Fort Wayne Senate will 
conduct an election to determine the 
choice of four Purdue faculty mem- 
bers. They will be directly elected by 
the PUFW faculty. 

Nominations will be solicited by 
mail. Each nomination must contain 
the signatures of the nominee and at 



The election results will be 
reported to the faculty and the 
president of Purdue University 
through the office of the dean and 
director at Fort Wayne on or before 
December 7, 1973. 

Professor Raymond S. Wilkes 
also added the resolution that there 
should be a short biography of each 
nominee for the committee. 

The purpose of the ad hoc Joint 
Steering Committee is to recommend 
to the two Fort Wayne Faculty 
Senates the implementation of item 
No. 6 of the November 8, 1973 
document, as approved by the Board 
of Trustees, announcing administra- 
tive realignment of the Fort Wayne 
campus. 



The seven faculty members 
composing the committee will be 
elected by the faculty from each 
institution, the Purdue Associate 
Dean for Academic Affairs, and the 
Indiana Dean of Faculty. There will 
be one joint chairperson elected by 
each institution. There will also be 
one student representative from each 
institution, elected by the Student 
Senate of IU-PU. 



The responsibilities of the Steer- 
ing Committee will be: 1) To conduct 
■j|jen hearings designed to develop a 
list of problems involved in eventual 
merger of the two universities at Fort 
Wayne. 2) To develop proposals for 
resolution of problems; and to 
recommend to the Senates action to 
be taken by them in joint session, for 
alleviation of these problems. 



According to Dr. Berry, the kev to 
unification is the total efficiency that 
can be gained. He defines efficiency 
as budget efficiency, financial sav- 
ings resulting from the elimination of 
duplication, and people efficiency, the 
ratio of satisfaction to sacrifice. 
Berry said the increased budget 
efficiency would probably be offset by 
a decreased people efficiency because 
faculty would give more in sacrifice 
than they would gain in satisfaction. 



Berry admitted that there is a 
tendency of faculty members to 
identify with I.U. or Purdue, but he 
said the two faculties will attempt to 

"It will take a lot of courage by 
faculty," said Dr. Berry. But he is 
optimistic that unification will be 
attained. 

Much more pessimistic than 
Berry is Dr. David A. McCants, 
professor of 



"A general state of confusion or 
indecision will cause the faculty to 
move sluggishly," predicted Mc 
Cants. He thinks that the faculty will 
be reluctant to go very far. 

"The faculties are likely to 
remain two faculties until there is 
some evidence that the administra- 
tions at Lafayette and Blooming ton 
are willing to support a truly unified 
faculty. 

"I am pessimistic that Lafayette 
and Bloomington see that as a 



Although he agreed that a single 
Fort Wayne curriculum would be a 
proper goal and that the academic 
mission approach has outlived its 
usefullness. McCants ieels that sepa- 
rate faculties will assure the continu- 
ation of mission assignments and 
separate curriculums. 

He expects the faculty to investi- 
gate possible cooperative arrange- 
ments, but he does not foresee faculty 
unification as the outcome of these 
studies. 

According to McCants, much 
depends on the "willingness of people 



Falling somewhere between Ber- 
ry and McCants on the optimism 
spectrum is Franklin Kenworlhy, 
associate professor of theatre. "Chan- 
ges will come slowly and painfully, 
and they will be fought in Blooming- 
ton and Lafayette every inch of the 
way," said Kenworthy. 

According to Kenworthy, the 
faculty must keep in mind the mission 
of IU-PU, to serve the academic 
needs of northeastern Indiana. "We 
must look for what is best to serve 
students," said Kenworlhy. He added 
that Bloomington and Lafayette are 
not that concerned with the unique 
needs of the Fort Wayne Campus, and 
they will make the process of change 

Kenworthy feels that a joint 
faculty interface committee should 
begin work right away, and that a 
single Fort Wayne curriculum "must 



To accomplish this, Kenworthy 
said that the faculty must rid itself of 
what he calls the three p's: personal 
petty paranoia.

will come. 

"The faculty will do it," predicted 
Henderson. He expects "things to be 
standardized" and a "crossing uf the 
lines" to mix the best of both systems 
into unique IU-PU system. 

"The system will have to be 
unique to Fort Wayne, and that is 
where I am pessimistic," said 
Henderson, citing obstacles in Ulooin- 
ington and Lafayette to justify his 
feelings. 

Dr. Henderson does not think that 
the present academic mission align- 
ment can be altered or abolished. He 
feels that opposition from the main 
campuses, especially Lafayette, 
would hinder any significant change 
in this area. 

He did feel, however, that a Fort 
Wayne curriculum was necessary and 
would be developed. "That is the key.

going on sale. 

The University Singers received $4,750 of student activity money 
from the Student' Senate for this year. Even though this does not 
represent the entire Singers budget, it is a substantial amount. 

With the student body providing financial support for this 
organization, it is only logical to assume that students would receive 
priority for Dickens tickels Unfortunately, this is not the case. 

A student activity card holder should receive first opportunity at 
purchasing tickets, and should be able to buy them at a reduced price. 

However, students must pay the same price as non-activity card 
holders. Secondly, they receive no priority in purchasing. Most publicity 
about the dinner is directed away from the students and to the 
community. 

The director of the Singers is obviously concerned about reaching the 
general public and not the student body. But it is a safe bet that the 
Singers will be back for more money next budget session. 

It is the responsibility of the Student Senate to insure their 
investment in this activity, if the student body is ignored by the activity, 
it is hardly fair to expect continued student financial support. This 
decision will have to be made by the Student Senate. 

Athletic apathy again 

The Indiana-Purdue athletic teams again this year are suffering 
from lack of student support. In the past, poor performances by the teams 
made it difficult to support them. However, the teams are no longer 
automatic losers. 

Most of the teams at Indiana-Purdue are definitely improving, 
illustrated by the fine record of this year's tennis team and the records of 
the golf and" baseball teams last spring. But the lack of support for the 
athletic program at IU-PU still exists. 

The three most common arguments given for not supporting the 
Mastodon teams are 1) Indiana-Purdue is a regional campus and a 
commuter college. Who wants to get involved in student activities for this 
type of university? 2) IU-PU doesn't have a gymnasium or tennis courts. 
Who wants to run all over town to find out where they are playing? 31 All 
of the Indiana-Purdue teams are terrible. Who wants to watch losers? 

All of these arguments are somewhat truthful, but less than one 
might think. UCLA, perhaps the best-known university in the country, 
gained its fame through its athletic program. UCLA is a regional campus 
of the University of California. A commuter campus actually gives the 
students a better chance to follow the athletic teams because the majority 
of the students have their own cars and live in the university area. 

It's true that the Mastodons don't have their own gymnasium and 
: tennis courts, but they do have their own soccer field and baseball 
diamonds. The basketball home games are played at the old Central High 
School gym, which is strategically located in the center of Fort Wayne. 
Weather sometimes poses a problem for the outdoor sports, but 
basketball is played in a warm and comfortable gymnasium. 

The 1973 IU-PU tennis team effectively disproved the third 
argument. A team with an B-4 record is hardly a loser, and the golf and 
baseball teams traditionally have been among the best for small colleges 
in the state. 

Many of the IU-PU teams are still struggling. Nobody likes a loser. 
But it has become quite difficult to expect a winner at Indiana-Purdue, 
because nobody gives a damn. 

A CHANGING WORLD 



By D. 11. ZEHNER 

Every day of the year under rainy 
skies or sunshine, ordinary Ameri- 
cans and visitors Irom overseas come 
by the hundreds to a hillside in 
Arlington lo visit the grave of John F. 
Kennedy. 

But among the intellectuals, it is 
open season on Kennedy. The old men 
of the establishment and the young 
men of the new revisionism agree that 
his reputation as a presidei 



indictment, which deserves careful 

Kennedy, it is said, set the pattern 
of the kind of foreign policy carried 
out by Lyndon Johnson with all its 
disastrous diversive consequences 
here at home. Furthermore, it was 
Kennedy appointees-Rusk, Mc- 
Namara, the Bundys-who carried out 
that foreign policy. More broadly 
speaking, Kennedy's soaring rhetoric 
and ambiliou- policies intensified the 
globalism, the image of America as 
the world's policeman and social 
worker, which is so out of fashion 

A passage is often cited from 
Kennedy's inaugural address, "Let 
every nation know whether it wishes 
us well or ill. that we shall pay any 
price, oppose any foe lo assure the 
survival and the success of liberty " 

But who is to say that John 
Kennedy would have deemed a major 
land war in South Vietnam, necessary 
"to assure the survival of liberty'"' 
Lyndon Johnson made that decision in 
1965, some fifteen months after 
Kennedy was in his grave. 

No one forced Johnson to make 
that decision. He entered office 
convinced that Vietnam was worth 
fighting for and he acted upon his own 
convictions. It is absurd to picture 
him in foreign affairs as the ignorant 
puppet of his dead predecessor's 
policies. When it suited him, Johnson 
changed them. Immediately upon 
taking office, he placed Thomas Mann 
in charge of both the Alliance for 
Progress program and of all Latin- 
American affairs and rapidly 
changed both the tone and direction of 
Kennedy policies in the hemisphere. 

But what about Rusk, Mc- 
Namara, the Bundys? In assuming 
that Kennedy would have followed 
their Vietnam advice as Johnson did. 
critics conveniently forget that at his 
death, Kennedy was disenchanted 
with Rusk, and planned to replace 
him after the 1964 elections. More 
important they ignored the departure 
of the two men who were Kennedy's 
most trusted consulors in foreign as 
well as domestic affairs-Robert 
Kennedv and Theodore Sorensen. 

Kennedy had planned to visit 
Japan and Russia in the spring of 
1964. He also had major initiatives in 
foreign policy in mind for his second 



tted 
small corner of Southeast Asia. 

Yet what Kennedy would have 
done in Vietnam if he had lived, no 
man can say. What can be said, 
however, is that had he intervened 
massively and found the war was 
going badly, he would not have dug 
his heels into wet concrete and stood 
fast and become entrenched while his 
party and his country blew up around 
him. Kennedy was much too sensitive 



" The only 1 i me Kennedy used force 
was at the Bay of Pigs. When the raid 
miscarried, he chose the embarrass- 
ment of withdrawal rather than try to 
cover his mistake with air strikes and 
Marine Corps reinforcements. 
Throughout his administration, 
whether he was dealing with Con- 
gress, Khrushchev, with bigoted 
southern governors, or steel company 
executives, Kennedy followed a 
consistent pattern of trying to narrow 
differences, to conciliate rather than 
confront, to seek face saving com- 
promises. 

When he was alive, liberals 
criticized him because he was not 
agressive enough in fighting his 
adversaries in Congress Cold war- 
riors criticized him for selling wheat 
to Russia, for not bombing Russian 
missile bases in Cuba, for making an 
unenforceable settlement in Laos in 
1962, for taking too big a risk in 
signing the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty 
They recognized him for what he 
was-a peace maker. 

Kennedy was an intellectually 
gifted man and the most skillful 
national politician of his day. He had 
his weaknesses and made his mis- 
takes, but when death cut him off, he 
was on his way to becoming a great 
man and a great president. The 
crowds who wind their way to his 
grave site are not mistaken in their 
admiration.

President needs 'deputy presidents' 



By JOHN PINKIKMW 



The troubles besetting the nation 
under President Nixon lend support to 
to the often expressed views of 
scholars and political science experts 
that the presidency of the United 
Slates is ,.o bic a job for one man. 
And, while Wait^,.'- and other 
assorted misdeeds in and around the 
White House dramatize the current 
crisis, the overwhelming burden of 
the country's top job would exist 
without these tragic disgraces. 



IN 






that what we need is something n 
than piecemeal amendment of the 

federal Constitution - a comprehen- 
sive revision as city charters and 
e revised to put 



One direction such a revision 
might take would be to provide for 
two "deputy presidents" or two 
"premiers" or similar positions that 
would take unwanted loads off the 
president without interfering with the 
succession of the vice president to the 
highest office in case of death or 
disqualification of the president. 

Mr. Nixon's problems, other than 
those associated with Watergate, 
tapes, dirty tricks, etc., would seem to 
indicate that he might welcome such 
a rearrangement of the government. 
One of the "deputy presidents" might 
be a czar on externa) affairs, much as 
Henry Kissinger was even when he 
was not secretary of state. The other 
"Deputy" or "premier" would be for 
internal affairs. 



President Nixon has had signifi- somewhat comparable 



n foreign affairs and 
it is unfortunate that these achieve- 
ments have been lost in Watergate- 
and in domestic problems for which 
he has no appetite. 

He always has loved the global 
scene as an arena of operations and 
Kissinger was a fitting deputy for him 
in Uiis field However, he has had no 
"Kissinger" for domestic affairs. If 
he had he might have escaped many 



An example is inflation. Despite 
the "horrors" of Watergate, etc., as 
once Atty. Gen. John Mitchell called 
them, samplings of American opinion 
have shown that the down-to-earth 
citizen is more bugged by the cost of 
living than by Watergate. Mr. Nixon 
has shown far less interest in slowing 
the rising cost of groceries and other 
family needs than in, with Kissinger's 



Also, the problem of oil, electric- 
ity and all energy shortages has been 
looming for a long time. Copley News 
Service's Frank Macomber has been 
writing warnings in this news area for 

For a long time he could not 
interest editors in printing his stories, 
let alone interest the President in 
attacking the problem. A domestic 
"Kissinger" might have done much of 
Mr. Nixon's dirty work in these 



President. 

Under the concept of two "deputy 
presidents," each would be in direct 
and full control of appropriate cabinet 
officers and responsible to the 
president and the Congn 



in the Pentagon, with service 
; responsible to the secre- 
tary of defense, who in turn has the 
ear of the president. Lots of generals 
and admirals do not like the system, 
but it does function with reasonable 
efficiency. 



f divided ii 
need for mo 
minor interest. 

Predecessor Lyndon B. Johnson 
was skillful in twisting the arm of 
Congress and in pushing through 
domestic programs like civil rights, 
help for the aged and other vital social 
improvements. But, he was a failure 
in foreign affairs just as Mr Nixon 
was a success in the area of Mr. 
Johnson's greatest frustration-end- 
ing the Vietnam war. 



The late President John F. 
Kennedy didn't have time to establish 
a record, other than the fiasco of the 
Bay of Pigs, and President Dwight 
Eisenhower, with an efficiently funct- 
ioning staff, seemed to be able to 
handle both external and internal 
crises - thwarting the Soviet Union in 
the Middle East (Lebanon) and 
crushing rebellious Gov. Orval 
Faubus of Arkansas when he defied 
the Supreme Court on civil rights. 

However, an Eisenhower doesn't 
come along every day, and the nation 
needs help far beyond consideration 
of resignation or impeachment of Mr. 

Some form of domestic and 
foreign affairs "deputy presidents" 
might be the answer - because the 
current problems of the presidency 
show increasingly that the job is too 
much for one man in this complex and 
fast-moving world of the 1970s. 



Staffer condemns review 



To the Editor: 

Now that Impressions has been 
baptized by the fire of popular 
tongues, we can safely assume it to 
be, in fact, a litery (sic) magazine. It 
is not the first time that writers have 
been denounced by those who control 
the press of mass communications. 
After such a review as that given by 
the Communicator, one is tempted to 
declare this campus to be a cultural 
desert. Indeed, if the perceptions of 
our entire audience are as sterile as 
those of Mrs. Franke, then this 
campus will never be able to sustain 



tongue and the Communicator only 
one organ of popular opinion. Other 
have expressed their satisfaction with 
the magazine and have offered their 
support, which will show in forthcom- 
ing issues. 

It is enough for individuals of the 
audience to simply say, "It is good, 1 
like it." But for the would-be critic, 
that is not enough. The critic is 
obligated to focus attention on the 
elements that comprise a work of art 
and to say how they work, or if they 
don't and why not. That means that 
the critic must acquire experience, 
must become aware of all the various 
styles and conventions that mold art, 
must maintain an open mind with 
respect to unfamiliar forms. Personal 



When the Impressions' staff 
suggested to the Communicator that 
they write a review of the first issue, 
we expected an honest appraisal of 
the contents ; a preview for the 
audience of what the magazine 
contained. Instead, Mrs. Franke 
mentioned only three poems and 
lumped all the rest together as trash. 
She didnt even mention the three good 
poems by title, let alone give a hint as 
to content. Nor did she attempt to 
define "literary trash." As a critic. 
she fails. But even if she found three 
poems that she liked, might we not 
say that she received an abundant 
share of what the magazine had to 

The bitter part is that being a 
college newspaper, the Communica- 
tor ought to rise above such low tricks 
as merely insinuating incompetence 
l the part of Impressions' staff. A 



would have discovered 1 



and then reported the facts instead of 
trying to make a story out of their own 
biased speculations As to responsible 
reporting, the Communicator fails.

Goal of Senate 
University welfare 

To the Editor: 

The Student Senate readily ad- 
mits that there are many problems 
that have not been resolved pertain- 
. ing to the University. Any and all 
students that have ideas or suggest- 
ions pertaining to the solutions of 
these problems should feel free to 
communicate with a Senator or any 
other member of the Students' 
Government. Furthermore, any 
concerned student who wishes not 
only to promote his ideas but to devote 
time to the instituting of his proposals 
will be more than welcome to become 
a part of Students' Government 
However, each student should re- 
member that his ideals should benefit 
the entire student body in that the 
welfare of the University, not 
personal gain, is the purpose of 
Students' Government.

By ARNOLD WERNER, M.D. 



s I stop the pressure. I have asked 

m.m\ friends if they have felt anything under similar 
conditions and they have all said no. What is the c 
if any, between navel and penis? 

ANSWER: Strange as it may seem there 

between the navel (umbilicus I and the tip of the penis. / 

e urologist friend who is fascinated by penili 

s gave valuable 
explanation for this phi 






producing a 
In the course of 
intrauterine development, there is a period of time when the 
bladder opens to the outside of the body through the same 
area that carries maternal blood vessels into the developing 
fetus. Eventually, this opening closes; the connection is 
called a urachus. Occasionally the urachus remains open, 
which can lead to loss of urine through the umbilicus, a 
condition which is almost invariably detected in early 
infancy. In other cases, there is no leakage but there is a 
connection between the navel and the bladder through the 
urachus. The pain in the end of the penis is because of 
pressure transmitted to the base of the bladder where the 
urethra ithe tube carrying urine out) originates. 

My colleague and I were both concerned lest we panic 
you into thinking you have a dangerous condition, yet, if our 
hypothesis is correct, then you are in need of medical 
attention. You are in need of a referral to a urologist which 
can be obtained from your regular physician, health service 
or county medical society. In the meantime, stop poking 
yourself. 

QUESTION: How do the eyedrops that get rid of blood shot 
eyes work? Do they bypass some natural protective 
function of the blood shot eye or is the blood shot eye a 
warning signal? The reason I ask this is because I like the 
way they helped my eyes when they were blood shot as a 
result of being stoned. Are there any precautions to be 
followed with eyedrops? 

ANSWER: The plain old ordinary eyedrops, which are 
commonly found in drug stores, are a waste of time and 
money. They contain nothing of value to the eye and their 
effects are largely psychological. The eyedrops that get the 
redness out do so because they contain an agent which 
constricts very tiny blood vessels which produce the 
appearance of redness. The use of such eye drops is 
probably harmless although they may cause irritation for 
some people, especially if used frequently. Their effect is 
fairly short lived. 

There are two dangers to the use of eyedrops that you 
should be aware of. Although all the eye drops I checked in 
the local apothecary contain a substance to discourage 
bacterial contamination, such contamination is still 
possible, and you could end up producing an infection by 
using the eyedrops. . Therefore, the end of the dropped 
bottle should never contact anything and the stuff should 
not be kept around for very long or used at all if it ever 
appears cloudy. The second caution is that not all cases of 
blood shot eyes are caused by being stoned. Sometimes the 
blood shot eye is a sign of infection. Self medicating an 
infected eye with over the counter eye drops is no better 
than trying to batter down brick walls with ping pong balls. 
Eyes are delicate and lovely things and deserve the very 
best of care. They should be taken to your doctor if there are 
any unusual symptoms involving them.

THE BIG SPORTS FARCE 

Who says there was a Big Ten Football Conference in 1973'' liidn t 
you know that the Big Ten was dissolved before the s 
favor of a new streamlined setup, the Gia 
Eight? 

Yes, Virginia, it's true. And did you know that the ever-powerful 
Purdue Riveters tied for second spot in the Puny Eight, evening their 
conference record at 4-4 with a thrilling, convincing 2tt-23 Iriumph over 
none other than those persisteni Hurryin' Hoosiers from Bioomington?

So look for a Rose Bowl entr;

Now let us ex 
schools. They all need to be examined. 

College students, stretch your memories back to that fateful day of 
November 24, 1973. The Giant Two got together at Ann Arbor in front or 
105,000 and grappled to a 10-10 deadlock. So the question was, who would 
go to the Rose Bowl? 

The Giant Two beslowed upon the athletic directors of the Puny Eight 
the task of deciding which of the unbeatens would go to Pasadena. 

Of course it should have been just a mere formality in announcing 
that the Michigan Wolverines were their unanimous choice. After all, 
Ohio State players had realized their big dreams of being able to 
participate in the great classic in 1972. They had represented the Giant 
Two well, but this year they surely would be pleased to allow their 
Michigan brothers to accept the coveted honor. 

Those damned corndog athletic directors sure hurl a lot of deserving 
people, didn't they? Readers, dig up a copy of The News-Sentinel from 
November 26, 1973. Find the sports section and take a look at the picture 
of Dennis Franklin, the Wolverines' able quarterback. 

He is watching a television announcer proclaim thai the Ohio State 
Buckeyes were voted the Rose Bowl entry again. Look closely at the 
picture. It doesn't show the tears. 

Oh. yes, the Puny Eight athletic directors had excuses. One 
reportedly said he thought it would be nice if, this year, the best Giant 
Two team in the first half would get the nod for the January 1 classic: 
Ohio State, 10-0. 

Another said he preferred Ohio Stale's school colors. And a third 
asserted that the crops have been below average this year. 

KOMETS FLYING HIGH 

Marc Boileau's Fort Wayne Komets are finally starting to jell again.

Last year college students could get a ticket at the door for a K's tilt 
for the student rate of SI. 50. This year it's likely the same. The brand of 
hockey is great, making this type of entertainment an excellent value. 

Attendance at the coliseum has been good but not nearly what it 
should be. The average turnout must be around 4,500 and it should be 
7,000. 

This writer thought things were going better when, upon passing the 
coliseum at 7:30 p.m. last Friday night, the parking lot was already 
jammed. 1 couldn't believe it. .until 1 saw the sign in front of the building:

Troubadors rally for win 



and rallied lo defeat the Indiana- 
Purdue Mastodons, 79-67 in the first 
game of the City College Tournament 
al Indiana Tech. 

St. Francis used accurate shoot- 
ing and aggressive hustle in subduing 
the Mastodons. Charles King led all 
scorers with 19, while Jerry Delong, 
the most valuable player of the 
tournament, added 1G. Barry Light 
and Mike Hannan tallied 12 apiece for 
the Troubadours. 

Indiana-Purdue jumped out 
quickly, tearing apart the St. Francis 
zone defense with fabulous shooting 
and artistic manuevering. Dean and 
Rex Putt led the early surge that 
enabled the Mastodons to post an 
early 21-8 lead. However, although it 
took St. Francis over 8 minutes to 
score, the Troubadours fought back 
fiercely behind the outstanding shoot- 
ing of Charles King and the strong 
board work of Jerry Delong to tie the 
Mastodons at 28. The half ended with 
the score knotted at 35. 

The St. Francis five came out 
with hot hands in the second half and 
quickly took an eight-point lead. The 
maintained the lead until there were 
about seven minutes to go, when the 
Mastodons rallied back into conten- 
tion. With the help of several key 
interceptions the Mastodons tied the 
game at 61 with 5:38 remaining. The 
tie was short lived as St. Francis 
added 2 free throws and several quick 
baskets to again jump out into the

hosts completely submerged the 
visiting Mastodons. 

Gary Gray led all Mastodon 
scorers with 16 poinLs and Rex Putt 
was the only other man to hit double 
figures with 12. Carswell, Robbins, 
and Larson led the Anderson offense 
with 19, 18, and 18 points. They had 
five players in double figures. 

Anderson quickly jumped out into 
a 20-point lead in the second half, and 
their tenacious defense notably both- 



widened the lead to about 30 with ten 
minutes to go. The benches took over 
from there, and the final difference 
was increased considerably. 

The lack of experience of the 
Indiana-Purdue squad was noticeable 
in each of its first two games, but the 
fine first half showing by the 
Mastodons in the Anderson game 
indicates that they have the talent to 
be a winning team. Coach Wehrmeis- 
ter was very dissatisfied with the 
schedule arrangement. Marian and 
Anderson are two of the toughest 
teams in the state, and Indiana- 
Purdue had the dubious honor of 
playing in BOTH of their home 
openers. 



Second half buries IU-PU 

Anderson College withstood a 
first half scare by an inspired 
Indiana-Purdue team, and then ran 
the Mastodons out of the gym by a 
109-59 rout in a college basketball 
game at Anderson, November 20th. 

Anderson held only a 10-point 



Tall Marian cagers breeze 

The Indiana-Purdue Mastodons 
met more than they could handle in 
their opening game of the 1973-74 
basketball season on Saturday, Nov- 
ember 17. A tall Marian College team 
used a balance scorine attack to 
overwhelm the Fort Wayne squad

Three remain in football play 



By VINCE LOCHB1HLER 



The Indiana-Purdue cross coun- 
try team coached by Frank Chorba 
and assisted by Jim Gilbert and Jay 
Abromowitz completed its first sea- 
son in the history of the school with six 
victories and nine defeats. The 
Mastodons earned convincing victor- 
such opponents as

came to well-established opponents 
including Tri State, Depauw, Findlay, 
Marion, Greensville. Illinois, and

of its meets. The psychological 
disadvantage of running on unfamil-

procedure for the first year team. 

Athletes who received letters this 
year include sophomores David 
Heim, Mike Stieglitz, and David 
Hetrick, and freshmen Doug Vining, 
Roger Artherhults, Jim Steup, and 
Dan Green. 

Heim set the pace throughout the 
year for the Mastodons. He turned in

finishing a strong second. Stieglitz 
and Brad Kimmel established the 
best 6-mile relay time with a 33:52

stronger with returning lettermen. 
The team will also have home meets:

There was great support for the 
cross-country program from both 
students and faculty. Dr. Lloyd 
Smith, professor in construction-tech-

measuring the new course. Jim

In the key game of the day, 
Stoneface looked like the champs of

combined a tough defense with a 
potent offense to remain undefeated. 
Jon Werli and Mike Stratton supplied 
the offensive punch with touchdowns 
for the winners while a Mike Usina to 
Mark Pantello pass put six on the 
board for Smith. 

In the final game of the day, the 
Super Jocks upended the 73 Calt T s 13-0 
to remain in the running. Kevin Tonne 
and Doug Bedwell scored for the 
Super Jocks and the defense posted 
the shutout.

r Dan Grussing chipped in with 9 
and letterman Gary Trump added 8. 
Dave Peterson came off the bench to 
score S points also. 

Marian got off to a fast start, and 
used their fast break effectively to 
take an early 25-13 lead. A torrid fast 
break and accurate shooting helped 
them to increase their lead, while the 
Mastodons were having a difficult 
time finding the range. 

Gus Wade and Dave Apke led the 
Marian scoring with 21 and 18 point 
respectively. 



Mastodon rally falls short 

Indiana-Purdue lost its 4th game 
of the season, despite the accurate 
shooting of Dean Putt and an inspired 
second half comeback led by Rex 
Putt, in the city tournament consola- 
tion game against Bible College. The 
Falcons rolled to a 40-22 halftime 
lead, and managed to hang on for a 
86-75 victory, 

Bible College used a balanced 
attack, as they had 6 men scoring in 
double figures. Todd Habbeggar led 
the way with 18, while guard Larry 
Lewis contributed 15. 

Freshman Dean Putt led the 
Mastodon attack with 24 points. 
Brother Rex added 17 tallies, 15 
coming in the second half.

Cleaning stadium 
good profit job 



The job of cleaning the football 
stadium after games is contracted out 
to various student organizations at 
the U. of Oregon, The pay depends on 
crowd size and ranges up to about 
$1,500. 

All major athletic events are 
already booked for this year by 
organizations wanting the fund-rais- 
ing work. Often the big job, which 
usually entails 50 people working all 
day, is taken over by a minor athletic 
team needing the money for a trip or 
piece of equipment which is outside of 
their budget.

BITTER AND RESENTFUL 

"I'm very bitter and resentful," echoed Michigan coach Bo 
Schembechler after Ohio State was announced as the Big Ten 
representative to the Rose Bowl. The vote was conducted by the 
conference athletic directors on Sunday. 

This vote came as the result of a 10-10 tie between the two teams 
Saturday. The game saw OSU dominate the early stages of the contest 
and take a 10-0 halftime lead. But Schembechlers' men wanted the trip to 
Pasadena and turned the game around in round two. The result was the 
tie and the eventual disappointment. 

The reasons for the preference of Ohio State over Michigan were nev 
er explained by the A.D.'s— but the public knew. Woody Hayes said that it 
was because Michigan could only manage a tie on their home field. But 
Schembechler knew that it was because of the injury sustained by his 
number one QB, Dennis Franklin, late in the game. 

Schembech'er came out strong against the ruling and stated that he 
would be willing to accept any major bowl bid. This action is against Big 
Ten policy and would cause quite a controversy among the "topcats" on 
the board. But Michigan deserves a chance. 

As far as the quarterback situation is concerned, Michigan still has a 
"veteran" in Larry Cipa, who beat OSU in a big game two years ago. 
Personally, I can't see how he can do worse than the four incomplete 
passes thrown by the OSU signal-caller (which happened to be the only 
passes he threw all day). 

The Big Ten has gone a bit too far this time by denying Michigan a 
chance for the roses. USC has proven that it can stop the run, and so I 
predict the Trojans by 8. 1 would not be surprised if some of the Wolverine 
players would be rooting for USC.
