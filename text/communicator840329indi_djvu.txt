Magnavox gives $1,500

By GREG DAVIDSON

IPFW'b Phase III Cardiac Kthauililalion Program has received a (1,500 grant 
from Ihe Magnavox Government and Industrie I Electronics Corporation. 

The money was given in memory of Ihe late Arthur Jacobson. a Magnavox 
employee. The grant will be used lo finance the program's "crash cart," a cart 
packed with emergency oxygen, heart medications, and olher equipment The 
programuill begin April 16. 

Heart patients go through three stages of recovery from a heart attack. Priam- 1 
begins in the hospital and involves basic limb i 
oul m the hospital and requires the patient lod 
walking. Heart patients enter Phase III aller building themselves up from Phase 
II. This phase requires more strenuous exercise and the changing of bad eating 
and exercise habits Phase Iff takes plnccaKer a person has been discha rged from

Barbara Kidd, one of the coordinators of the program and heallh and training 
coordinator, said the program took more than a year to plan and propose lo the 
university and the Fort Wayne Medical Society. In order for the program to be 
accepted, two things were required. First, a medical director had to be found. 
Second, a physician musl be presenlduring the exercise sessions.

board, however, will be lucky to get 35 
eligible candidates on the ballot So why 
bother? 

Students' government has ac- 
complished a number ol things over the 
past academic year, such as increased 
parking and improved facilities In the 
athletic center These are just a couple 
ol things students' government ac- 
complished. Nothing would have been 
accomplished, however, without input 
from the student body. More, however, 
could nave been accomplished had more 



students gotten involved with students' 
government. 

Students' government is supposed to 
be representative of the entire student 
body, however, it can't be represen- 
tative if it doesn't have a full slate of 
candidates. The candidates won't need 
to campaign and the students would 
never get to know what a particular 
candidate stands for. 

At the present time, only one can- 
didate had completed a ballot for student 
body president The candidate, Don 
Gorney, a student senator, would win 
today without opposition. No one would 
need to vote, so why have an election. 
Gorney may be a worthy candidate, but applied
