New book details World War II history of Albania 



by Carrie Anne Leathers, 
News Editor 



Years of research and work have finally led lo the comple- 
tion of "Albania at War: 1939-45," a book wriiien by IPFW asso- 
ciate professor Bemd J. Fischer which examines the invasion of 
Albania by Fascist Italy and later occupation by Nazi Germany. 

"It look about ten years to put together because not much 



has been written on. this topic," Fischer said. 

Fischer will be presenting his new book at Little Professor 
bookstore on Saturday, Aug. 21, at 2 p.m. Fischer will explore 
the "forgotten theatre" of World War II and will also explore 
how historical events have led to today's situation in 
Yugoslavia. 

"Little wars are often overlooked, yet In (Albania) the 
human suffering was no less pitiful, the destruction no less dev- 
astating, the heroism no less laudatory, the treachery no less 
despicable, and the impact no less profound," Fischer said. 

Fischer is an internationally recognized expert on modem 



Balkan history and is also Vice President of the Society for 
Albanian Studies. He also serves as a member of the advisory 
board of the Albanian Studies Program at the School of 
Slavonic and East European Studies at the University of 
London. 

Fischer has also written another book, "King Zod and the 
Struggle for Stability in Albania," which deals with Albania's 
str^iggles in the 1920s and 1930s. 

Little Professor is located at 6360 W. Jefferson Blvd. in 
Covington Pla^u. 



Local law firm gives time and money 
to improve Lafayette park 



by CarrieAnne Leathers, 
News Editor 



After years of seeking funds 
for improvements, Lafayette Park 
in Fort Wayne was greatly 
improved through the assistance 
of the law firm of Baker &amp; 
Daniels. Employees of the law 
firm spent last Saturday 
installing new equipment and 
repairing old. 

"Everything went really well. 
It was a team 
building project 
for Baker &amp; 
Daniels and 
everybody was 
really excited at 
the end of the 
day," said Cheryl 
Couture, former 
president and 
current secretary 
of the Lafayette 
Esplanade 
Association. 

Baker &amp; 
Daniels donated 
a total of 
520,000 towards 
the park 
improvements, 
which included 
purchasing a new 
jungle gym to 
replace older 
equipment that 
was no longer 
safe to use. Although the law 
firm contributes to the commu- 
nity each year in some way, as 
many local businesses also do, 
this was the first time the firm 
donated physical labor to assist 
with a project. 

'We decided this opportuni- 
ty was something we really 
thought was important-improv- 
ing a park that needed work and 
is also heavily used," said Jon 
Bomberger, partner with Bakers 
&amp; Daniels, 

According to Couture, she 
began seeking money from the 
Parks and Recreation 
Department in order to improve 
the park, but the budget was 
already too full. It was not the 
first time that the Lafayette 
Esplanade Association had 
sought lo Improve the play- 
ground. 

Baker &amp; Daniels found out 
about the park's need for 



"It's like a dream 
come true to 
have the park 
improved and, 
without their 
generosity, it 
would not have 
happened." 
-Cheryl Couture of 
the Lafayette 
Esplanade 
Association 



improvemenL Couiure was con- 
tacted and informed that the law 
firm was interested in improving 
the park- 

"They added a conglomerate 
of slides, climbing areas and tun- 
nels that encompass develop- 
ment for children between ages 
2-12," Couture said. "It's like a 
dream come true to have the 
park improved and, without 
their generosity, it would not 
have happened." 

The final improvements to 
the park are likely to be com- 
plete by the end of the week, 
once the cement 
has dried firmly 
and woodchips 
have been laid. 

Area resi- 
dents are already 
enjoying parts of 
the improved 
playground and 
are looking for- 
ward to the final 
completion of 
the project. 

"When it's 
finished it's 
going to be 
great," said 

Antonio Licona, 
area resident 
who brings his 
son to the park. 

Baker &amp; 
Daniels also pro- 
vided an ice 
cream social for 
the area residents at the end of 
Saturday's work. 

Lafayette Park is 84 years 
old and director of the Fort 
Wayne Parks and Recreation 
Department Bob Arnold belie\es 
the park was a good choice to 
fix-up, 

"This particular park is a 

great choice by 

Baker &amp; HT 

Daniels ■'' 
because this 
neighborhood 
is solidi) 

behind the 
P

I d 



said. "When a 
whole neigh- 
borhood is 
behind a reha- 
bilitation, we 
know it will be 
a park that is 
well-used and 
well cared for."

Former IPSGA 
member plans 
broadcast for 
Campus Cable 56 

by CarrieAnne Leathers, 
News Editor 



As a result of IPFW student 
Daniel Westrick's interest in better 
informing students about IPSGA's 
activity, a new 
television 
show on 
College 56 
called "IPSGA 
Update" will 
be broadcast 
every two 
weeks, start- 
i n g in 
September. 

Weslrick 
decided to 
pursue the 
possibility of 
having the 
show since he 
no longer 
wanted to be 
involved 
directly with 
IPSGA or the 
Student 

Activities Board. It was Westrick's 
belief that information regarding 
IPSGA activities is not easy for stu- 
dents to find out. 

Last year, a show called Senate 
Profile aired on the College Cable 
Access channel. Its purpose was to 
let students learn more about the 
senators. 

"The show was a success for 
many people," Westrick wrote in his 
most recent letter to the editor. "The 
show (IPSGA Update) evolves from a 
profile to an informative show." 

The show will be hosted by Kim 
Rife. Westrick will be the ISPGA cor- 
respondent as well as the show's 
producer. 

"IPSGA Update will inform view- 
ers about what IPSGA is doing to bet- 
ter students' lives here at IPFW, talk 
with major players in IPSGA and at 
IPFWon their points of view, present 
roundtable discussion on the issues 
and explain how IPSGA works," 
Westrick wrote. 

Westrick is hoping for feedback 
once the show starts and anyone 
with comments or questions can 
write College 56. Westrick also 
invites those interested in helping 
with the show or commenting on the 
project to come to the College 56 
studios in Helmke Library to speak 
directly with turn.

SAB plans for fall semester 

Cedar Point trip marl&lt;s end of major summer events; 
more sctieduled for first weel&lt; of sctiool and fall semester 



by CarrieAnne Leathers, 
News Editor 



More than 65 people attended the 
Student Activities Board annual Cedar 
Point trip on July 21, filling two buses 
and making for a successful outing. 

"The trip was preity cool and a lot of 
people brought friends and family from 
outside the university," said Jence 
Johnson, director of Student Body 
Programming. 

No other activities are planned for 
the second summer session, however stu- 
dents and faculty can expect a lot of 
acti\it&gt;' the first week of school. Free food 
and entertainment will be available on 
campus throughout the week of August 



23 with more times available than in the 
past. 

"We are going to vary the times a lit- 
tle more than in past years so more peo- 
ple can come," said Johnson. "We are also 
trying to vary themes more for fall 
semester activities and reach a more 
diverse crowd." 

In the past, classes on Tuesdays and 
Thursdays directly conflicted with many 
SAB activities. 

"I think varying the times is really 
going to help students out," said Jim 
Corson, IPSGA vice-president. "In the 
past, students have told me they svould 
have gone to events if they had not had 
classes at that time." 

This year Johnson is hoping to keep 
SAB more in touch with students and 
var&gt;'ing the times and t&gt;pes of events is 



SAB'S first step in accomplishing this goal. 

"Doing this will show that we're try- 
ing to be more for the whole campus and 
not just working for students svho can 
come to events from noon to 1 p.m.," 
Johnson said. 

Popular comedian Marty Putz will 
also be returning to the campus to per- 
form during the first week of the fall 
semester. Putz is known for the peculiar 
theme to his shows. 

"I don't want to give away his show, 
but he does a lot with toilet paper and 
marshmallows," said Johnson. "Students 
around campus have requested his return 
since he last performed." 

Other events for the fall semester 
will include a return to the Jenny Jones 
show in Chicago, The Reactor, and Taste 
of Me.xico.

Local summer festivals are not open to everyone

WHAT WE THINK: Festivals are a great part o( a 
summer in Fort Wayne. Why the beertenis? 

WHAT DO YOU THINK? Send your e-mail response 
to stupaper© holmes, jplw.edu or a letter lo Walb 21 5. 




Elephant ears, cheese 
fries, candied apples and 
lemon shake-ups are some of 
the foods present at the Three 
Rivers Festival. German Fest 
has sausages and the Rib Fest 
has well, you guessed it, ribs. 

Each festival has different 
types of foods and beverages. 
However, one beverage that 
the events have in common is 
beer. Ever&gt;' evening, the beer 
tent is packed with patrons 
and a band. The streets are 
packed with people and 
police. 

The beer tent apparently 
is a huge attraction in this 
town. Why? During the day it 
is a sparsely populated area 
that lakes up a lot of space 
which could be used for some 
other activity. In addition to 
the beer tent, the food stands 
are open and there is a musi- 
cian, but not much else. 

Besides the lack of activi- 
ties that occur dunng the day 
in the main area of the festi- 
vals, the beer is extremely 
over-priced. The heat has 
been up to almost 100 
degrees, yet the people of this 
town continue to thrive at 
night in the beer tent. 

The idea of drinking beer 
in the open air instead of in a 
smoky bar may appeal to 
some individuals. 

We also believe that the 
bands attract many people. 
Throughout the summer, the 
tents have contained the likes 
of Casey and the Sunshine 
Band and local bands such as 
Skavosass and The Blue Moon 
Boys. 



We believe that having 
such bands attend festivals is 
a great idea, but why not let 
the talents of these bands be 
open to everyone? There are 
many people who may not 
have had a chance to hear the 
local bands because they usu- 
ally perform in establishments 
that serve alcohol. 

If these festivals are for 
the community and the beer 
tent is such a large part of 
summer festivities, then why 
are some people forced lo be 
left out because of their age? 

We believe a change of 
the bands' location would be 
appropriate. Perhaps the 
bands could have a separate 
tent from the area where beer 
is sold. Wouldn't a simple 
divider serve the purpose? 

What about a beer sund? 
How about having a beer area 
across the street? What about 
the idea of getting rid of the 
beer tent all together? What 
about no beer at all? 

Some of these Ideas could 
work while others would not 
be feasible. Just think, if the 
beer were gone there would 
be less worrying about drunk 
drivers or about hitting an 
intoxicated person walking 
from the festival. 

This idea is not feasible 
right now. It is obvious that 
the connection between beer, 
music and festivals runs deep 
in this city. All of the festivals 
this summer have a beer tent 
Many of the members on the 
staff are prime examples of 
people who could not attend 
the main attraction of the 



festival. 

We commend those who 
organize the festixals year 
after year. The Three Rivers 
Festival was quite an accom- 
plishment. Every day, an 
event relating to the festival 
occurred somewhere In the 
city. 

Other festivals had deli- 
cious varieties of specific 
foods. For example, the Rib 
Fest has award-winning ribs 
from many states. It is inter- 
esting 10 sec, smell and learn 
about the different varieties of 
ribs. 

Let's face it, to get In on 
the social scene of the festi- 
vals, one has to be 21 or 
older, just like in many other 
establishments in this area. 
Families and those who don't 
wij^h to be around a crowd of 
drinkers may not like the beer 
tents either. Until a change is 
made, many of us will see the 
local festivals, not as festivals, 
but as outdoor bars. 

We aren't sure if It is 
because the citizens won't 
take to a summer without beer 
tents, or if those in charge of 
the festivals think they will 
lose money. 

Some of us on the staff 
have attended festivals in 
other towns that don't have a 
beer tent. The bands were 
great, ihe people were having 
a good time and the places 
were packed. Come on Fort 
Wayne, give it a try. Make the 
festivals an activity that 
everyone can enjoy. 



LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 



Response to Staff Editorial 



Older and wiser 

By Kathy Delagrange, Cupv Editor 



Internet a place to express ideas; paragraphs too short 



First, let mc say that I am pleased that you make the effort to get a 
paper out in the summer. It must be frustrating to try to find topics 
when the campus is running at only half speed, 

1 would like to make two comments about the editorial, although 
the second applies to many, if not most, of the articles. 

One comment relates to content. I agree with some of the points 
made, including those relating to illegal activities such as child 
pornography and the copying of CDs. 1 become concerned when the 
discussion deals with the regulation of things that can "corrupt the 
weak-minded." 

One basis for our system of government is that everyone has the 
same right to express his or her ideas and that the public as a whole 
will make good judgments in the long run. What one person believes 
strongly, another may find distasteful or offensive. We don't need 
"thought police" determining that those espousing Satanism should 
have greater freedom of expression than members of the Ku Klux Klan, 
the Hare Krishnas, the Mormons, the Hindus, the Muslims, or the 
Baptists. 

Regulation of the Internet should be restricted to areas such as 
protection of rights like copyrights and protection of children from 
potentially harmful sites. Adults must be free to make their own deter- 
mination of what to investigate, and not to have that decision made by 
"Big Brother" watching over them. 

The other comment is the real reason for my writing. I am well 
aware of the journalistic approach to writing that encourages the use 
of short paragraphs. Today's exposure to "sound bites" probably 
makes that even more important 

However, even under these circumstances, the procedure can be 



carried to suth an extreme that it interferes with the reading of an 
article; The editorial is a case in pbirtt. Here are some "paragraphs" 
from the article that don't function as paragraphs: 

"Legally, these files are only allowed to be 15 seconds long." Aside 
from the fact that what is meant is, "Legally, these files are allowed to 
be only 15 seconds long," this sentence is so closely tied to the previ- 
ous that it has no meaning without it. 

"The same situation..." The same as what? 

"However, only a small effort has been made to do so." To do 
what? 

"However, the FBI can only efficiently enforce these laws in the 
United States." What laws? (Again, a more accurate word order would 
be, "However, the FBI can efficiently enforce these laws only in the 
United States.") 

"Besides, the FBI has domestic laws that need to be enforced as 
well." Besides what? As well as what? 

"Without one, all of these crimes we've mentioned are bound to 
keep happening." Without one what? 

I'm sure this sounds very critical, but I don't mean to be putting 
down the paper or your efforts. It's a lengthy comment about a rela- 
tively small point, i just want to point out an area that has reached the 
stage of interfering with my reading of many of the articles. 

Thanks for your attention and best wishes for The Communicator.

'IPSGA Update' new focus for former IPSGA senator 

As many have been aware, IPSGA has been undergoing changes. If you like to write new stories and you want to cover IPSGA, join 

many of which have been good. As many have also been aware, 1 was The Communicator. If you cannot write, but still have a journalistic 
decidingif I will be a part of IPSGA this coming fall. I am sorry to offi- ' - 
cially say that 1 have decided not to come back to IPSGA for the 1999- 
2000 school year. Many people have been asking me, "Why?" I have 
three reasons why I came to that decision. 

1. In my only year as senator. 1 have done a lot and feel like it is 
time for someone else to step in to further what 1 did in IPSGA. 

2. Being in IPSGA for four years (first three semesters in the 



feeling, c 



e down to College 56 studios in Helmke Library and talk to 



Watch "IPSGA Update" and read The Communicator to see what Is 
happening in IPSGA. More importantly, write to either College 56 or 
The Communicator and tell us how we can improve our coverage of 
IPSGA. 

-- - Both College 56 and The Communicator want to be there to best 

btudent Activities Board), it tends to get boring at times, doing the inform you and your feedback is encouraged. I will see you on College

bad thing. In some cases It is a good thing, i.e. "Us Vegas Night" The lives in Allen County and has Comcast Cable to tape it for you. 
hunger for changing student life here at IPFW was not strong enough 
for me to continue.) Sincerely, 

3. More importantly, 1 decided to leave to take part in a new 
arena, the arena of journalism. Daniel J. Wesirlck 

Ever since IPSGA Senate Profile aired last year on college cable 
access, Channel 6 (now College 56) students learned about their sena- 
tors. The show was a success for many people. The show evolves from 
a profile show to an informative show. Starting this September, College 
56 will air "IPSGA Update." 

"IPSGA Update" will inform viewers about what IPSGA is doing to 
better students' lives here at IPFW, talk with the major players in 
IPSGA and at IPFW on their points of view, present a round- 
table discussion on the issues and explain how IPSGA works. Editorial Policv 
Kim Rife will host tiie show and I will be the IPSGA con-espon- i-^n^na, /-who/ 
dent 

You might be wondering, "Why is College 56 covering 
IPSGA and not The Communicator?" I do not know the 
answer, but 1 can encourage my newspaper counterparts to 
keep you up to date on what is happening in IPSGA as much 
as possible. I hope the staff will get some people on board as 
IPSGA correspondents for the newspaper. This newspaper 
comes out once a week, but the show will air every other 
week. In some cases, the newspaper will get something out 
about IPSGA before College 56 does and vice versa, but the 
goal is the same: informing the viewer/reader on current 
events happening at IPFW/in IPSGA. *o&lt;at. Submltilons lot tho rie&gt;t »eek's Isiue must bo received prior lo i p.m. Talepho 

So, 1 encourage you to do any of the following: on the Friday before the loue H printed for timely contldaretlon. Adwertiiing: 



Editor's note: As much as The Communicator tries to cover IPSGA 
events, it is not always possible to do so due to space limitations, 
scheduling conflicts, etc. Also, we currently have no plans of making 
an IPSGA correspondent position at this time. 




After working in the health center of a 
retirement community (or in layman's terms, 
a nursing home) for nearly a year, I think that 
I can safely say that nothing can surprise me 
anymore. 

In fact, the very first day that I began 
training to become a certified nursing assis- 
tant (CNA), I was greeted by a resident 
(patient, for the layperson) wearing only his 
shirt and hat. The hallway was rather dim in 
that particular spot and I thought, "No, it 
couldn't be..." 

I soon realized that it could and in fact, it 
was as he twirled around with a CNA hot on 
his heels. She told him that he was not to 
leave his room without being fully dressed to 
which he replied, "I'm only going to be a 
minute. I just need to find her. 1 think she 
went out here." 

Now, I don't want to paint the elderly as 
senile or crazy. To speak the truth, I immense- 
ly enjoyed the time that I spent working with 
these folks. I laughed often and cried occa- 
sionally, but I always found great pleasure in 
caring for God's older children. 

Interestingly enough, my "favorites" were 
often the ones that could be the most difTlcuIt 
to deal with. Some suffered from senile 
dementia or Alzheimer's, others were in the 
advanced stages of illness and some were just 
plain lonely. 

Sure, some of them gave me, a person 
less than one-fourth of their age, a run for my 
money once in a while, but what's not to love 
about a 96-year-old man that says, "There's 
that 'good-lookin' girl I was lookln for. Wanna 
go for a walk?" 

One learned to really "see" these people 
for who they were and who they had been in 
the past It can be easy to confuse the individ- 
ual with the illness, but one must remember 
that they are separate entities. 

I loved my work with these special people 
and I will probably never forget most of them. 
As morbid as it may sound, I still check the 
tributes in the newspaper, not so much to see 
who has passed away, but to remind myself of 
who those people were. 

I am truly grateful for having been grant- 
ed the privilege of having these people's care 
entrusted to me. It was an honor.

Why did we come here, anyway? 



by Darci L. Denton, Staff Writer 

We come Into this world with nothing and we leave this 
world with nothing. In between, we aspire to acquire. 

As Americans, who are we without all of our "stuff?" It 
seems that our ob|ective Is to purchase, maintain and insure 
more stuff than the guy next door. Did we come to this country 
to be liberated, only to be bound by our own shallow desire to 
be judged by what we have, and not who we are? 

I think it has something to do with leading or following, 
passing or shooting, riding or driving. As Americans, don't we 
want to be known for our leadership abilities? Wouldn't we 
rather shoot and drive than pass and rldeT When we compete 
with one another through our material possessions, we do so 
with imitation and mimicry. If we don't dare to be different, we 
stand little chance of breaking new ground within and outside 
ourselves. 

Classic and obvious examples {in my opinion) of the "battle 
of the stufr can be found In nearly every new housing addition 
in the county. All of the houses look so similar on the outside 
that it is easy to Imagine them being just as cognate on the 




inside. No doubt many of the occupants* personal possessions 
are also under suspicion of being similar. It bores me just dri- 
ving through these characterless little suburban Utopias. 

What do any of us possess that we will want or need by our 
side when we draw our final breath? 1 doubt that any of us can 
honestly say that it is a sacred possession that will give us com- 
fort in our last hours. I'd bet all that I own (which isn't much to 
some but which I'm sure is way too much) that all of us would 
trade our mo't prized possession for the touch of one we love 
before we leave here. 

Senior citizens are a wonderful source of wisdom and all of 
us are in a position to have contact with someone in this age 
group if we truly want to. Ask someone you know who is SL\t&gt;' 
or better what tliey find to be the more important things in life. 
If you know someone who has had a close call with the Grim 
Reaper, you've probably already been privy to a revelation or 
two. 

Our personal philosophies of life tend to change with age 
or when we have experienced a total out-of-body reality' as 
when you "die and come back." It 
is not my intent to prove or dis- 
prove life after death or anything 
else remotely connected to that 
line of thinking. Whether these 
experiences are real or not isn't as 
important to me as the effect they 
have on the people who experi- 
ence them. My aim is to put you 
m touch with the truly important 
thmgs in life by sharing with you 
some of the answers I've found. 

With everything we've come to 
know about mankind in centuries 
past, we certainly should have 
learned by now that what is 
important in life has nothing to do 
wuh what we own; ultimately we 
own nothing anyway. We must, as 
humans, get some sort of security 
out of having a ton of "stuff." 
Maybe in some crazy way we think 
of our "stufr as a sort of barrier 
against the ultimate truth. The 
more "stufr that's in the way, the 
harder it will be for the truth to 
get to us. Surely we can't just fade 
into nonexistence, especially not 
with all this "stuff" depending on 

One of my professors says there 
are monks and nuns from Tibet 
that own nothing but the clothes 
on their backs. (Incidentally, the 
nuns are visibng Fort Wayne and 
iPFW this week.) How free they 
must feel. How in tune with what 
is real and important they must 
be. A part of me envies their non- 
reliance on the personal artifacts 
that we Americans find so neces- 
sary. They will never know the 
weight of things that are not oblig- 



atory. 

I don't expect that I'll ever be as free as the Tibetan nuns, 
but I certainly can allow myself a glimpse into a part of the 
world that they know. By controlling some of my desires to 
acquire. I put myself in touch with a part of me that is resource- 
ful and self-controlled. Most of the "stufp that we have come to 
believe that we need is really nothing more than ornamental 
camouflage that we have come to rely upon to distance us from 
ourselves and one another. It's really too bad that self-control 
and resourcefulness have become such an extinct state of being. 
We have become a lazy and self-indulgent people and we need 
to shake ourselves up a little and find a healthier way to com- 
pete with one another other than by owning, displaying and 
maintaining so much similar "stuff." 

If you really want to better the world, dare to be different. 
! don't mean tattoos and body piercing when I say be different. 
Just look around you for a few minutes and you will see what 1 
mean: Tattoos and body piercings are a dime a dozen and there 
is nothing about either one that is unique. By daring to be dif- 
ferent, I mean march to the beat of jour own drum, not some- 
one else's. 

There is something about young people (especially 
teenagers) that causes them to believe that they are being dif- 
ferent, even when they dress and act like one another material- 
ly and mimic one another in dress, language, and hairstyle. 
Why do any of us want to be someone other than who we are? 

The generations that follow us are relying on us to keep a 
clear perspective on what is important in life. Deep down in our 
hearts, we all know that our "stufP is merely superficial and of 
no real importance in the greater scheme of things. When I'm 
dead and gone I'm sure that no one will care about or remem- 
ber the kind of car 1 drove or the kind of jeans that i wore. My 
style of hair and the artifacts that I possess upon my passing 
will be of minute importance to those who knew me. I'm bet- 
ting that how I lived and the emotional impressions that I have 
had on the people in my life will be what those who knew me 
will talk aboui. I'm betting the same will be true for all of us. 

1 make a conscious effort not to march to the beat of 
another's drum. I prefer to create my own music, and it doesn't 
have to be marched to; I can move any way I like. Be a true 
American and make your own 
music. You might be surprised 
at how many people you will 
find that will appreciate the 
music that you make. 

Wouldn't you rather leave 
music than "stuff?"

Summer Memories 

by Mlsharxna Wood, Managing Editor 




Working, spending afternoons at the 
beach, attending parties and traveling outside 
of fort Wayne are typical summers for many 
students at IPFW. There are also those of us 
who are taking summer classes or internships. 

Summer is quickly coming to an end, 
though. A walk through any store will display 
markdowns on sandals and shorts and adver- 
tisements for "back to school days," 

To me, this is one of the most obvious 
signs that there are only a few weeks left to 
the summer. As a matter of fact, there is only 
one week left of summer classes at IPFW and 
three more weeks until the fall semester 
begins. 

Due to the fact that we don't have a paper 
if classes are not in session, The 
Communicator will not appear on campus 
until classes resume. 

The staff of The Communicator would like 



to lake this opportunity to thank our readers 
for their support thus far. It has been an inter- 
esting summer that has had many changes. A 
change in almost every position has occurred 
at our paper during the summertime. 

There has been a skeleton crew putting 
the paper together. We have had to deal with 
an office that has been under construction all 
summer. I can remember one evening when 
members of our staff could not work in the 
office due to the construction. Currently, the 
lights are dim and the dust is thick. 

Hopefully the work in Walb will be com- 
pleted soon and we will have a full staff by the 
fall semester. There are four weeks left after 
this summer session for all of you to enjoy. 
Take advantage of the time off. 

Thanks again for your support during the 
summer and we hope to hear from you this 
fall.

Fort Wayne's Cinema Center student-friendly 



by Eric Baus, 
Slatt Writer 



fort Wayne's Cinema 
Center Is a non-profit film 
society that was founded in 
1976. Until 1991. when the 
Cinema Center moved to its 
permanent location on Clay 
Street near Berry, films were 
shown at various locations 
such as the Allen County 
PMblic Library or the Fort 
Wayne Museum of Art. The 
move to a permanent struc- 
ture allowed the Center to 
finally show films in the 
industry standard 35mm 
format. 

"Our mission is to show 
independent, foreign, docu- 
mentar)' and specialty films 
and to provide educational 
opportunities relating to 
film," explains Cinema Center 
director, Catherine Lee. 
"Although we show a lot of 
American independent films, 
we show almost anything 
interesting that gets over- 
looked by the major theaters 
in town." This includes bring- 



ing bacl( films that didn't get 
much exposure at the major 
release theaters and giving 
them a second run, such as 
"An Ideal Husband," which 
only ran for two weeks. 

Many films are quickly 
abandoned by commercial 
theaters if they don't see big 
box office returns immediate- 
ly. Because the Cinema Center 
is subsidized in part by local 
groups like the Foellinger 
Foundation, Arts United, and 
the Fort Wayne Community 
Foundation, and because of 
revenues from ticket sales, it 
is able to bring movies to the 
Fort Wayne area that may be 
of artistic or educational 
value, but are not necessarily 
money-making blockbusters. 

The Cinema Center has 
given the Fort WajTie commu- 
nity the opportunitj' to view, 
in advance of the opening 
date, the critically-acclaimed 
film, "In the Company of 
Men," which was shot primari- 
ly in the Fort Wayne area. 
"Many of our volunteers 
worked on the nim, and the 
film's director Neil Labutte 




graciously let us have a cou- 
ple of weeks of shows before 
the studio release date," com- 
mented Lee. 

The Cinema Center has 
also had an ongoing coopera- 
tive involveMent with IPFW. 
"We're really student friend- 
ly," Lee added. For several 
years, the Cinema Center has 
provided a space for IPFW's 
visiting writers series orga- 
nized by IPFW's director of 
creative writing, George 
Kalamaras. World renowned 
poets and fiction writers such 
as Chitra Divakaruni, 
Nathaniel Mackey, Forrest 
Gander and others have given 
readings in the theater which 
were free and open to the 
public. 

"The Cinema Center is a 
gorgeous space to host a read- 
ing. Its acoustics are great. 
Offering readings there fur- 
thers the VWS mission to 
reach out to the community, " 
added ICalamaras. 

"We just upgraded our 
sound system about a year 
ago," explained Lee, "and it's 
a very live sounding place to 
begin with, so people can 
hear well anj-where." 

IPFWs French Club runs 
a five-film French film series 
every year. The Cinema 
Center, in conjuncdon with 
SAB, ran a promotional 
showing of the film "Botde 
Rocket" for students. IPFWs 
Diversity Council has been 
increasingly active in various 
events at the Cinema Center, 
An IPFW class on cine- 
matic representations of the 
Holocaust taught by profes- 
sors Jeanne Barone and 
Steve Cart has been held at 
the Cinema Center. During a 
recent Human Rights films 
series showing of the docu- 
mentary "The Saitmen of 
Tibet," IPFW professors Beth 
Simon and Alan Sandstrom 
led a panel discussion and 
provided a political and cul- 
tural context for the film. 
"We do occasionally invite 
IPFW professors to speak 
after certain films," Lee said. 
Currently, there is an

The big buzz around 
the Cinema Center 
now is the imminent 
Fort Wayne showing 
of independent hor- 
ror/ faux-documen- 
tary film "The Blair

cooked up on their 

own. 

The plot revolves around 
three Universit&gt;' of Marjland 
film students who set out to 
make a documentary about 
the myths and mysteries sur- 
rounding a town plagued by a 
vengeful witch. There is a 
creepy and informative web- 
site about the film ac 
www.blairwltch.com that 
has an array of timelines, 
interviews, photographic evi- 
dence and scrawled excerpts 
from character's journals. The 
film has confused many audi- 
ences because it has such an 
authentic look. 

Lee explained that the 
actors were put through a 
number of rigorous and 
frightening ordeals by the 



filmmakers to get them to per- 
form with more emotion and 
authenticity. They were left 
alone in the elements for long 
periods of time and secretly 
terrorized by the crew during 
the filming to coax the best 
performances. "People are 
coming out of the film terri- 
fied," stated Lee. 

Check your local listings 
for information and times of 
this and other films at the

Writer's adventures inspired 
by 'A Walk in the Woods' 



by Nancy Simmonds, 
Guest Writer 



"A Walk in the Woods" 
by Bill Bryson 
Co. 1998, 

Broadway Books; 27S effort- 
less pages 

If summer session 1 and II 
keep you in Indiana, Bill 
Bryson's, "A Walk in the 
Woods," is a $13 armchair 
vacation, worthy of any 
evening's time. 

Bill and his old school 
buddy, Stephen Katz, take off 
for a summer's hike on the 
Appalachian trail. Outfitted 
with a three-season tent, a bag 
of Snickers, a nifty 
compass/thermometer key 
ring, a big knife for killing 
bears, S pounds of rice, 
M&amp;Ms, more Snickers, assort- 
ed Little Debbie's, and Spam, 
Katz and Bryson provide a lot 
of laughs as well as an enter- 
taining look at the histor&gt;' and 
maintenance of the 
Appalachian Trail. 

Stretching 1200 miles 
from Maine to Georgia, only 
10 percent of those who 
attempt the full hike actually 
complete it. Half don't make it 
past central Virginia, less than 
one-third of the way. Twenty 
percent drop out the first 
week. Bryson and Katz, two 
overweight men with a love 
for X-Files and junk food, 
prove that something as 
daunting as this trail can be a 
great deal of fun. 

Br&gt;son writes that most 
beauty in America is some- 
thing that you drive to. Think 
about our Fort Wayne area. 
Where do we have expansive 
beauty without the intrusion 
of civilization? Certainly not 
on the Rivergreenway. 

Drive to Pokagon or 
Chain O'Lakes and you have a 
fellow hiker or canoeist within 
shouting distance, or even 
whispering distance on the 
weekends. One of the 
Bicentennial Wood properties 



can afford a more solitary, 
though certainly not lengthy 
walk. 

1 laced up my hiking 
boots and took the dog with 
me to a relatively unused 
park. We hiked the rwo-mile 
course three times. It was hot 
in the sun, though markedly 
cooler in the woods. I heard 
tree frogs and unidentified 
bird calls, but only above the 
panting of my Airedale. 

1 smelled honeysuckle 
and bug spray and ate a mini- 
handful of barely ripened 
blackberries. It was fun. 
However, 1 realized chat I may 
not view this place the same 
way when sporting a forty 
pound backpack Hey, 1 could 
do this. Boomer weighs a litde 
over that much, 

1 hoisted a stiff and 
unhappy dog in my arms. It 
was 83 degrees and she was 
way too hairy. 1 lasted ten 
steps before I dumped her on 
the ground. She gave me such 
a look of disgust before trot- 
ting off. Two thousand one 
hundred miles seemed a very 
long way. 

Several years ago, I met a 
woman from southern Indiana 
who had hiked ail but the last 
700 miles of die trail. She was 
calm, full of inner reserve, 
probably due to five months 
of solitary survival of die AT. 
Falling and breaking her leg, 
she had to quit, but had plans 
to finish her hike in the near 
future. She may well have fin- 
ished her hike and gone again 
by this time. 

Bryson says hiking the AT 
is a contradiction: tedious but 
irresistible. You want to quit, 
yet you want to do it forever! 
You want to escape civiliza- 
tion, yet ache for the comforts 
of home. 

One of the benefits of 
long distance hiking is that 
time ceases to be of impor- 
tance. When it is dark, you go 
to bed. When it is light, you 
get up. When you are hungry, 
you eat— if you haven't 
pitched your Little Debbie's 



and Spam due to their weight 
I am tethered to my 
clock. I cannot imagine 
months without it, refusing to 
bring it because its ounces 
could be carried in a more 
profitable way. I can see how 
someone would bum to com- 
plete their 2100 miles if 1400 
were already under their 
soles. 

There are people who 
hike the AT as far as they can 
go in their allotted vacation 
time, then quit and come back 
to continue at that spot the 
following year. These are 
called "section hikers." The 
record for the longest section 
hike is forty-six years. 

Many different kinds of 
people have completed 
"through-hikes": a fellow in 
his 80's, a blind man and his 
seeing-eye dog, a guy on 
crutches, and a fellow named 
Woodrow Murphy who 
weighed 350 pounds and was 
doing it to lose weight. His 
first week he averaged five 
miles per day, but he persist- 
ed and by the time he fin- 
ished, he had lost S3 pounds. 

Bryson also writes of the 
changes to the trail. In its 60 
years of existence, the face of 
it has been altered due to 
budget misappropriations, 
clear-cutting, gypsy moths 
and pollution. See it while you 
can. Nothing in America lasts. 
What does last Is friend- 
ship. Without giving anything 
away, in addition to the walk 
in the woods, Bryson tells a 
powerful story of his relation- 
ship with Katz and how their 
journey affects them both. 
This would make a great 
buddy movie. Bryson writes 
with humor and reaLsm. 

If you have ever imag- 
ined yourself attempting to 
hike the Appalachian Trail, 
you will not be discouraged 
by their challenges; rather 
you will be encouraged to be 
part of such an adventure. Get 
out your hiking boots, even if 
only to the wilds of Chain 
O'Lakes.

The Firefly Cafe: New brew near campus 



by Eric Baus, 
Staff Writer 



Do you have an hour or two 
between classes In your schedule? Is 
the coffee in the vending machines 
on campus not cutting it? Now there 
is an alternative close to campus, the 
Firefly Cafe. 

Open since July 1. the cafe is 
located at 3523 North Anthony, next 
to the Health Food Shoppe. Krislen 
Demaree, who is helping her brother 
and sister-in-law Paul and Cindy 
launch the cafe, said they want to 
make it a place where studenu and 
other customers feel comfortable 
hanging out. 

"We're trying to make it a wel- 
coming environment," Demaree stat- 
ed. "It's a great place to come to 
study." 

A 10 to 12 seat conference room 
in the back of the cafe that groups 



can book at no charge will soon be 
open. Plans are also in the works to 
expand the juice bar. 

"We're trying to see what people 
like. We're working with the health 
food store next door," added 
Demaree. 

Besides the usual coffee options, 
the Firefly Cafe offers a full range of 
soy-based drinks, sandwiches, vege- 
tarian snacks, desserts, and salads. 
For those with simple tastes and not 
a lot of money, the cafe offers 
"unlimited brew" for S2 so you can 
drink coffee and read all day long in 
air-conditioned comfort. 

Seating consists of both outdoor 
and indoor tables as well as several 
large couches where customers can 
read a magazine or check out local 
artist David Birke&gt;'s work which is 
currentl&gt; on display. 

Along with the presentation of 
local artists' work, the Firefly Cafe 
hosts "Monday night quiz night" at 8 
p.m.. a Tuesday night open mike 



night, and an array of scheduled 
musicians on Friday and Saturday 
nights. Demaree, who recently 
helped to open coffee shops in 
England, says the quiz nights are 
based on a popular pastime in 
English pubs. 

"It's a great time. The more peo- 
ple you have on &gt;our team, the 
greater the chances that someone 
will know the answers," said 
Demaree. So bring a friend or ten 
when you stop by on Monday nights 
and compete for fame and fortune. 

Demaree says the cafe is very 
interested in attracting the student 
crowd. IPFW students with school I.D. 
will receive a 10 percent discount. 

With all it has to offer, the 
Firefly Cafe is a much needed and 
welcome addition to the IPFW cam- 
pus area. I'm certainly looking for- S 
ward to my next steamed so&gt;'milk. 

Cafe hours are 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
Monday-Thursday and 6 a.m. to 1 1 
p.m. on Fridaj's and Saturdays.

by Nancy Simmonds, 
Guest Writer 



Talented Drew Barrymore 
gives a multi-faceted perfor- 
mance as Josie Geller, a 
Chicago Sun Times copy edi- 
tor sent to a local high school 
for an undercover story. 

Josie had been horribly 
humiliated in her real high 
school historj' and is deter- 
mined and delighted to go 
back and make things right. 

Who hasn't wished for 
. the opportunity, especially a 
i-|econd chance, tp heal the 
; painful high school years? 



Josie finds herself in the 
same nerdish group all over 
again, still socially inept and 
far from the popularity she 
always dreamed of achieving. 
Wired for sound and video, 
the newsroom eavesdrops on 
Josie's loser life. Her boss calls 
it the All Humiliation 
Network. Ordered by her 
superiors to join the "in" 
crowd, Josie enlists her 
friends and family in the 
transition. It is painful to 
watch her new cruelty to her 
nerdish fiiends. 

Why do socially success- 
ful groups of people close 
I ranki against anyone remote- 



ly different? What do they 
fear? In an English class, the 
teacher leads a discussion on 
the freedom of disguise. Shy 
Josie applies this lesson to her 
life and, among other things, 
dreams of true love. Well, 
with a title like "Never Been 
Kissed," what do you expect? 

I had heard mixed 
reviews of the movie, mostl&gt; 
negative comments about the 
screenplay, but m&gt;' friends 
really liked the movie and 
jumped at the chance to see it 
again with me. The&gt; said the 
portrait of the anguish of high 
school was all too real. And, 
yup, there, were, tears at the 



unchanging cruelty of the 
popular crowd to those who 
were not. 

1 thought the levels of 
Josie's character were very 
well performed: "Josie Grosie" 
in high school, Josie as Happy 
High School Nerd part 2, Josie 
as totally "transitioned" into a 
popular girl, and Josie accept- 
ing her true self. This fluff)' 
yet charming movie has ^ 
message for high school si 
dents that most adults ha 
trouble accepting. No matt 
who &gt;ou might think y&lt; 
want to be, you are happit 
embracing and acknowledgii 
who you really are. 



The biggest threat to 

depression is your 

Q-wareness of it.

Spike Lee's explosive 
'Summer of Sam' 



by Eric Baus, 
Staff Writer 



Strangely, Spike Lee's new 
film "Summer of Sam" has 
ver&gt;' little to do with the .44 
calibre killer. 

This is not another film 
chat allows the audience to 
voyeuristically enter the mind 
of a madman. Instead, it is a 
detailed emotional explo- 
ration of how a community, 
immersed in fear and distrust 
turns on itself. 

Although the sior&gt; is 
based on actual events, it is 
less a sensationalized docu- 
mentary than it is a contem- 
porary version of "Lord of the 
Flies." 

Rational thinking and the 
social order have been dis- 
rupted by an unpredictable 
and uncontrollable series of 
events. 

This is a story of what 



happens when no one knows 
what to do. The police turn to 
the mafia for help, the locals 
turn into paranoid \'igilantes, 
friends turn on friends and 
ever&gt;one is afraid. 

I was relieved by the fact 
that Lee doesn't spend a lot of 
time delving into ihe ps&gt;che 
of the murderer. The "Son of 
Sam" is a deranged person, 
not God or the de\ii or a bril- 
liant criminal mastermind. 

He is just a screwed-up 
loser who lost control and 
never got it back. Lee makes 
this cr&gt;stal clear with a brief 
scene in which a talking dog 
commands the killer to con- 
tinue murdering. 

The killer acts more like 
severe weather, subject to an 
irrational temperament 
beyond anyone's control, than 
an elusive criminal. Lee makes 
the right decision to focus on 
the aftershocks rather than 
the explosions of violence 
themselves. 



Although 1 don't think 1 
would want to see it again, 
"Summer of Sam" is one of 
Lee's best. Characters and 
scenes are allowed to develop 
naturall)'. The visual elements 
of the films are expressive 
without being over-the-top or 
pretentious. The dialogue 
seems to x-ray the hidden 
thoughts, fears, and motiva- 
tions of the characters. 

Lee is a raritj' in a com- 
mercially viable film, a person 
who understands how to tell 
the right stories in an emo- 
tionall)' honest wa;.'. 

In a perfect world, Spike 
Lee would have written and 
directed "The Phantom 
Menace." 

Other recommended 
Spike Lee films available 
on video: 

"Do the Right Thing" 
"Clockers" 
"Malcolm X" 
"He Got Game"

Idi the Mike: 



Today as opposed to 



by Brian Miller, 
Sports Editor 



An old 
proverb states: 
"Live one day at a 
time and each day 
as if it were your 
lasL" 

It's amazing 
just how much peo- 
ple (including 
myself) take life for 
granted. 

On July 10. 
former Indiana bas- 
ketball pla&gt;er and 
Auburn resident 
Luke Recker suf- 
fered multiple 
injuries when the 
vehicle he was rid- 
ing in was struck by 
a drunk driver in 



Durango, Colorado. 

Fortunately, 
Luke had no life- 
threatening 
injuries. Sadly, 
however, his girl- 
friend Kelly Craig, 
19. and her brother 
Jason, 17, both suf- 
fered serious 
injuries, 

Recker and the 
Craigs were passen- 
gers in a car driven 
by John Hollberg. 
23. of Senoia, GA, 
who was killed. 

The driver 
whose car hit 
Recker's vehicle has 
been charged with 
20 criminal counts. 

Just weeks 
before Luke was hit, 
he was here at IPFW 




Recker at the IPFW Baskeiball Camp. 



volunteering at 
Coach Noll's sum- 
mer camp. 

Although 
Recker has not 
commented on the 
accident, one can 
just imagine how 
tragic it must be. 

In a matter of 
minutes, Recker 
went from joking 
around and having 
a good time to 
being pinned 
between a warped 
passenger door and 
a dying friend. 

Basketball just 
doesn't seem that 
important. 

Luke has beei] 
a role model for 
many kids in the 
community and it's 
tragic to see things 
like this happen to 
good people. 

Through a hos- 
pital spokesperson, 
Recker's family 
thanked the com- 
munity for Its 
prayers and 
req uested that 
instead of flowers, 
donations be made 
to Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving.
