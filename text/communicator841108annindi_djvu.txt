Indiana Unrversrty-Pirdue University at Fort Wayne 



THrsday. November 8. 1984 




Original faculty reflect on campus growth 



By CAROLYN SUWYN 

Staff writer 

Unlimited opportunity for 
advancement, a chance to be 
involved in the decision making 
process, and a chance to try 
something new were cited as 
reasons many professors came to 
IPFWinl964. 

Of the new faculty members 
moving into the new building now 
known as Kettler Hall, about a 
dozen are still here. 

John Ulmer, dean of student 
services, was finishing his 
doctorate in education on the 
Bloomington campus when he 
was asked if he would like to 
come to IPFW as an academic 
adviser of students. He said he 
thought it would be an "in- 
teresting challenge." 

"In 1964 there were only two 



/9M/POT- 




20U 



NNIVERSARY- 



programs that granted degrees. 
Today there are over 100," Ulmer 
said. He believes the number of 
degrees added over the 20 years 
might be a record in the growth 
Of any academic institution. 

Harold W. Davis, Jr., professor 
of biological sciences, washired 
in the 1963 recruiting season to 
start teaching in the fall of 1964. 
Davis said he took the teaching 
position in the biolc^ depart- 



ment because it was within 
commuting distance to Michigan 
State University where he was 
finishing his doctorate. He felt at 
the time it would te a temporary 
position for him. 

Davis decided to stay because 
"it was like being on a new 
frontier." He said there was a 
new building, new equipment, 
and fresh faces. "It was almost 
analogous to starting your own 



business," he said. Davis said 
getting in on the ground floor 
gave one lots of opportunity for 
decision-making and ad- 
vancement. He said everyone 
was friendly and everyone knew 
each other personally from the 
bottom to the top. 

He said overall he is very 
pleased with IPFW's progress 
over the years. The only thing he 
thought was divergent from the 
original plan was the idea there 
would be more technical 
programs that could be com- 
pleted here. 

Maynard J. Mansfield, 
professor of mathematics and 
chair o£ the department, was an 
associate professor when he 
came to IPFW. He was recruited 
by the mathematics department 
of the Purdue campus and had 
his choice of Indianapolis, 



Calumet or Fort Wayne. 

When asked if his expectations 
had been met, he said he was 
very pleased and he thought that 
the math department was one of 
the top five in the entire state. 

F. Lee Bushong, associate 
professor of supervision, said 
"The growth has been un- 
beUevable." 

He had been working in Adult 
Education for the Fort Wayne 
Community Schools and as a 
teacher trainer for Purdue and 
the State of Indiana. When he 
came to the new campus he was 
working part time in industrial 
education supervision and had 16 
students. Now there are about 
700. 

' "Employers are hiring our 
graduates," he said. Bushong is 
pleased with the program which 
deals with how to manage people.

Kettler's dream in his wallet 



By JENNIFER ACKLEY 
SUff writer 

A small piece of paper, now 
yellowed with age and tattered at 
the edges, represents the dream 
one man had to combine the 
resources of Indiana and Purdue 
universities in Fort Wayne. 

On the paper was a sketch of 
parcels of Land that might be 
acquired for a combined campus. 
The man is Alfred W. KetUer, 
who carried his dream in his 
wallet for years. 

The idea for uniting the two 
universities was conceived by 
Kettler around 1950. Viewing the 
locations of the Purdue Exten- 
sion Building and Indiana 
University Extension in down- 
town Fori Wayne, he questioned 
whether this was the best way to 
promote higher education. 
Kettler, who was elected a 
Purdue trustee In 1947. believed 



the institutions were competing 
with each other. He thou^t the 
students would benefit by the 
union of the two extensions. 

The Indiana -Purdue Foun- 
dation, which Kettler helped 
establish, arranged to purchase 
the tract of land. Plans were then 
made for the construction of the 
first educational building. 

The campus, known as 
Indiana-Purdue Regional 
Campus at Fort Wayne, was 
dedicated on Nov. 8, 1964. The 
key-note speaker at the 
Mremony was Judge John S. 
Hastings, chief justice of the 
Seventh District U.S. Court of 
Appeals in Chicago and former 
president of the Indiana 
University Board of Trustees. 

In his address, Hastings said, 
"I name one man whose unselfish 
devotion and complete personal 
dedication to this project sym- 



bolizes the spirit of all who 
participated. I refer to Mr. 
Alfred W. Kettler of Fort Wayne 
— faithful servant erf our 
universities and outstanding 
public citizen." 

In May of 1973, Kettler was 
honored for his commitment to 
the development of IPFW by the 
naming of the first major campus 
buildingAlfredW. Kettler Hall. 

Recognized as playing a vital 
role in advancing community 
support and financial assistance 
for the joint campus, Kettler is 
quick to point out others were 
involved in the effort, "My name 
has been mentioned too many 
times," he said in a past in- 
terview. 

Although he now prefers to 
remain on the sidelines, Kettler 
is described as the "most per- 
sistent party behind the uniting 
of the two extension operations"

and historian, Ankenbruck is the 
autjior of "The Creation Years," 
a book about IPFW. 

As a result of Kettler's in- 
spiration and dedication, IPFW 
is the sixth largest institution of 
higher education in Indiana. In 
order to retain its standard of 
quality, Kettler believes that 



IPFW must continue to offer a 
well-rounded curriculum, in 
addition to keeping astride the 
changing world. "Academics are 
Hrsl; that's what we're here for," 
he said. 

A 1915 Purdue graduate. 
Kettler was a recipient of the 
Distinguished Alumni Award, 
presented by the National 
Alumni Association in l%7. In 
1971. he received the first 
honorar&gt;' doctorate to be con- 
ferred by the Purdue University 
Fort Wayne Campus, 

Kettler, 92, is a retired con- 
struction engineering firm head. 
He and his wife. Margery, 91, 
lead an active life by keeping in 
contact with their two sons, Bill, 
65, and Ed, 61. and their families. 

Recently, Kettler donated his 
sketch of the proposed Indiana 
University-Purdue combined 
campus to the IPFW archives. 
Although he no longer carries it 
in his wallet, Kettler's dream- 
come-true will forever remain in 
his heart. 




Walb helps to bridge I.U. and Purdue 



WALTER W.WALB 



By BRAD BERGGOETZ 
Staff writer 

Purdue University's school of 
civil engineering has produced 
some excellent engineers since it 
was established, one of which is 
the late Walter W. Walb. His 
contributions to the local 
business community and IPFW 
are numerous. 

The Walb Memorial Union was 
named after Walter W. Walb in a 
dedication ceremony Sept. 20, 
1977. Walb made many con- 
h-ibutions to IPFW and played a 
key role in bringing Indiana 
University and Purdue 



University together in Fort 
Wayne. 

Walb, who died in 1976, had an 
active interest in the Fort Wayne 
campus over the years. He had 
many connections with Purdue 
University. He was a past 
president of the Purdue Alumni 
Association, a trustee of Purdue 
for three terms, (1968 to 1976) and 
director of the Ross-Ade Foun- 
dation of Purdue, West 
Lafayette. 

In Fort Wayne he served as 
president and director of the 



Indiana-Purdue Foundation 
which played an important role 
in securing the present site of the 
campus. 

Walb was a native of 
LaGrange, Indiana and 
graduated from LaGrange High 
School in the early I920's. He then 
attended Purdue to get his civil 
engineering degree. 

In 1926, Walb started his career 
as an engineer with the Walb 
Construction Company. 

Because of Walb's involvement 
with business around the state 



and in Fort Wayne, his colleges 
named him president and 
director of both the Indiana State 
ChamtKr of Commerce and the 
Fort Wayne Chamber of Com- 
merce. 

In the dedication ceremony 
former Indiana governor Otis 
Bowen paid tribute to Walb, 
saying the union was dedica ted to 
a person whose life contributed 
substantially to the city, state 
and nation, and whom also 
played a key role in the 
development of IPFW.

Neff serves campus more than 40 years 



FLOYD R.NEFF 

By DOUG RUNYAN 

Chief reporter 

When one of the classroom 
buildings at IPFW was named 
Neff Hall, IPFW chose to honor a 
man who had served the Fort 



Wayne regional campus for 
better than40 years. 

When the Fort Wayne branch 
of Indiana University opened in 
1917, Frank W. Shockley was 
named director. His tenure in 
Fort Wayne only lasted one year 
however and his successor was 
Neff. 

Neff was born in 1686 near 
Rochester, Indiana. After high 
school he attended Rochester 
College and subsequently taught 
in nearby schools for four years. 

In 1910 and 1911. Neff attended 
Indiana University in 
Bloomington but left to become 
the principal of Fulton High 
School. He returned to lU in 1912 
and in 1913 graduated with a 
bachelor's degree in English. In 
1914 he taught in EvansvUle and 
in 1915 accepted a teaching 



position in the English depart- 
ment of Central High School in 
Fort Wayne. 

In 1918 when Neff became the 
director of the Fort Wayne 
Center of Indiana University, 
there were only four faculty 
members. Most of the studente 
were teachers and the remaining 
pupUs were older men and 
women interested in courses in 
public speaking, psychology, 
philosophy or national and in- 
ternational problems. 

Neff and the center were 
getting requests by 1927 from 
younger high school graduates to 
offer more courses so more 
college work could be completed 
in Fort Wayne before tran- 
sferring to tbe main campus at 
Bloomington. As a result, in 
September 1927 the first fuU-time 



students were enrolled. There 
were five. 

lU officials credit Neff with 
inaugurating the popular lecture 
series which not only brought 
more classes to the Fort Wayne 
Center but was eventually a 
major part of all of the regional 
campuses. 

Neff guided the Fort Wayne 
Center through decline in the 
Depression and the early 1940's to 
eventual expansion following 
World War II. 

At the SOth anniversary 
banquet of the center in 1967, 
then-IU President Herman Wells 
made the following remarks 
about Neff. 

"Floyd Neff served nearly 
from the beginning and spent a 
lifetime of devotion to the 



development of Indiana 
University in Fort Wayne. His 
sincerity, his courage, his in- 
dustry, and tiis dedication 
carried him through many years 
of struggle with inadequate 
resources. He never faltered in 
his faith or his efforL The lU 
regional campus here is truly the 
lengthened shadow ol Floyd 
Neff." 

Neff retired as campus 
director in 1951. FolltFwing his 
retirement he served the campus 
as an instructor and adviser. In 
1956 he was presented the title of 
emeritus assistant pntfessor of 
English by the Indiana

Helmke dedicated to service 



By MICHELE SHAFFER 
Chief reporter 

He believed "in a continuation 
of the beautiful marriage (bet- 
ween I.U. and Purdue). He 
believed the strength of both 
should continue together." 

Walter P. Helmke, son of the 
la teWalterE. Helmke 

Dedication of the Helmke 
Library,Sept. 20, 1977 

Between Dec. 17, 1901 and Feb. 
4, 1976, Walter E. Helmke, the 
man after whom the IPFW 
library is named, lived a life of 
leadership and dedicated service 
that touched many aspects of 
community life in addition to his 
successful career in law. 

Helmke's involvement in Fort 



Wayne and the surrounding area 
range from politics and religion 
to thearts and education. 

"Everything he did, he was 
very active in," said Helmke's 
wife, Wilma Helmke, That fact 
becomes obvious when one looks 
at the impressive list of activities 
and accomplishments Helmke 
left behind him. 

Helmke, a graduate of Central 
High School, received his degree 
in law from Indiana University in 
1925. Upon graduation, he joined 
the law firm of D. Burns 
Douglass. After 1939, Helmke 
practiced law independently in 
Fort Wayne before forming his 
own law firm. 

Helmke was a trustee of 



Indiana University from 1954 to 
1956, and served as a member of 
the Indiana-Purdue Foundation, 
writing the articles of in- 
corporation for the local campus. 
In 1973, IPFW honored Helmke 
with its first honorary doctorate 
degree, a Doctor of Laws degree. 
Helmke also received from 
IPFW the first Ralph E. Broyles 
Medal, in honor of his significant 
contributions to the local cam- 
pus. 

For Helmke, all of these ac- 
tivities and endeavors were 
equally important because they 
all required the same diligence 
and high standards that he 
constantly demonstrated. 

"He always was active in 



everything." said Mrs. Helmke 
with unassuming pride in her 
husband's accomplishments. 
"And if he was to do something or 
have a job of some kind, he really 
worked hard He didn't fiddle 
around. He was very energetic 
and did what he was supposed to 
do." 

In remembrance of his out- 
standing service to the univer- 
sity, the library, built on the 
IPFW campus in 1970, was 
named in Helmke's honor. 

"It was Indiana's policy not to 
name a building after a person 
until five years after his death," 
said Mrs, Helmke. "Then Mr, 




WALTER E. HELMKE 

(Henry) Rood pushed it and it 
went through the name the. 
building shortly after his death.

As IPFW turns 20 
it looks to its 
future with optimism 



By ANGELA FRANCE 

Chfcf reporter 

For 20 years IPFW has been 
changing, growing and ex- 
panding, and it shows no signs of 
stopping now. 

As Fort Wayne continues to 
grow, IPFW must keep pace with 
the city's ever-changing needs, 

"The mission of this campus is 
to adapt to these needs," said 
Edward A. Nicholson, acting 
chancellor. 

The future of IPFW, in the view 
of its students, may only consist 
of the four years or so that they 
attend classes. But for the 
community, IPFW provides 
athletic and cultural events, 
summer youth camps, adult 
education classes, the Helmke 
Library and, as Nicholson said, 
continues to serve the com- 
munity's economic development 
needs through programs such as 
the Summit Technology and 
Research Transfer Center and 
the Labor ManagementCenter. 

IPFW is currently undergoing 
development and expansion in 
several areas. One of Uiese areas 
is athletics. David R. Skelton, 
Director of Athletics is an- 
ticipating the addition of a 
number of new varsity athletic 
teams. 

The first of these will probably 
be a women's varsity softball 
team, which Skelton hopes will be 
competing this coming spring. 
And, perhaps by next fall, 
Skelton predicts the cross- 
country team, which is now co- 
ed, will spUt into a men's and a 
women's team. 

"Our goal is to have six sports 
for women within the next year 
or two," Skelton said, adding that 
an interest has been expressed in 
a women's varsity goLf team as 
well. 

Skelton said IPFW is entering 
"a new era" in intercollegiate 
sports. "We are Division II in the 
NCAA for the third year, and for 
the first year we're a member of 
the Great Lakes Valley Con- 
ference." Prior to this, the men's 
and women's basketball teams 
were Division III and had no 
conference affiliation. 

"Our level of competition and 
spectator appeal has increased," 
said Skelton. He said the success 
of the varsit&gt;' teams is important 
tjecause their accomplishments 
are what generates the spectator 
appeai. And the spectators 
provide both moral and finaDcial 



support for the athletic teams 
when they come to see an event. 

"Our biggest challenge is 
generating resources to support 
the intercollegiate program," 
Skelton said. There is fan support 
of IPFW's varsity teams now, but 
not the size Skelton hopes to see, 
"Fan support must increase," he 
said, "and we expect it will." 

"We've come a long way in a 
relatively short period of time 
and we hope we can continue to 
move in that direction." 

Nicholson also has a positive 
outlook for the future of the 
campus as a whole. "I suspect 
we'll continue to meet the 
changing needs of the com- 
munity," he said. Nicholson sees 
a trend toward an increased 
emphasis on the humanities, 
liberal arts and performing arts 
within the community. 

To meet these needs, IPFW has 
made a request of the legislature 
for funding for a Fine and Per- 
forming Arts Center on campus, 
wtiich Nicholson believes may be 
a good possibility in the next few 
years. 

"We certainly need additional 
facilities," Nicholson said. In 
addition to the proposed Fineand 
Performing Arts facility, 
Nicholson said there is a need for 
science labs and more room for 
faculty offices. 

Nicholson forsees a small drop 
in enrollment figures for the next 
two years, Init then he expects a 
moderate increase. He predicts 
the longterm trend will be toward 
both moderate increases and 
decreases as the population of 
Fort Wayne changes. 

"The population may inflow 
due to economic development," 
said Nicholson. "If that occurs, 
the campus will grow com- 
mensurate with that inflow." 

As IPFW continues to grow, the 
student may feel left out of the 
decision-making process, 
relegating concerns for the 
future of tiis campus to the 
faculty and administration. But 
students can channel their ideas 
and concerns about the campus 
through Students' Government, 
which Nicholson feels is the most 
effective route- 

"Certainly advice students 
have given us is taken seriously," 
he said. "Too many erf them are 
reluctant to get involved. I would 
be pleased to get more in- 
volvementfrom the students." 




IPFW has grown from one building In 1964 to six In 1984. Twoof those buildings, Helmke Library and 
Neff Hall added in 1972. 




Originally. IPFW was going to grow with all of the building being connected with the inlet west of

PIT celebrates twenty years of art 



By DENISE VAN ORT 
Staff writer 

The ground level of KetUer 
Hall In the northeast comer 
occupies the working space of a 
department where twenty years 
of creativeness, talent and 
careers have been cultivated, 
forming an integral part of the 
cultural life of the IPFW campus 
and the community. 

Purdue-Indiana Theatre, 
coined with the acronym PIT, 
has developed over the past 
twenty years into a respected and 
competitive part of the theatre 
community in Fort Wayne, as 
well as remaining an ex- 
perimental, exemplary medium 
for students to study their craft 



tiiat has tieen acknowledged 
nationwide, 

"PIT established its reputation 
very early," said David 
McCants, chair of the combined 
department of theatre and 
communications since 1383. 
"When the word quality was used 
to describe the campus here, PIT 
was most often what people were 
referring to." 

The building of the department 
into the strength it has today 
began in 1964, when there were 
two separate theatre programs 
offered for Purdue students and 
Indiana students, each with a 
one-person faculty. The theatre 
had not been built yet, and to 
stage the first production, both

the 1i)T5 PIT production of "Hair," which went on to win nationals In 1976. 



faculties combined to do PITs 
first play, MoHere's "The 
Imaginary Invalid." The 
production was staged in the 
Kettler Hall student lounge 
(where Academic Services now 
occupies offices). 

PIT'S new home in Kettler G38 
was ready for the first season of 
productions in the fall of 1965 and 
offered the standard four-play 
season with two plays in the fall 
and two in the spring. 

Because there were less than 
ten theatre majors and the 
programs were still growing, the 
seasons were accompanied with 
productions by graduate touring 
companies of the parent cam- 
puses. 

The program matured, 
eventually merging into one 
strong department with Purdue 
as the parent campus in 1966, and 
acquired administrative 
autonomy In l%8. The theatre 
department graduated its first 
student thatsameyear. 

"PIT needed to be different. It 
has always been somewhat 
avant-garde; productions 
sometimes had a cutting edge to 
them," said Franklin 0. Ken- 
worthy, dean of academic ser- 
vices. Kenworthy joined the 
theatre program in 1967 as 
technical cUrector and served as 
department chairperson during 
the formative years from 1969 to 
1976. 

The turbulent 60's also con- 
tributed to the need for ex- 
pression in theatre, and PIT was 
no exception. Productions that 
made topical social statements 



SUBOG's Hats Are 

Off To IPFW... 

20 Years Of 

Growing 

Bigger 

And Better... 




were those such as "Oh. What a 
Lovely War!" in 1968 and the 
musicar'Viet Rock" in 1969. 

Another advantage for PIT was - 
that as a university theatre, it 
w^^s less dependent upon com- 
mercial support as were com- 
munity theatres that needed the 
insurance of proven box office 
successes. Without that need to 
produce only Broadway hits to 
attract audiences, students, staff 
and audiences had the op- 
portunity to experience different 
forms of theatre from American 
and foreign playwrights. 

In the fall of 1971, Larry Life 
joined the department as 
assistant professor of theatre and 
director. He produced PIT'S first 
major musical, "You're a Good 
Man Charlie Brown," the 
following spring. Life alsoupheld 
the philosophy of creating 
theatre that is uncensored and 
challenging to the audience. 

"Theatre is the mirror that 
reflects life; audiences should 
expect to see theatre that makes 
them think and raises issues," 
said Life. Having directed, 
coreographed and taught theatre 
on campus for almost 14 years, 
Life has brought to PIT con- 
science-raising, as well as classic 
plays and musicals. 

PIT'S national recognition 
came in 1973 with "Dames At 
Sea," winning top honors in the 
American College Theatre 
Festival (ACTF) in Washington, 
D.C. The participation in the 
competition proved PIT's 
professionalism, and with ad- 
ministrative support from the 
campus, went on again to win 
nationals In 1976 with the musical 
"Hair." 

PIT also received national 
alternate In 1975 with "Marathon 
33," also directed by Life. 

Throughout the 70's the 
department not only offered a 
diverse curriculum for students 
to study acting, directing, scene 
design, lighting and costumes. 
There were also workshops and 
alternate theatre productions to 
participate in. Children's plays 
and one-act Off-Broadway plays 
from contemporary playwrights 
were staged; Life also formed a 
student touring company that 
traveled throughout Indiana 
performing musical revues such 
as "Cole Porter" and "A Salute 



to the American Musical 
Theatre" from 1973 to 1976. 

The summer season had also 
grown to include one musical and 
two straight plays. The number 
of theatre majors increased to 
over 33. many of whom went on to 
become successfully employed in 
the theatre. Most notably suc- 
cessful were Julia Buchhelt Barr, 
who plays Brooke on "All My 
Children"; Sharon Gabot who 
played Raven on The Edge of 
Ni^t; and Dan Butler, who has 
appeared on Broadway and was 
the recipient of the 1975 Irene 
Ryan Acting Award. He also 
worked with The American 
Conservatory Theatre in San 
Francisco. Many other PIT 
graduates and former students 
are employed in various areas 
such Ets Off-Broadway, r^ional 
theatre, dance and scene and 
technical design. 

The 80's has seen the same 
professionalism as in the past, 
with a commitment to offering a 
wide range of theatre, from the 
classics like "Romeo and Juliet" 
and "Tartuffe." to contemporary 
pieces "Whose Life is it 
Anyway?" and "Bent," "Bent" 
dealt with the persecution of 
homosexuals in Nazi Germany in 
WWH; raising delicate issues 
and sparring controversy on 
campusand in the community. 

There have also been some 
changes in the theatre depart- 
ment. Personnel changes and a 
drop in the numljer of theatre 
majors and budgetary con- 
straints have all been confronted. 
These changes are represen- 
tative in a national downward 
trend in less concentration on the 
arts and humanities and more on 
technology, 

"There is seen a change in the 
make-up of a theatre student," 
says Life. "There is more 
urgency and a sense of wanting to 
'make it' without the proper 
training." Life says factors such 
as the economy and emphasis on 
technological b'aining all effect a 
student's choice of major. 

One other step that has been 
taken by PIT is the reaching out 
for new audiences. With the 
staging of "Ain't Misbehavin'," 
an all-black cast was provided a 
new opportunity to experience 
the theatre in Fort Wayne. There 
are also plans to have mcve all- 
black productions in the future.

With centennial nearby, art school 
still struggles for facility on campus 



Novembers. 1984 — Special Anniversary Issue— 7 



By DIANA HAWFIELD 
Staff writer 

The struggle for a modern 
facility on the main campus of 
IPFW goes on for the art school. 
The school has occupied their 
current buildings on West Berry 
Street for 62 years and will be 
celebrating its lOOth birthday in 
1988, only four years away. The 
dream is to be able to have the 
party ina newfacility. 

Picturesque though it may be, 
there are many problems with 
the present location that go far 
beyond the leaking roofs of the 
old houses that have been con- 
verted into classrooms and 
studios over the years. 

Russell Oettel, chairman of the 
department since 1965, points out 
that the cramped quarters 
cannot offer the studio space 
much needed by the highly 
qualified faculty for their con- 
tinued professional development. 
Currently, there are ten full-time 
and to part-time faculty mem- 
bers who need studio space badly 
in order to continue their work on 
a high level, 

The relocation of the art school 
onto the main campus would 
promote a healthy interchange of 
ideas beneficial to both the 
students and faculty of the art 
school and the rest of the 
academic community. Currently, 
there is no permanent gallery 
space on the north campus which 



offers adequate security and 
display capabilities. 

A modern facility would also 
provide modern equipment 
necessary to keep pace with 
technological advancements in 
the art world. There is a need to 
enlarge the faculty in order to 
upgrade the curriculum of the 
school, particularly for the third 
and fourth-year students in the 
areas of art history and graphic 
design, which is not possible 
under the current space 
restrictions. 

The department offers a 
bachelor's degree for those who 
wish a background in the liberal 
arts and a bachelor of fine arts 
for those wishing to focus on 
studio work. In addition, there is 
a two-year associate degree 
available in commercial art. The 
department is currently teaching 
250 students, and has ap- 
proximately 160 majors. 

The merger of the art school 
with the university took place in 
1976, after two years of 
negotiations, and brought its 
land, buildings and extensive art 
library with it. At the time, it was 
the last independent art school in 
the state. 

The faculty was also part of the 
deal, although they each had to 
be individually evaluated and put 
under contract. They have since 
proven to be extremely loyal to 
the school, maintaining high 



proiessional profiles. 

There have l)een plans for new 
structures over the years. Oettel 
is still in possession of the Louis 
Kahn designs from the 1960's for 
the downtown fine arts center. 
They are complete right down to 
the electrical wiring, twt had to 
be postponed due to lack of 
funding. 

The first classroom, back in 
1888, was on the second floor of a 
building at the southwest corner 
of Wayne and Calhoun streets, 
but it was poorly lighted and 
equipped, so a whole series of 
moves began. The first instructor 
was J. Ottis Adams. 

Much of the early growth was 
accomplished through the efforts 
and contributions (rf Fort Wayne 
women. In 1892 Margaret 
Hamilton donated her old 
carriage house on East Lewis 
Street as well as a good deal of 
financial assistance to "The 
Student's Art League," as they 
were then called. There was no 
formal organization at the time 
and no public support. 

Agnes Hamilton, Margaret's 
niece and an instructor for a 
short while, recalled that "the 
first exhibition was free and 
hardly anyone came; the next 
year wecharged ten cents and we 
had a number of people; and the 
third year we charged $1.00 for 
the opening night and the crowd 
was all we could accommodate." 

The Fort Wayne ArtSchool was 



officially taken as the name of 
the organization in 1897 with J 
Ross McCuUoch as the first 
president of the new Board of 
Control. 

The Hamilton property was 
purchased for the new Fort 
Wayne High School, so the art 
school moved into new quarters 
in 1903. The two-story brick 
residence at the northeast comer 
of Wayne and Webster Streets, 
former home of Peter Kiser, was 
remodeled and served as 
headquarters until 1922. 

Theodore F. Thieme, head of 
the Wayne Knitting MUls, 
collector and patron of the arts, 
donated his home, as well as 
$10,000 and ten paintings in 1921. 
With the gift, however, came a 
series of stipulations designed to 
put the school on a more stable 
foundation. These included a 
minimum membership of 200, an 
annual fundof not less than $1500, 
the raising of a general fund of 
$25,000, and the committment to 
the development of a museum. 

March 4, 1922, in the 
auditorium of the Fort Wayne 
High School, the constitution and 
bylaws of the Fort Wayne Art 
School and Museum were 
adopted. A board of directors was 
elected, with Albert H. Schaaf as 
president, and Theodore Thieme 
as honorary president. In May, 
Karl S. Bolander became the first 
director. 

The Thieme home, which still 



bouses the art school, was built in 
1898. It was extensively 
remodeled and renovated, and 
the auditorium was added as a 
Little Theatre. The formal 
opening took place in March. 1923 
with a week of celebrations and 
an exhibition of the works of 
Hocsierarbsts. 

Other property adjacent to the 
Thieme home was acquired over 
the years as it t&gt;ecame available, 
so that the school saw a gradual 
expansion. In November, 1949. B. 
Paul Mossman donated his home 
on the corner of West Wayne and 
College Streets, which became 
the home of the art museum until 
last year when it was moved into 
its new quarters on Main Street. 

The name of the organization 
was changed once again in May, 
1966 to The Fort Wayne Art 
Institute, Inc., but the school 
relinquished its membership and 
separated from the museum of 
art when it merged with IPFW in 
1976. 

The tustory of the present 
department of fine arts is one of 
quality leading to growth and 
expansion. The future now 
depends upon the state 
legislature. Although the star- 
ving artist hard at work in^a 
leaky garrett is a romantic 
image, it has little to do with the 
realities of a demanding new 
world of art which requires 
knowledge of the expanding 
resources of technology.

Basketball first intercollegiate sport 



ByTAMIRICE 
Staff wrlter 

They didn't have a name. They 
didn't have a gymnasium, a 
statistician, or a manager, but 
they had a game to play so they 
got the ball and fought. These 
were some of the circumstances 
in which the IPFW basketball 
team made their debut as an 
intercollegiate team in 1968. 

Basketball. at an in- 



tercollegiate level of com- 
petition, finally got on its feet at 
IPFW after four years as an 
intramural sport There were 
many problems in establishing 
an intercollegiate sport. The 
largest was the fact that the 
NCAA might not allow the 
facility to field a team composed 
of students from both univer- 
sities. Other problems included 
financing the team, finding 
coaches, and building an athletic 



center. Not to mention the fact 
that they had no mascot. 

The teams first coach, Ed 
Leonard, said in the February 
1968 edition of The Com- 
municator (then called Student- 
Exponent) that the purpose of the 
program is to provide the 
regional campus with a spectator 
sport that offers spirited com- 
petition at an intercollegiate 
level, and to offer hope to those 



seeking NCAA recognition. 
Coach Leonard was assisted by 
current athletic director Dave 
Skelton. 

Funded by student activity fees 
and still no mascot or nickname, 
IPFW got its first taste of 
competition against Inter- 
national College, losing 109-92,

season of play defeating Raywell

record. The game was played 



Student Senate has come a long way 



By CHRISTINA MERCER 
SUrr writer 

The main purpose of the IPFW 
Students' Senate is to "provide a 
voice for the student body," said 
Don Gomey, student body 
president. "It effects policy 
change by letting the ad- 
ministration know how the 
student feels." 

Students' government has the 
power to influence the ad- 
ministration by passing 
resolutions and voicing its 
feelings in standing committees. 

"It (students' government) has 
significant influence, in the short 
and long range," said John 
Ulmer, dean of students services. 

Students' government has its 
greatest impact through 
university-wide committees 
which students serve on, Ulmer 
said. Students, who are appointed 
by the president of students 
government, are members of 
standing committees such as the 



University Resource and Policy 
Committee, the Honors Council, 
the Student Affairs Committee of 
the Faculty Senate and the 
Traffic Appeals Board. 

Students' government was Hrst 
organized in 1964 and it was 
called the student assembly. 

The assembly was organized to 
inform the faculty and the ad- 
ministration needs of the 
students. 

Another purpose of the 
assembly was to approve new 
organizations on the campus. In 
Nov. 1965 the assembly approved 
the establishment of fraternities 
and sororities at IPFW. 

In 1966 the assembly created 
the student union board. SUB was 
added to the government body to 
provide a well-rounded program 
of social and cultural activities 
for students. 

In the early 70's the student 
assembly changed its name and 
students' government became 



two bodies. It became the 
student senate and the student 
union board of governors. 

Students' government has 
helped students in many ways 
over the past 20 years. 

Since the beginning, students' 
government has been working to 
supply students with adequate 
parking. In Nov. 1968 it requested 
that handicapped parking be 
expanded and wheelchair ramps 
installed on campus. 

"We have been very vocal in

Students' government supports 
the Child Care Center, the Job 
Location Service and the 
Transitional Tutoring Center. 

Students' government sup- 
ported the need for Personal 
Psychological Counseling and 
Transitional Studies for 
Educational Disadvantaged 
Students. It also enabled the 
Disabled Student Services to get 



started. 

In the past, it supported car 
pooling and free legal advice for 
shjdents but these programs 
were discontinued. 

Car pooling "died of lack of 
interest," said Ulmer. "It was 
faddish." 

The free legal advice prc^ram 
ended because it wasn't helping 
students anymore, said Gomey. 

"At first it was active," said 
Gorney, but the "last couple of 
years we were acting as a 
middle-man, referring students 
to lawyers." 

The money supporting these 
campus organizations and ser- 
vices is raised through a student 
activity fee. The students' 
government recommends and 
Purdue University approves the 
amount of money a full-time 
student pays for the activity fee. 

In 1968, the activity fee was $3. 
In 1968 the fee was raised to$15 to 
provide more activities and

services for students. It was 
raised again three years ago and 
now costs full-time students $20. 

Twenty years ago students' 
government could not allocate 
money and it was supervised by 
the faculty. The money raised 
from the student activity fees 
was allocated by the staff 
allocation board. Over the years 
students' government has gained 
power to allocate money to the 
organizations funded by the 
activity fee. 

Students' government has been 
involved in many aspects of 
improving IPFW, 

In 1982 and 83 the senate was 
very active with the Library 
Endowment Fund, a project to 
raise money for new books 
needed at the Helmke Library. 
The Senate got students involved 
in the drive to update Helmke 
Library and raised several 
thousand dollars from students, 
Gorney said.

MULTIPURPOSE BUILDING 



Athletic facilities to meet the needs of most 
recreational and physical fitness enthusiasts 

Featured in the Multipurpose Building are five 
racquetball-handball courts, three full-size 
basketball courts, an indoor jogging track, and 
a weight room. In addition, facilities for indoor 
tennis, volleyball, gymnastics, wrestling, condi- 
tioning, and dancing are also available.
