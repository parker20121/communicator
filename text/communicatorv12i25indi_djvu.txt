Plans to use leverage 



Senate votes 



By JIM CHAPMAN 

Chief Reporter 

A proposed four-year engineering 

degree, a proposed "late" calendar for 

1982-83, and a subscription to the 

National On-Campus Report were the 

topics at hand when the Student Senate 

met March 18. 

Senators Bob Griebel and Tom Harris 



proposed a resolution (o conduct a 
letter writing campaign in support of a 
four-year engineering degree program 
here. 

The Senate voted to conduct the letter 
writing campaign to urge the approval 
of a proposed Bachelor of Science 
degree in engineering (see related 
story). 



Group eyes calendar 



By WAYNE STEFFEN 
Staff Writer 

The IPFW Calendar Committee is 
currently discussing whether to con- 
tinue using the present class schedule 
for 1982-83 or change to a "late" 
calendar. 

Using the late calendar, the Fall 
Semester 1982 would begin on Thurs- 
day, Sept. 16 Christmas break would 
be from Dec. 17 to Jap. 3. Finals would 
begin Jan. 17 and the semester would 
end Jan. 21. 

The Spring Semester 1983 would start 
Jan. 31. Spring vacation would be from 
April 1 to April 1 1 and classes would end 
June 3. 

Still open for debate is the scheduling 
of the summer sessions for the late 
calendar proposal. However, the 
present late calendar proposes one 
session running from June 13 to July 22. 

The late schedule has met with op- 
position from at least one member of 
the Calendar Committee, Don Guffey, 
an IPFW student senator and one of two 
students on the nine-memt&gt;er com- 
mittee, opposes the change, 

"Under the late calendar, IPFW 
students would not get into the summer 
job market as quickly as those from 
Bloomington," Guffey said. He fears 
that this would mean a loss of needed 
jobs that could keep many from 
reluming to school in the fall. 

Members of the Calendar Committee 
are Guffey; Don Banning, student; 
Jack C. Dahl, professor; Bruce Franke, 
professor; Thomas Guthrie, professor; 
Kenneth Keller, professor; Mark 
Sheldon, professor, and Robert Wise, 
professor. The committee Is chaired by 
Michael Downs, professor. 

Guffey said he is worried about more 
than student convenience. "I'm afraid 
that there is some political pressure 
being put on officials of this campus, 
perhaps even from Bloomington," he 
said. 

Any allegations of this kind are 
quickly denied by Downs, 

"In the 10 years I have been on the 
committee, I can't remember a single 
time that we have paid any attention to 
what Bloomington may have said or 
done," said Downs, 

"This is entirely a campus 
prerogative. We discuss various types 
of calendars every year. Be they 
quarters, tri-meslers, or whatever," 
Down told the Communicator, 

"If students don't want this schedule, 
it won't happen," Guffey said. 

"We need student support The 
commiKee will meet again on April 9

and I'd like lo go in there with some 
input on this issue," Guffey said. 

Some think that the late calendar will 
lead to a less harried time at the end of 
the fall semester, when term papers 
and exams often corneal the same time 
that students are making holiday plans. 
Also, spring break would fall in the 
middle of the semester, breaking up the 
period between the Christmas and 
spring holidays. 

As for the summer job market. 
Downs said. "The supporters of the late 
schedule say that because we are 
basically a commuter college, perhaps 
75 percent of the students already have 
jobs." 

"1 am the one who, in 1967, first 
proposed the calendar we now have. It 
was fought then because no one else 
was doing it at the time," Downs said. 

"All we have agreed to do is put the 
two schedules side- by -side and look at 
them and discuss them freely," Downs 
said. 



IPFW prepared for fires 



By KAROLHEHBER 
Chief Reporter 

In the past six months there have 
been false tire alarms here— all set off 
by accident. 

Maurice Shady, chief of University 
Police and Safety, said he feels some 
people don't seem to take the alarm 
seriously when they hear it. When an 
alarm went off last fall, he received 
several phone calls asking him to turn 
the annoying thing oft. Thse people 
never knew for sure whether there was 
a fire or not, he said. The real danger 
could occur if and when an actual fire 
happens and some make the fatal 
mistake of not believing It, he added. 

There has never been a major fire at 
IPFW. lijrecent years, this campus has 
only had to deal with minor fires or 
smoke related emergencies, never with 
a large evacuation of the buildings. 

Is our university properly equipped to 
handle major fire emergencies and 
evacuations? 

In accordance with Indiana statutes, 
ell university buildings must be 
equipped with pull fire alarms, heat 
and smoke sensors and fire ex- 
tinguishers. Part of Neff Hall, all of 
Helmke Library, Walb Memorial Union 
and the new buildings under con- 
struction also have or will have 
sprinkler systems installed, Keltlcr 
Hall has no sprinkler system because it 
was constructed before sprinklers were 
required. Jolin CarnaglU, Vice Chan- 
cellor of Financial Affairs at IPFW, 
said it wasn't economically feasible at 
this lime to install sprinkler systems in 
I Kettler because of the large cost in- 
volved. 

The university has updated Its 1977 
manual onemcrgency information with 
a policies and procccdures booklet 
Issued Jan. 15. isni. It has been 
distributed to all university employees 
who should be acquainted with its 
contents in the event of an emergency. 



Posted near the doorway in each 
classroom are fire evacuation in- 
structions. Students are to familiarize 
themselves with the procedures and are 
supposed to be notified of this in- 
formation by the classroom instructor. 

IPFW is inspected on a regular basis 
through an agency working out of 
Lafayette in connection with the 
Occupational Safet&gt;' and Health Act 
(OSHA), Shady said. This agency 
ehecljs tor possible fire hazards, safety 
regulations, faulty wiring and other 
related matters under this act. The 
campus, too, checks its own alarms and 
extinguishers twice a year tor ef- 
fectiveness, he said. 

During a recent visit to the campus, 
the Fort Wayne Fire Department found 
the PIT workshop in violation of several 
fire regulations. Piles of lumber were 
strewn about, cigarette bulls were 
near flammable paint cans, celling tiles 
were out of place and faulty wiring was 
found on the stage area. Shady said all 
violations have been corrected. 

According to Chief Robert McMahon 
of the Fire Prevention Bureau of Fort 
Wayne, IPFW adheres to the required 
fire codes set up by state laws and tries 
to comply with the guidelines on 
building safety suggested by the 
National Fire Protection Association. 
The bureau periodically checks this 
campus and other public buildings 
looking for violations of these codes. 

McMahon admitted, however, that 
due to the limited funds and manpower 
in the bureau, the bureau cannot In- 
spect all buildings as frequently as it 
would like to. 

Shady said IPFW is exempt from fire 
drills and that it "isn't feasible" for a 
campus like this one to give them. 
"We'd have to have one every hour," he 
said, to effectively test student 
response because of the Irregularity of 
each person's schedule. 



Senators Don Guffey and Don Ban- 
ning originated a resolution to urge the 
University Calendar Committee to 
reject the late calendar being proposed 
for the 19B2-83 school year and accept 
the formula proposed calendar (see 
related story). The resolution was 
passed by the Senate. 

A subscriptton to the National On- 
Campus Report was approved by the 
Senate in its final business of the 
session. It was decided to allocate $38 
from the Students' Government office 
account for the subscription because 
the publication contains information 
about legislative Issues, said Bob 
Griebel, who proposed the allocation 
request.

4-year engineering degree in works 



By JIM CHAPMAN 
CUef Reporter 

A proposal is being considered for a 
four year Bachelor of Science Degree in 
engineering. 

During its March 18 meeting, the 
Student Senate resolved to conduct a 
letter writing campaign aimed at the 
Commissioners for Higher Education. 
state legislatures from the Fort Wayne 
area, and others who could help in 
securing the proposed degree. 

In the resolution, the Senate cited 
three reasons for helping out the 
Engineering, Technology, and Nursing 
deparbnent: 

First of all. Fort Wayne and north- 
eastern Indiana do not have a state 
supported degree program in 
engineering. 

Secondly the Fort Wayne and north- 
eastern area is based heavily on 
industry where an on-going supply of 
engineers is necessary. 

Thirdly, tlie supply of engineers 
needed in the Fort Wayne and 
northeastern area is not being met by 
any local or area institution of higher 
education 

Purdue University, West Lafayette 
has given the OK for IPFW to have a 
tour year engineering degree, but the 
final decision will come from the 
Commission for Higher Education: i 
John F, Dalphin, dean of the 
engineering, teiihnology, and nursing 
department feels that there could be 



some polities that will be involved in the 
final decision. 

"I hope the issue will be determined 
on the basis of (ullfulling needs rather 
than on political questions. So much is 
political." Dalphin said. 

On Mardi 13. a Purdue represen- 
tative gave a presentation at the 
Indiana Commission for Higher 
Education for IPFW's request for the 
degree. Dalphin feels that not enough 
time was given tor- the Purdue 
reprtsentative lo make his presen- 
tation (45 minutes was allowed for 
discussion about Purdue engineering in 
the state in general and the IPFW 
proposal). 

During the 45 minutes, presentations 
were also given by Tri State University. 
Indiana Institute of Technology, 
Magnavox, ITT, and Indiana and 
Michigan Electric Company, Dalphin 
said. 

According to Dalphin, IPFW's 
biggest hurdle is Tri State, who does not 
want IPFW's request met because it 
feels IPFW engineering students will 
decrease the enrollment of Tri State 
engineering students. 

Dalphin also stated that Tri State 
professors have offered to come to 
IPFW and teach engineering courses to 
enable students to finish out their junior 
and senior years. They would receive 
Tri Slate engineering credits and 
eventually a Tri State engineering 
degree. 



Dalphin made It clear the 
engineering, technology, and nursing 
department does not want Tri State 
professors coming to IPFW to teach 
engitieering courses and the depart- 
ment also disagrees that the proposal, 
if approved, will decrease Tri State's 
enrollment. 

"Tht department feels that the 
clientele is different here at IPFW than 
that of Tri State so that there will be 
littleornoeffect," Dalphin said. 

Dalphin slated that although Tri 
Slate is against IPFW's proposal, 
Magnavox here in Fort Wayne, is for it. 

Ken Lewis, manager of compensation 
and training at Magnavox. gave a 
presentation during the allowed 45 
minutes of discussion at the Com- 
mission for Higher Education's 
meeting. 

According to Dalphin, Lewis said that 
there is a need for engineers on the 
local and national levels and that lie 
endorses IPFW's proposal. 

Dalphin said that the engineering 
department has been trying to receive 
the four year degree for seven years. 
Engineering students can presently 
complete their first two years in the 
engineering program here at IPFW. 
This period can be lengthened or 
shortened by one year depending on the 
disciphiTC and the student's interest, he 



said. 

IPFW's request for the tour year 
degree was rejected in 1977. According 
to Dalphin, one of the perceived 
problems was that the proposed four 
year degree would decrease IIT's 
enrollment. At the present, Dalphin 
feels that there is no longer a problem

"I think the commission realizes that 
IIT does not fulinil part-time 
engineering students' needs and that 
the institute is not ABET 
(Accreditation Board for Engineering 
andTechnologyi accredited. 

Dalphin said that IPF^V must receive 
its four year degree and have some 
students graduate before it can be 
ABET accredited. ABET sets stan- 
dards that engineering programs 
should meet and also evaluates whether 
or not the programs meet the stan- 

Dalphin also stated that lUPUI's 
and Purdue Calumet's engineering 
departments and some ot their 
technology departments are ABET 
accredited. 

The engineering, technology, and 
nursing department will not know if 
their request is met until April 10, when 
the Commission for Higher Education 
meets in the Purdue Calumet region, 
according to Dalphin.

IPFW hosted its first State and Peace 
Oratory contest on Monday, March 23, 
IPFW students Lynda Hatfield and Jill 
Kemp placed fourth and fifth, 
, respectively, in the finals for the State 
part of the contest. 

IPFW was Ihe only school to place 
more than one speaker in any division. 

Julie Becker, from Butler University, 
and Timothy Hattner, from Wabash 
College, won first and second place. 
respectively, in the State division, They 
will travel lo St, Olaf's College in 
Northtield, Minnesota on May l and 2 
for the National State contest. 

Speeches in the State division cen- 
tered on persuasive topics. The winning 
speech from Becker dealt with 
chemical pollution and its danger to 
society. 

In the Women's Peace Oratory 
division, Sandra Smith from IPFW 
captured second place with her speech 
on nonviolent oolitics. First place went 



to Malani Janakaramin from lU South 
Bend. 

Bruce Mercer won second place with 
his speech entitled "Symbol of Peace." 
First place went to John Roth from 
Goshen College. 

First place winners in the Peace 
divisions will have their speeches taped 
and the tapes will be sent to Northfield 
to be judged in the National Peace 
division contest. 

This is the last year for both Men's 
and Women's Peace divisions. The 
Forensic constitution has been changed 
so that next year the Peace Oratory will 
be made up of just onesection. 

Janet Roncelli, faculty organizer for 
the Slate meet, was recognized at the 
contest as being in charge of what was 
said lo be the most organized state 
meet within the last ten years. She at- 
tribuled die good organization to an 
acfive Forensic League. The Forensic 
League's active participation is 
possibly the reason \vhy IPFW was able 
tohost the contest, she said 



Alleged lack of organization prompts petition; 
29 computer technology students attack course 



ByKIMKUZEFF 
Managing Editor 

Dissatisfaction with an advanced 
computer technology course and its 
professor prompted a pefition by 
students to that department's chair- 
person and other administra tors. 

Twenty-nine students — about half of 
those enrolled in CIS271, Applications 
Software Project — contended m a 
petition dated Feb. 4 that Dorothy Coon, 
assistant professor of computer 
technology, was "inadequately 
organized and prepared for her 
classes." 

The petition staled that "an example 
of this lack is apparent in the payroll 
project which was distributed at tire 
end of the second week of classes," a 
project which was "in no way 
operational," 

Shirley Syster, one of the students 
who organized the petition drive. 
submitted copies of the petition to 0. 
Frankhn Kenworthy, assistant vice- 
chancellor and assistant dean of the 
faculty, who said he distributed copies 
to Edward Nicholson, vice- chancel lor 
and dean of the faculty: John Dalphin, 
dean of engineering, technology, and 
nursing; and Spotswood Stoddard, 
chairperson of the computer technology 
department, Stoddard denied receiving 
a copy of the petition, though he said he 
knew of it. 

Nicholson and Stoddard admitted 
there were problems in Ihe computer 
technology department before the 
petition surfaced, and Stoddard said 



action lo resolve the problems was 
being taken before the petition was ever 
distributed. 

None of the administrators would 
comment on the nature ot the problems. 

Coon said concerns in the petition 
were "outdated" and had been solved 
since she returned on March IB from a 
month-long sick leave. She would not 
disclose the nature of her illness. 

Coon, who has taughlat IPFW for two 
years, contended "many of the students 
panicked too soon and didn't ask 
questions. They got together and 
figured it was worse than it really was 
and initialed the petition," 

Coon said Ihe COBOL course "was 
very well planned," and that "it is 
proceeding exactly as planned. The 
lectures needed for the program were 
given before the students started the 
program," shesaid, 

"The program was a simulation of an 
actual commercial or industrial 
situation," said Coon. "The problems 
were fully intended tobe in there." 

Stoddard agreed. "Much of the 
criticism in Ihe petition is crificism of 
the academic structure ot the course 
that was put there on purpose. It is not 
the student's prerogative to determine 
what's in the course, but the faculty's 
and the university's," he said- 
University policy dictates that 
complaints be channeled from the 
instructor of the class in question, to the 
chairperson of the department, to the 
dean ot the school, ending finally at the 
desk ot the vice-chancellor and dean of 
the faculty. Kenworthy. Nicholson, and 



Dalphin said Syster should have taken 
this route before initiating the petition, 
which Stoddard called "a non- 
constructive form of criticism. " 

Syster said she did take the 
prescribed channels ot complain! 
before initiating Ihe petition. Sheand at 
least one other student conferred with 
Coon and Stoddard, and Syster talked to 
Dalphin about the class before sending 
out the pefition, she said. During tier 
second visit with Kenworthy. Syster 
gave him copies of the petition to 
distribute to other administrators. 

Four students who signed the petition 
— including two who work with com- 
puters professionally — cited several 
specific concerns about Coon and her 
class. 

Syster said that when Coon was there, 
"95 percent of the classes were not on 
COBOL, but more on revision than 
learning." She said the main problems 
were a combine tionot a lack ot lectures 
and background material to enable the 
class to do the payroll project and 
general disorganization. 

Coon said "there were not very many 
modifications in the program — no 

"There's mass contusion in the 
class." said Syster, "She doesn't know 
what she wants. Coon clianges her mind 
from day to day. . . She didn't even run 
the program herself to sec if it would 
work." 

Another student who signed the 
petition. Ken Hampshire, a 
professional computer programmer tor 



I &amp; M, was bothered by "a lot of am- 
biguity in the course." He said Coon 
"had a problem relating what she 
wants done. My real complaints are 
with the leaching of the course," said 
Hampshire. "It's very simplistic." 
Hampshire said Itiat students are 
coming to him tor help because of his 
background In computers, 

Pam Dancer and Dale Best also 
signed the petition. 

Best, a programmer analyst, said 
"last year Coon's lectures consisted ot 
reading out ot the book. This year, she 
gave two lectures When asked in-depth 
questions, she'd usually have to go to 
someone else. Someone leaching 
COBOL should know most of the an- 
swers." said Best. 

Coon contended she "knows COBOL 
quite well" 

Dancer agreed with Best about the 
problems. She said Coon also gave 
different information to the day and 
night classes, making it more con- 
fusing. 

"We're left on our owa" Dancer said. 
"She's certainly not teaching. She 
teaches the course by giving us a twok 
and saying we're on our own, but we 
don't have lime to read the book 
because we're too busy working on the 
program I'm spending between 20 and 
30 hours a \veek lor this two-credit 
course, and doing about three times as 
much work for this course than lor a 
three-credit course," Dancer said, "It's 
so disorganized thai w..- don't know 
what they really wini until iheduedate 
forlheprosTamispasl. "

Calendar OK 



;Each year a calendar commillee is 
selected In set up Ihe IPFW schedule of 
classes for Ihe following year 

This year's commillee, chaired by 
Michael Downs, head of Ihe pohlical 
science department, is considering two 
proposed schedules for (he 1982-83 
academic year 

Jhe first is the present class schedule; 
Ihe second a "laie" calendar 

Powns, who first proposed the 
academic calendar now in use, has said 
it is usual for the commillee lo consider 
mpre than one schedule Downs has 
served on the commillee for 10 years. 

He also said the commillee has only 
agreed lo look al Ihe two schedules side- 
by-side, objectively, and discuss them 
freely. 

Advocates of returning lo the late 
schedule— it was the one used here 
before 1967— think students have an 
advantage by having Christmas break 
fall before the end of the semester. It 
allows, they say, time for students to 
study for finals -ind prepare final term 
papers. 

Proponents of the late schedule also 
contend it is belter because spring 
break, I9a3, would fall in the middle of 
the semester. 

However valid those reasons may be, 
wefind il hard lo believe the committee 
would seriously consider the late 



schedule proposal. 

Although delaying the start of the fall 
semester lo Ihe middle of September 
seems appealing to those who dislike 
attending classes when it's still warm 
enough outside to continue most sum- 
mertime activities, il is equally unap- 
pealing to remain in class until the 
second week of June when another 
summer is well underway. 

As for the delaying of fall semester 
finals until after the Christmas break, 
we don't like the Idea, At present, with 
all fall semester work done and all finals 
taken, students can really takea break— 
a break from studying and all college 
concerns— and recuperate before 
beginnmg Ihe spring term. 

As for a spring break in the middle of 
Ihe semester— il sounds greaL But what 
liinders the planners from placing the 
break in the middle of the semester in 
any proposed plan? 

Finally, we believe getting out of 
classes in early May allows students who 
need summer employment to get into the 
job market early, when more jobs are 
available. 

Every student who cares about the 
scheduling of classes for 1982-83 should 
speak up When the Calendar Committee 
meets again April 9, we want the 
members to know we don't want the late 
schedule.

Root of problems 
in communication 



HiGHER fuft/OM 



Reader inspired by Smith 



Dear Editor, 

I'd jusi like lo say thank 
you to the Women's Studies 
DepL and Hislorj' Depl, for 
making it possible lo hear 
the soft-spoken, outspoken 
Dr. Eleanor Smith, ihe noted 
black hislorjan from Ihe 
University of Cincinnati on 
Tuesday evening, March 10 
1981. 

Her topic. "Clues from the 
Past, Directions for the 
Future," was, in my 
estlmalion, one of the most 
inspirational and in- 
formative speeches I've ever 
heard in a long time from a 
strong black woman! 

It gave me a new sense o( 
pride lo learji that Niinga, - 
an African queen, ruled 
Angola during the fifteenth 
eenturj' and even after the 
age of 80 ruled wnlh great 



agility and skill. 

To add, il wasn't until afler 
her dealh thai the Portugese 
look control. These things 
were never taught to ie in 

Also, I admired her im- 
mensely tor coming out with 
the truth on racism. She 
said, "Whatever is 
necessary, this country does 
whatever it has to do lo 
whatever race of people it 
has to do il lo— drop a l»mb 
on Hiroshima, put all the 
Japanese in concentration 
camps which are still in this 
countr&gt;— the five of them 
are sliil here. There are 
.{dans. I have seen them in 
Washington, and 1 tried to 
get them from my 
congressman and he said 
there was no such Itiing, on 



rhat lo do to blacks if it is a 
matter of survival of the 
fillesl because not one black 
is considered a fittest. 
People don't want lo know 
that." she said, "because it 
makes them uncomfortable 
and they don't believe it and 
they don't want to hear it 
because it means they have 
to change their behavior and 
it's too much trouble to 
change their behavior." 

I say "RIGHT ON" for the 

Irulh because only the truth 
is the key that will be the 
anlidole for the criji^ling . 
disease of racism. And I 
hope that this college will gel 
more black professors to 
come and teach us all about 
our black heritage and be 
role models for our youth.

It is my feeling the root of 
many problems lies in faulty 
communication. And that the 
root of the root lies in the 
difficulties which prevail in 
male-female communi- 
cations. 

Research reveals 

distressing difficulties in 
cross-sex conversations. 
Grave misinterpretations 
and multitude misun- 
derstandings abound. The 
different perspectives and 
attitudes of the sexes result 
in a situation that lead one to 
conclude we actually speak

com- 
munications problems 
tietween the sexes are 
becoming accentuated as 
women are growing more 
defensive and "liberated" 
and as men are feeng more 
misunderstood and 
"threatened." 

The relalionships between 
men and women are in a 
transitional stage — with 
many different types of 
relationships operative. 
Options are available but. of 
course, necessitate mutual 
choices. My impression is 
thai men and women are 
floundering as they seek to 
find a relationship, an op- 
fion, a communication 
pattern that works for them 
as a couple, pair, or team. 

There seems lo be a strong 
degree of distrust between 
the sexes and more than a 
slight defensiveness on both 



sides. Such abrasivemu 
benefits no one — it buUda 
tjarriers, not bridges. 

I have no answers. I only 
seek lo find them. Those of 
you who also sedt, or have 
found, answers are urged to 
share your experiences: 

1 . Are you having difficulty 
in your communications with 
the other sex? 

2. Whatis the nature of this 
difficulty? 

3 What do you perceive u 
the possible cause? 

4. What possible soluHons 
have you cried? With what 
result? 

5 What do youihink could 
help you improve your 
communications with the 
other sex?

what do you attribute yam- 
success?

Dear Editor: 

Recently as a result of a 
panel project in Com- 
munication 315, "Com- 
munieolion of Technical 
Information," we learned 
some disturbing news. We 
were informed thai in 1970 
when IPFW had 6,000 
sludenls, the campus police 
force consisted of six of- 
ficers. In 1981 with over 
10.000 students, the campus 
police force remains atsix in 
number. Further, we 
discovered that there is only 
one patrol car. 

Vice Chancellor Camaghi 
told one of our group that he 
will be proposing that an 
additional officer beadded lo 
the force and that a second 
car be added. With the ad- 
dition of Ihe responsibility 
for security for two new 
buildings in the near future, 
we Ihink an additional of- 
ficer may be warranted; but 
do we need another car?

In dire financial limes 
suchasours, shouldn't we be 
Uiinking creatively? WE 
ANSWER- -YES." 

To Ihe administration of 
IPFW we say, "Get a 
Horse!" Better yet, "Get 
rwo Horses!" 

We Ihink thai the 'Horse 
Power" problem confronted 
by our campus police can be 
solved with a mounted 
patrol. Below are several 
advantages to such an ap- 
proach which are offered in 
random order without 
priority. We think the ad- 
vantages of a horse patrol 
far exceed anything 
produced in Japan, Bonn, or 
Detroit. Those advantages 

1. Increased visibility for 
the officer on polrol, 

2. Better health for the 
officer who has to mount and 
dismount to write tickets. 

3. Providing someone 



(animal lovers always al- 

Iribule human charac- 
leristics to Iheir pets&gt; for ihe 
officer to love and care for. 

4. Belter overall mobilily 
on campus. 

5. Probably cheaper Ihan 
the upkeep on the current 
mode of transportation — 
Vice Chancellor Carnaghj 
may have to do a cost study 
lo determine Ihe merit of Ihis 
one. 

6. A ready source of fer- 
tilizer for the increased 
effort at campus 
bcaulification. 

7. A ready source of 
biodegradable material for 
allemale fuel research 
projects for the School of 
Nursing. Engineering and 
Technology, and the 
Department of Biological 
Sciences, and the Depart- 
ment of Chemistry. 

8. The officers and Iheir 
mounts could provide "pony 



rides" at the "Penny Car- 
nival" and the "Johnny 
Apples eed Festival," 

9, The officers who fancy 
themselves as urban 
cowboys wouldn't have lo 
trust the operator of Ihe 
mechanical bull at The 
Cowboy, 

10. A new administrative 
post would have lo be 
crealed for Ihe official 
campus poopor scooper. 

We challenge others who 
are inleresled in a better 
IPFW campus to engage in 
some creative thinking and 
join our cause to resolve the 
problem of a lack of horse 
power on campu.s.

Smith talks on black roles in history 



PAGE4-THE COMMUNICATOR -MAKCH26, 1981 



BvCHEHVL GIBSON 
Chief (leporier 
Networking and sislcrhood 
were Ihe key words in a 
lecture given by Eleanor 
Smith, professor of Afro- 
American studies at (he 
University of rincinnati, al a 
recent Women's Studies 
meeting here. 

Smith hss extensive 
publication in black studies, 
with her main topic black 
women. She is also a 
member of several 
organizations for blacks and 

She began her quest for 
knowledge about black 
women in history 15 years 
ago while teaching sixth 
grade in Worlhinglon, Ohio. 
Black history has been "a 
savior of my soul,'" said 



Smith. 'When the school 
wanted to do a unit on black 
liistory. Smith was selected 
for the project She has since 
received her PhD in African 
Studies, 

■'Clues From the Past: 
Direction in the Future," 
was the title of Smith's 
lecture. A crowd of over 100 
people gathered to hear the 
lecture on black women and 
their roles in history She 
traced the lifestyle of black 
women from the African 
queens, who united coun- 
tries, stimulated dress 
codes, and were honored like 
goddesses, through slavery 
and up to the present .. 

She said 21 percent of all 
blacks live in poverty, and 
by the end of the century, 
half of the black families will 



be headed by women. She 
said drugs, alcohol, and 
teenage pregnancies are 
part of the problems facing 
blacks. 

Understanding the past 
will help family relations, 
said Smith. "We never live 
for tomorrow, we only live 
for today." she said in trying 
to persuade the audience to 
thinknftheirfuture. 

She said if each black 
woman became a mentor to 
two other black women, 
together they coutd form a 
network. She believes rote 
models are essential to black 
women. Networking is done 
better in small groups said 
Smith. "It stimulates risk 
taking — not just giving, but 
taking help." 

"It is not too late to learn 
the history — bathe in being

black." she said. Smith feels 
it is very important to team 
about their social heritage 
and to teach the young. 

The problem is most 
blacks do not know their 
heritage or how powerful 
black women like the 
African queens were during 
tlieir reign. 

One problem facing the 
audience was how to educate 
youth. Smith suggested one 
solution was for the family to 
get together and talk for 30 
minutes each day. Another 
solution was an "after- 
school" school where blacks 
could be taught their culture, 
similar to the Freedom 
School in the '705. 

Another main concern was 
how to network and with 
whom Smith explained 
networking as relating and 
expressing political, social 
and job skills and creating a 
strong bond of sisterhood. 

"We talk too much," said 
Smith, "we need to listen and 
feel. Let's hope tlie future 
wilt be brighter "

Soar into the heart and 

mind of Emily Slilson. Suffer 
with her; rejoice with her; 
laugh with her; cry with her: 
in "Wings." 

Arthur Kopit's "Wings," 
which plays through March 
29 at the First Presbytei'ian 
Theatre, poignantly tells the 
turbulent slory of Mrs. 
Stilson, who is tragically 
afflicted with a stroke and 
concurrent aphasia. 

Alone in her thoughts, 
struggling and trapped, Mrs. 
Stilson tries to understand 
the nonsense world into 
which she has been cast. She 
frequently returns, in 
thought, to her youtli, when 
she walked (he wings of stunt 
planes. It was on those wings 
where she felt free and at 
peace, and it is through a 
return to that peace that she 
finds a release from her 
frustration. 



Emily Slilson is 
beautifully played by the 
competent Mary Varnelle, 
who brings to the stage 
moving pathos and charm- 
ing bits of sarcasm. She is 
an accomplished actress 
who can carry this show with 
the demands it imposes. She 
is truly outstanding. 

The character who 
provides the greatest sup- 
port for Mrs. Stilson is her 
young aide, played ef- 
fectively by Molly McCray. 
The relationship between the 
two women is crucial to the 
play, but it wasn't developed 
as well as it could have been 
— perhaps due to the script. 

The big co-stars on this 
show are the lights and 
sound, which help take the 
audience through the 
bewilderment and panic of 
Mrs. Stilson's mind. The 
lifting was done by David 
Freeman and Jack 
Mulqueen, and the sound 



was done by Arnold Huge 
and Jack Ruhl. Technical 
direction and coordination 
was done by Laurie Weier 
and Herb Weier, and the 
entire production staff is 
certainly to be commended 
for the smooth presentation. 
It took careful, sensitive 
direction to produce this 
play, and John Toltey is 
beWnd ils playing so nicely. 
"Wings" is touching and 
traumatic, sensitive and 



:ary. 



and 



memorable. It frightens and 
it hurts, but it leaches and 
guides. 

It is difficult to com- 
prehend the trauma 
surrounding a condition like 
Emily's, especially for youth 
who have had no contact 
with it, but through this play 
one step closer to un- 
derstanding can be taken. 
Don't be frightened away by 
the theme of "Wings," go 
and learn from it.

struggle to conquer the frustration resulting from a stroke.

Communicator anticipates Oscars 



Rush sounds familiar 



Bv GRETCHEN IIOLODICK 
Staff Writer 

Rush is a bit repetitious, 
and can tend (o ge( on one's 
nerves Though powerful, 
moving, and conceptual, 
when listening to this 
Canadian band one can't 
ever be sure whether to love 
i( or to hale it. 

Nevertheless Rush is here 
and so is its new album 
"Moving Pictures." The 
album is a lot like "Per- 
manent Waves" and 
"Hemispheres." so one 
doesn't have to buy it lo get a 
goodidea what it sounds like. 

"Moving Pictures" is 
definitely a conceptual 
album, or at least in part. It 
runs in basically the same 
formal as "Permanent 
Waves." The music even 
sounds the same in places. 

Some Ihings are different 
through, and "YYZ" is one 



them. This particular 
piece relies totally in Rush's 
instrumentals to get them 
by, since there are no lyrics. 
It really helps the album th- 
ough, and hnally heard is 
Lifeson's masterful guitar 
work and Peant's thun- 
dering, mind boggling drums 
without Lee's vocals con- 
stantly getting in the way. 

The best thing about 
Rush's new album is 
"Limelight," the last song on 
the first side. Finally the 
music changes, not so 
draggy and melodramatic, 
and becomes alive with 
what seems lo be a catchy 
lillle melody. Lee's vocals 
come (o lite again, and are 
snjooth and inspiring. The 
whole song is pumping with 
fresh new soiuid not heard 
from Rush for a long time. 

The first side of "Moving 
Pictures ' is right on target. 



not so with the second side. 
The only thing worth men- 
tioning on (he flip side is 
PearCs lyrics— they are 
profound and quite creative; 
they would do well by 
themselves. The song 
"Witch Hunt" is a perfect 
illustration of this. "Witch 
Hunt" is an eerie analogy of 
ourselves and witch hunters 
of the 1600s, and Peart really 
makes a point well here. 



By MIKE GEFFEN 
Chief Reporter 

Next Monday is the date 
for Hollywood's favorite 
guessing game — the 
Oscars, ft is the single night 
of (he year where a little of 
the pomp and glamour that 
characterized Hollywood in 
the 30s and 40s is broueht 
back, at least for a little 
while. The fact that fewer 
really good films are being 
made each year has made 
the Oscars somewhat 
predictable, and turned the 
event itself into a slightly 
ironic comment on what 
Hollywood once was. 

L^st year was the first 
time that the nominations for 
best picture seemed to be a 
synthesis ot many critics' 
best film lists, something 
unthinkable five years ago. 

The trend has continued 
this year since "Raging 
Bull," "Ordinary People," 
. "Coal Miner's Daughter,"" 
"The Elephant Man," and 
"Tess," this year's nominees 
tor best picture, have ap- 
peared on the average film 
critic's ten best list. The 
merge of the critics with the 
mainstream of Hollywood 
system is interesting, and 
has taken some of (he 
mystery out ot (he Oscars. 

Having said that they are 
predictable, 1 will now delve 
into my crystal l»a!l, consult 
the Oscar which has been 
lying on Price-Waterhouse's 
porch since noon today, and 
predict what the Academy 
will choose on Monday. 

The Best Picture race will 



Committee solicits artwork 



be a close one between 
"Raging Bull" and 
"Ordinary People." The 
others don'( have a chance. 
On the surface, it may seem 
that the two films don't have 
anything in common, one 
t&gt;eing a subtle story about a 
family's disintegration, and 
the other a violent cha racier 
study, but there are more 
similarities than one might 
suspect. Both films do 
something films rarely do, 
they create a total screen 
environment tor their 
characters. The total im- 
mersion the audience feels in 
these films is what makes 
them flawless and why both 
deserve an Oscar. 

It's a hard choice between 
the two, almost like flipping 
a coin, but I think that 
"Ordinary People" will win. 
It's less flashy than "Bull," 
and it deals realistically with 
a "message," and the 
Academy likes "message" 
films. 

For the Best Actor 
category, there is simply no 
contest, DeNiro will win 
hands down. His per- 
formance dominates 
"Raging Bull" from 
twginning to end. and the 
subtlety of his performance 
is part ot (he film's subtlety. 
DeNiro creates a character 
of such overpowering force 
that we leave "Bull" dazed 
and wondering how a person 
like that exists. A per- 
formance that powerful 
simply can't be overlooked. 

The Best Actress category 
is the toughest one to predict 
because the race between 
Sissy Spacek in "Coal

Miner's Daughter" and 
Mary Tyler Moore in 
■'Ordinary People" is too 
close to call. Both per- 
formers dominated the 
scenes they are in, and give 
superb performances, 

Spacek is really the only 
reason that "Daughter" 
hangs together, and the only 
reason we forgive the film's 
lamentable lapse into cliches 
in its second half. For 
making us care about her 
character in a film full of 
cliches she deserves an 
award. 

Moore might beat hci 
because of a dynamic per- 
formance and her courage in 
playing against type. The 
only reason Moore mighl no( 
win is the Academy's 
reluctance to vole for 
someone who has never 
acted in a film before. Both 
performances are so strong 
that 1 hesitate even to make 
a prediction in this category. 
However, I will go wi(h my 
gut reaction and say (hat 
Moore will win. 

The Best Supporting Actor 
category is tough because it 
is something of a mystery. 
Some critics are predicting 
that the Hutton-Hirsch vote 
for "People" will split (hat 
film's chances in this 
category. That should leave 
either Joe Pesci in "Raging 
Bull" or Jason Robards in 
"Melvin and Howard" to 

I'm not sure if the 
"People" vote will spht like 
that, and Mutton seems to be 
the odds on favorite to win 
this category. However, this 



performance is anything but 
a supporting actor per- 
formance, and though his is 
at the core o[ the film, Joe 
Pesci's performance might 
win simply because it 
matches the in(ensity of 
DeNiro's, For this reason 
alone he deserves the Oscar, 
and I will go with the long 
shot in this category and say 
(hat Pesci will win. If he 
doesn't, Hutton will. 

For Supporting Actress it 
will either by Mary Steen- 
burgen for "Melvin and 
Howard" or Eva La 
Gallienne for "Resurrec- 
tion," L^ Gallienne might 
win purely for sentimental 
reasons, since she is the 
oldest nominee ever entered 
in (his ea(egory. and the 
award would be a career 
award. 



However, 1 (hink it will go 
to Stecnburgcn for her 
marvelous performance. 
Rarely has the screen seen 
such a combination of comic 
and subtly dramatic 
elements fused in one per- 
formance, Stecnburgen is a 
combinatioTi of Judy 
Holliday and Jean Arthur, 
Her performance perfectly 
captures the spirit of the 
American woman who 
consistently yearns for a 
t^etter life. She deserves the 
award. 

Those are my predictions 
for the five major awards. 
Space doesn't permit me lo 
go into the other awards but 
let me quickly stale that I

IPFW into computer boom

Sta(t Writer 

For those who wouldn't 
know a micro&lt;hLp from a 
potato chip, walking into the 
computer room at IPFW can 
be confusing. 

To one side is a room full of 
imposing equipment making 
sclf-imporlant noises. And 
all around are people with 
piles of program sheets, who 
look like they know what 
they'redoing. 

One of these people is 
Dennis Osborn, ad- 
ministrative director of Data 
Programming. 

■'Computers are not 
mysterious black boxes, as 
some people think," Osborn 
said, "and the people who 
run them are not voodoo 
magicians." 

Computers are an ex- 
panding business today and 
those who can operate them 
are in great demand. The 
boom began in the early 
l%os with the development 
of transistors. This allowed 
computers to be mass 



produced, which brought the 
price down. Computers also 
got smaller. 

"In those days if you could 
spell computer you had a 
job," said Osborn. In the 
early '70s, colleges began 
offering degrees in computer 
science and training got 
more sophisticated. 

Osborn sees the growth in 
the field going on "in- 
definitely Look around 
Everyone's life today is 
directly or indirectly 
touched by computer." he 
said. Home and small 
business terminals are 
becoming more and more 
popular. Some retail for as 
little as $400. Osborn said, 
"I've seen some in the trade 
journals as low as $299. " 

So the popularity of par- 
ticular types of expertise 
may vary, but the industry 
as a whole continues to 
mushroom. 

Job placement is carried 
out in various ways. Many 
students find help through 



the Job Placement Center in 
the Walb Memorial Union. 
Companies come to campus 
during Career Days, the last 
of which was held here on 
February Ifi "Sometimes a 
particular company who has 
perhaps hired our graduates 
in (he past will call my office 
to see if. I can recommend 
someone," said Osborn, "We 
have had several years when 
all of our graduates placed in 
jobs before Commence- 
ment" 

IPFW offers both 
associate and bachelor 
degrees in Computer 
Technologj'. "Our system is 
very versatile. We can beat 
any other university our size, 
even though many of them 
have three or four times our 
manpower and budget," said 
Osborn. 

This campus has an "in- 
house" computer, and is 
plugged into Bloomington 
I.U This gives the student 
five computer systems to 



But with all this equipment 
pounding away, why are 
there so many "out of order" 
signs on the terminals? 

"As a conservative figure, 
we have from five hundred to 
twelve hundred people using 
our facilities every day. It 
will be a rare day that 
something doesn't go down 
(become inoperable). 
Usually things get fixed 
pretty quickly, but it can 
take longer if we have to wail 
for parts," said Osborn. 

If a problem does occur, 
the student shouldn't try to 
fix it. The trouble could be 
many things besides the 
terminal itself. The student 
should tell the operator on 
duty, he said. 

But just because a sign is 
on the terminal doesn't mean 
it's broken. "Many times 
someone will put a sign on a 
machine to reserve it," said 
Osborn. "There have been 
times that four terminals 
\vill have out-of-order signs 
but only one will be 
inoperable,"

Campus scratched as site for massive health project 



By SVLVIA OR'nZ 

Staff Writer 
"Focus on Health," a 

community health- screening 
and education project 
scheduled for April E-12 in 
northeasl Indiana and north- 
west Ohio, will be held as 
planned, but the IPFW 
campus will not be one of the 
sites as earlier speculated. 

"We had a large number of 
faculty members who 
agreed to the idea of having 



the campus as a site In fact, 

the idea was very favorably 
received by the facualty," 
remarked Lorainc Hamblin 
from the Office of Univeraily 
Relations. 



"But 



the 



Medical Association of the 
county and the National 
Health Screening Council, 
which is one of the 
organizer of the project. 
were unable to resolve a few 
of their differences and we 
weren't able to locate a 



doctor who would agree to 
act as overseer of the site 
here at the campus," ex- 
plained Hamtilin. 

Invesbgated by WPTA- 
TV. which will sponsor the 
project with the Allen Wells 
Chapter. American Red 
Cross, and the National 
Health Screening Council, 
organizers claim "Focus on 
Health" will be the largest 
volunteer project ever un- 
dertaken in this region. More 
than 120 community groups. 



businesses, and pubhc 
agencies are involved with 
some 2,000 volunteers 
committed to provide 20,000 
volunteer hours of service. 

At 8 press conference held 
earlier, Nancy Pyle, project 
director. estimated the 
project's sites in 13 counties 
will handle up to 12,000 
people. 

Each of the sites wiL be 
staffed with appropriate 
health-care professionals 
and volunteers and wilt 



provide free services and 
tests. All sites will check for 
anemia, obesity. and 
examine vision and blood 
pressure, while some will 
also screen for such ab- 
normalities as glaucoma, 
breast cancer, foot 
problems. sickle cell 
anemia, hearing difficulties, 
oral cancer, and tuber- 
culosis. An additional blood 
chemistry to check for 
diabetes and liver and 
kidney dysfunction will be

"Although the campus will 
not be one of the sites, there 
will still be a number of 
faculty members involved as 
volunteers at other Iticalions 
throughout the community," 
Hamblin said. 

The project will screen 
only persons 18 and older 
because children generally 
have different needs than 
those addressed by the 
screening tests it was noted. 



Journalism program may he possible at lU extensions 



By DARVL S. BR.ANDT 
Copy Editor 

The I.U. School of Jour- 
nalism may soon allow 
IPFW and other regional 
campuses access to its 
stronghold 

The Bloomington school, 
ranked high among J- 
schools nationally and well- 
known for its tough stan- 
dards, is the subject of a 
proposal for system -wide 
establishmenL 

The proposal is a move to 
coordinate the development 



of journalistic education 
throughout the regional 
campuses of lU The 
system -wide school would 
lake responsibility for 
curriculum and faculty. It 
would be based in 
Bloomington and headed by 
a dean who would oversee 
implementation of Us 
programs— for IPFW, this 
concern amounts to a two- 
year transfer program. 

In terms of what it offers 
students at IPFW, the 
proposal IS similar to one 



already under consideration 
here. 

The IPFW proposal, 
drasvn up independently of 
Bloomington's outlines a 
two-year course of stud&gt;' in 
journalism, no degree is 
offered here This transfer 
program emphasizes 
fulfilling the basic 
requirements of an Arts and 
Sciences degree, and offers 
the maximum 12 credit 
hours of journalism trans- 
ferrabte to Bloomington 
Elssentially, it prepares a 
student for entering the 



Bloomington J-schooi as a 

According to Richard 
Gray, director of the I.U. 
School of Journalism, no 
moi'e than the basic two 
years would be offered under 
theproposal Hesaidtheaim 
of the system-wide school 
was to enforce standards in 
curriculum and staffing. He 
cited inexperience in editing 
and inability to type as signs 
of a decrease in quali- 
fications of Bloom- 
ington J-schoot applicants. 



Besides monitoring and 
standardizing the two-year 
programs at regional 
campuses, the system-wide 
School could provide a few 
t&gt;enefits 

The proposal would allow 
for smoother credit transfer, 
and counselling and 
program coordination. An 
effort would be made to 
proiidc workshops and 
clinics. Possibly, special 
scholarships would tie made 
to promising students to 
meet the extra cost of 



transferring to Bloomington. 
Right now the system-wide 
School proposal is being 
looked over by IPFW ad- 
ministrators It is expected 
they will seek deter- 
minations on, and perhaps 
revision of, certain unclear 
policy aspecU of the 
proposal— particularly, 
credit hours assignment, 
and curriculum and faculty 
jurisdiction. As it stands, the 
proposal gives complete 
control over these matters to 
the system-wide school. 




IS IHERE 
LIFE AFTER COLLEGE? 



Sure. But its quality depends on your life during 
college. 

Your college degree and grades are most impor- 
tant. But, in today's competitive job market, you 
may need additional credentials to land the job you 
really want. 

As a sophomore, you need to look ahead. At what 
you can offer an employer. ..your education, work 
experience, leadership abilities. And at how you 
can increase these assets during your last two years 
of college. 

While looking ahead, look at the Army ROTC 
two-year program. Management training. Leader- 
ship experience. Financial assistance. And new op- 
portunities for your life after college as an officer in 
the active Army, Reserve or National Guard.

Math prof perfects audio-tutorial system 



! by CHERYL GIBSON 
' Cbler Reporter 

Rudy Svoboda, associate 
proteuor of mathemallcs at 
IPFW. has spent the past 
four summers researdiing 
and perfecting the audio- 
tutorial system used here. 

"I( Is beyond the ex- 
perimental stage," said 
SvolXKla. The audli&gt;'tub&gt;rial 
tapes can be used in four 
courses. Mill, M112, M153, 
M1S4 with partial tapes 
available (of other sections. 
Currently 440 students, In 
Ihe day and early evening, 
are enrolled in this in- 
Blructlonal mode. 

The research was funded 
(rom four different grants. 
Tht main contributors were 
the Exxon Corporation (or 
fSJ,0O0 and National Science 
Grant for 133,000, Svoboda 
estimated that it costs 
between (40,000 and 150,000 
per course to develop the 



materiBl and hire assistants. 

"Students are coming to 
campus weakly prepared It 
is criminal to put students in 
a class because of a lack of 
background," Svoboda said. 
In the fall placement test, 65 
percent of the students 
placed at the Mill level 
which Is ninth grade 
algebra. 

The tutorial system is 
"extremely valuable for the 
older students and the 
handicapped, it enables 
them to keep working with 
assistance," said Svoboda. 
The system was developed 
by Svoboda to give in- 
dividual teaching that an 
ordinary classroom can not. 

CurrenUy IPFW b theonJy 
campus in the nation that 
teaches math in this man- 
ner, according to Svoboda.

Lafayette. Svoboda then 
used this concept and ap- 
plied it tomathematics. 

Along with the tapes, 
students meet twice a week 



in a classroom setting for 
quizzes and introduction of 

new material. 

Not all course sections are 
offered by tutorial in- 
struction But there are 
benefits for (hose who choose 
the tutorial mode, In the lab 
sessions, peer tutors or in- 
slruclors are available for 
aiding the students. 

The course uses traoklets 
instead of a standard text- 
book. The price of these 
mini-books is considerably 
less than that of the standard 
text. For instance, inFollel's 
the text tor M1S3 isSllJ.75 and 
the booklets cost only M.75. 
Svoboda and his assistants 
have compiled 28-35 miiu- 
series for each course. 

The reason why the 
booklels are sold so cheaply 
is because everything is 
recorded and printed here 
and the university sells it at 



Likewise, the tapes used in 
the courses are made here. 
Svoboda records the 
material on a reel to reel and 
the Learning Resource 
Center (LRCl duplicated 
them on cassette for lab use. 
The LRC can make tapes for 
students' personal use. 

Another benefit of the 
tutorial system is (hat it 
allows students to set their 
own rate of study. The 
course is designed for two 
lessons per week. 

This spring Svoboda plans 
to lake his idea to West 
Lafayette and possibly do a 
field study with the 
remaining money from the 
grants. Svotwda will make a 
few revisions in the course 
but he feels most of the flaws 
have been worked out . 

He sees much paten tjal for 
this type of teaching in other 
colleges and in secondary 
schools. 



Religion, philosophy courses separated 

Philosophy DepL appoints 3 part-time faculty 



By J(H1N GLASSOCK 
atari Writer 

After years of splltUng 
teaching responsibilities 
between classical philosophy 
and religion courses, the 
[dillosophy department has 
, formally established con- 
,centraUons In both of these 
j areas with separate faculty. 
It has also been able to 
I diversify by offering 
Introduction to Philosophy 
j (P-no) to shjdenU \n local 
high schools. 

I Clark Butler, associate 
I professor of philosophy and 
i department chairperson, 
revealed the appointment of 
three part-time faculty who 
will teach the religion 
curriculum this fall. They 
are Sang Kim, John Ribar, 



and Gyde Holler HI, all of 
whom have secular doc- 
torates in the philosophy of 
religion. 

Kim, from the University 
of Pittsburg, is an associate 
minister for the Korean 
congregation of the First 
Presbytarian Church on 
West Wayne Street. He wiU 
begin this fall with Phil UO. 

Rlbar, from theUniversity 
of Michigan, was formerly a 
full-time faculty memtier at 
Concordia Senior Collie 
unbl it dosed in 1977. He will 
teach Phil 210, Religion of 
Ancient Israel. 

Holler, who has just 
completed his doctoral 
dissertation at Boston 
University, will begin a new 
course, Phil 112, Religion 



and Culture. It will be the 
entry level religion course. 

The new curriculum will 
focus on the study of ritual, 
doctrine, and theology in 
religion. These elements are 
rooted in their appeal to 
tradition, faith, and 
revelation in order to jusbfy 
their existence, Butler said. 
The sociology, psychology, 
and anthropology of religion 
will also be examined. 

The part-time teachers 
will receive S700 to $900 per 
class, if the proposed budget 
for higher education is ap- 
proved by the state 
legislature. "We cannot get 
through the 1980s without 
part-time faculty." Butler 
said. "With the little money 
appropriated by the 
legislature, we have to use 



part-time teachers to serve 
the students" academic 
needs," 

Butler said he won't know 
until a few days before the 
start of classes whether or 
not there will be enough 
students enrolled in the 
classes to conduct them. An 
entry level class needs about 
15 students while the 500- 
level classes can be con- 
ducted with two or three 
because students need these 
classes for their degree. 

Butler said he sees a 
difficult 10 years ahead for 
IPFW, citing population 
trends for this area and 
economic deterioration. 
Consequently, his depart- 
ment has gone to the Fort 
Wayne high schools to teach 
Introduction to Philosophy 



for college credit to some of 
the fast track students, 
(those students better 
prepared for college.) 

"We really have two goals 
in mind when we do this. 
First of all, wc are stealing 
some of the potential 
philosophy students from 
Bloomington and 

Lafayette," he said with a 
broad grin. "Secondly, we 
hope to persuade some 
graduating rtudents to come 
to IPFW I feel they can get 
just as good an education 
here as at any other 
university." Ttiough most of 
the fast track students are 
already college bound, he 
said he hoped to attract 
some students who might not 
otherwise consider college. 



Rep. Hunt urges stricter child molesting laws 



By SYLVIA ORTIZ 

SUtf Writer 
NoUng bis bill to make 
'child molesting a Class A 
felony rather than a Class B 
felony had passed the 
Indiana House of 

Representatives with a vote 
of 96-0, Representative Jim 
Hunt, R-Fort Wayne, 
commented he did not an- 
ticipate any problems In the 
bill passing through the State 
Senate, 

According to the bill 
sponsored by Hunt, child 
molesters woiJd be faced 
with gb:lcter penalties. This 
bill would change child 
molesting from a Class B 
felony to a Class A felony. 

A Class B felony has a 
maximum sentence of 20 
yean and a minimum term 
at six years while a Class A 



felony carries a maximum 
term of 30 years and a 
minimum sentence of 14 
years. 

"The idea of raping, 
assaulting a child of 12 years 
or under Is the most heinous 
of all crimes," remarked 
Hunt, commenting the 
current penalty does not fit 
the crime and is not a strong 
enough deterrent. 

He further went on to 
deSGrit&gt;e the case of a nine- 
year-old Fort Wayne ^I 
who was assaulted while 
selling popcorn door to door 
for a school fund-raising 
projecL 

"It took the surgeons three 
and a half hours to repair the 
physical damage, but the 
emotional turmoil she will 
suffer tor the rest of her 
life," he said. 

The Fort Wayne 



representative noted reports 
of the child molesting crime 
have increased in the last 
five years, increasing to 129 
percent within the last 12 
months. 

Detective Wallers of the 
Indiana State Police com- 
mented also on the increased 
occurrence of the crime in 
recent years, 

"I'm not sure that it's 
really an increase or just the 
fact that now it is being 
reported more often," 
Walters said. 

'"People aren't as shy 
about talking about these 
types of crimes any longer. 
Because of the better news 
coverage and belter un- 
derstanding for the victim 
there is not the em- 
barrassment for the 
famihes. Instead, the em- 
barrassment is now placed 



on the perpetrator, as well 
itshouldbe,"hesaid. 

Walters is heading most of 
the investigations con- 
cerning cases of alleged 
child molesting within the 
FoB^j". Wayne area and 
surrounding communities. 

Both Wallers and Hunt 
agree that stiffer sentences 
would help to stem the tide of 
child molesting since under 
current "good time" laws 
many of the persons con- 
victed of this crime are 
released within three years. 

"Knowing that they would 
be getting stiffer sentences 
would certainly cause 
anyone who commits these 
crimes to think twice," 
Walters said. 

Hunt said Indiana 
presently has a child 
molesting law as opposed to 
only a statutory rape law like 



other states He also noted 
some questions were raised 
in the house voting session 
because of the bill. 

Some House memtters and 
attorneys were concerned 
about the harshness of the 
sentence in instances where 
only fondling of the child 
occurred, but Hunt brought 
out that although deviant 
sexual conduct is part of the 
state law, Indiana 
specifically defines deviant 
sexual conduct as 
penetration of the child by an 
object. 

Once this point was 
cleared up the bill was 
passed without any further 
objections. 

Hunt favors even stricter 
penalties, but he believes tiis 
bill is at least a step in the 
ri^t direction. 



Stereo course teaches physics, knowledge of equipment 



By DARYLS. BRANDT 

Copy Editor 

Buying a stereo system is 
easy— if you like It and It 
sounds good to you, get It, 
said Jurgen Lichti, a 
professor of physics at IP- 
FW. 

But Lichti felt the buyer 



should have some knowledge 
of how a hi-fi system works 
before making a decision to 
buy one— and he teaches a 
class which provides such 
Information. 

"nie course Is Physics of 
Stereo Systems. In it, the 



Cable hook-up 
has setback 



By NANCY SUCK 
SUff Writer 

Hie television department 
of IPFW has had repeated 
frusb-allons In Its attempts 
to obtain Its own cable 
television station. 

Beginning with con- 
tractual disagreements last 
summer between 

Cablevlslon and the Purdue 
ad minis Ira lion In West 
LafByette, the department 
has suffered numerous 
setbacks Including the 
latest; one of the conduits 
through which the cables are 
threaded is clogged with 
mud, and another Is 
nonexistent, even though It 
appears on the unlvetsily 
blueprint. 

Should the station evern be 
hooked up. It win be a higher 
education channel providing 
in-home credit courses, 
student productltHis and 
cultural programming 
provided by local unlver- 
slUes. 

Tim Singleton, com- 
muilcatlons Instructor here. 



Is enthusiastic about the new 
Channel 23, which will 
originate here. With IPFW 
as the chaimel's origination 
point, broadcasters here will 
not have to travel to another 
university to air their 
programs. Currently, IPFW 
broadcasts through 
television channels 39 and 55. 
Besides offering in- 
structional programming, 
Channel 23 will operate on a 
character generator that will 
broadcast a calendar of 
events and announcements 
while music plays in the 
background. 

The channel will be ac- 
cessible (or 24 hours each 
day, but il will only broad- 
cast for a fraction of that 
time until more program- 
ming material Is obtained. 

Although enthusiastic, 
Singleton la disgruntled with 
the deloys. '"It just seems 
like one thing after another," 
be said. Indeed It docs, but 
we are all watching and 
waiting. 



tjasic principles of high 
fidelity stereo equipment are 
explained. The class is 
geared toward students who 
have little prior knowledge 
of physics or stereo equip- 
ment. Like most physics 
classes here, the course can 
be used to fulfil a general 
science requirement. 

Taking the class might 
seem an easy way lo boost 
one's grade point 

average— Lichti smiled and 
shook his head at tlus 
suggestion. 

"I'm sure some students 
lake it for that,' he said, "but 
the class itself is not." He 
explained thai the course is 
designed for students who 
have a broad background 



and want further insight into 
the subject. Lichti tries to 
discourage those who are 
familiar with physics and 
stereo principles from taking 
the class, which is basically 
just an introductory physics 
course. 

"'We had been looking 
around for a new approach to 
teaching physics," said 
Llchli, a native of Germany 
who has taught here since 
1964, The course takes an 
application and teaches the 
physics that pertain to it 
instead of vice versa, he 
said. 

Many physical principles 
are simplified and presented 
in demonstrations, making 
them easy lo grasp. But 



technical terms and 
specifiealions iiave to be 
memoriied. "For this class, 
memorization is an easier 
way lo capture physics," 
Lichbsaid. 

The course has been of- 
fered here since the fall of 
1977, and has been gaining 
appeal Lichti said. 
Currently, 47 students are 
enrolled in the class. 

Lichti said he has learned 
a lot while teaching ihe class 
and tries to pass that 
knowledge on to the 
students. 

"Teaching the course 
stimulated my interest, and I 
learned about all the things I 
did wrong when I bought my 
first s&gt;'slem,"he said.

The Tuskers had lost three 
matches lo the Bearcats 
earlier in the year, all in 
straight sets. The triumph 
was the volleyball team's 
first victory ever against a 
Division I school. Ball said. 

"We were excited, lo say 
the least," Ball said -Really

The coach was especially 
excited about his team's

team of the caliber of

ticular the improved setting 
of junior Colin I-eiler, which 
"has really helped our of-

what the outcome In Ihe ring 
is going to be. It's just a 
matter of playing out one's 
role, and when it comes to 
rote playing professional 
wrestlers are second to none. 
Someday, one of these guys 
will win an Oscar for best 
male lead in a comedy. 

Many of those in at- 
tendance at the Memorial 
Coliseum on March 12 didn't 
look at the werstlers as 
actors. The contingent of 
"hard core" wrestling fans 
just wanted to see their 
heroes in the ring. 

How hard core can these 
people be? Here's just a 
sample of what I heard. . . 
and can print. 

"Knock his brains out and 
then break his neck," one 
unidentiTied man stood up 
and said. 

"Hit that sucker' he's 
notin' but yella," an elderly 
woman yelled. She then 
turned to me and said, "Isn't 
this great!" 

The majority of this sparse 
crowd was between 30 and SO 
years old. split fairly even 
between men and women, A 
big suriffise was to see three 
girls silling very dose lo the 
ring. 

They were high school 
students and were probably 
about the only members of 
their age group In the crowd. 
The three, Laurie Jones, 
Jody Saijer, and Julie Ross, 
came in from Warsaw area 
to see Championship 
Wrestling. Why? "Spike 
Huber is why we came into 
Fort Wayne, He gave us a 
kiss once." said Laurie 
Jones. Huber seems to be the 



lady kiUer on the wrestling 
tour. 

The three said they walch 
big-lime wrestling on 

television every week. 

Some of these wrestlers 
come and go over the years, 
but one man has been around 
for a long time. Many call 
him Mr. Championship 
Wrestling. His name is Dick 
Afflis, better known as Dick 
the Bruiser. He's been 
wrestling professionally for 
over 25 years, and shows no 
signs of slowing down. 

Some say thai wTestling 
has changed over the years, 
but the Bruiser disagrees. 
He said, "There's no dif- 
ference to me, Il's all the 
same as It was when I 
started." 

Being the most popular 
wrestler on the lour doesn't 
bother the Bruiser, but does 
he think that wrestling will 
suffer when he decides to 
retire from the sporl? ■■No. . 
. . there's always going to t&gt;e 
a crowd favorite. When I 
retire someone will come 
around and take my place," 
Bruiser said. 

The Bruiser, still in fan- 
tastic shape, has had a lot of 
memorable experiences 
over Ihe years. Bui one 
stands out in his mind. 

In the early 1970s the 
Bruiser and former- 
professional football player 
AlexKarrashadaruninata 
Detroit bar. The Bruiser 
recalled, "Karras thought he 
was tougher than me so we 
had a f i^t in this bar to find 
out. When we finished there 
wasn't a chair to sit in But I 
won the fight." The envelope 



Baseball team 
loses opener 

ByMIKEFRANKE 

Chief Reporter 

The IPFW men's baseball team started the season on a 
sour note by losing a Saturday doubleheader lo Belhal, 6-0 
and 11-4 

The losses came despite some of the besl opening day 
weather in recent years. 

Coach Larry Windmiller has a fifteen man roster this 
season, which is below the usual regular season roster of 18 lo 
20 players. 

Explaining the drop. Windmiller said, ''I made some rules 
this year Iht eliminate some of those players who had jobs 
and wouldn't be at practice every day. I wanted players that 
would commit themselves to baseball." 

Of Ihese players on the rosier, most are freshman. This b a 
problem that coach Windmiller has had to put up wilh since 
he's been coach at IPFW. 

■'It's tough putting a solid team on the field when every 
year we have to start over wilh freshmen, " he said. 

Windmiller hopes that this team will surpass last year's 
club, which won 12 games. 

"We've got a pitching staff thai is really inexperienced at 
this time, and our oulfieid is pretty weak," said Windmiller. 

The only pitching holdover from last season is Rick 
Stevens, who looked good early in the second game, bui was 
hil fairly hard as the game progressed. 

The squad plays a home doubleheader against Tri State 
today, and will travel to Manchester for a pair next Tuesday.
