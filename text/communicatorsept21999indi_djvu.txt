Starbucks coffee brews in library lounge 



by Came Anne Leathers, 
News Editor 



Students and faculty can now enjoy 
Starbucks Coffee on campus due lo the recent 
addition of a Starbucks Coffee stand In Helmke 

"Starbucks was excited to come on cam- 
pus," said John Schoenle, general manager of 
Aramark food services. "They were excited to 
get a presence In town and their prices here arc 
lower than what people would find at Starbucks 
out In the retail." 

Efforts began last spring lo bring Starbucks 
to campus and Aramark food services worked 
with IPFW to get permission to have the stand. 
The final decision was made during the summer 



and Aramark had to hurry to be ready for the 
fall semester. 

"The final decision was only made a month 
before school started. Starbucks got the cart for 
us In three weeks, even though It usually takes 
six, because they really want to try to accom- 
modate us," said Josh Clapper, Food Service 
Director for Aramark at IPFW. 

According to Clapper, the sales have gradu- 
ally been increasing and Aramark and 
Starbucks are already considering increasing 
the types of food sold at the coffee stand and 
Increasing or changing the hours to better 
accommodate students. 

"Right now we are working on adding to 
the menu blscotds, pastries, cold beverages and 
sandwiches," Clapper said. There is also a pos- 
sibility of us increasing our hours." 

Although the Starbucks Is currently located 
In the library, this could also change In the 



"With the current traffic now, we decided 
the library was where more students would end 
up sooner or later," Schocnle said. "Once the 
campus keeps growing, however, the plans are 
to keep It centralized In the campus." 



Starbucks coffee Is the first food addition 
to campus that offers a nationally recognized 
product and many students and faculty see this 
as a step forward for the campus. 

"It is really nice to have a place on campus 
that provides real food," said Linda Beach, com- 
munication major. "I also like the fact that 
when I'm here all day 1 can fill up a pot to carry 
around all day and not have to run downstairs 
to the coffee machine all day." 

The Starbucks Coffee stand is currently 
open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m, Monday through 
Thursday, and on Fridays from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. 



IPFW adds 
coaches 
to men's, 
women's 
programs 



by CameAnne Leathers, 
News Editor 



More than 15 new coaches and assis- 
unt riuihes have joined the athletic facul- 
ty for the 1909 fall semester. 

Coaches for women's volleyball, soc&gt; 
cer, softball, cross country*, track and bas- 
ketball are all new this year, as well as the 
coaches for men's basketball, cross coun- 
try, track and baseball. 

"Most of the coaches Trom last year 
took better paying jobs or got advance- 
ments to higher levels," said Mike Jewell, 
Sports Information Director. 

Jewell Is especially optimistic about 

new coaches and believes that they 
have the skills and goals that will help stu- 
dent athletes succeed. 

"These coaches have the mentality to 

and they want student athletes, not 

athletes," Jewell said. "They want to 
get students who are wanting to graduate 
and play sports— academics is basically a 
number one priority." 

If students do not maintain high 
enough grades, they arc not able to partic- 
ipate on the teams or graduate. To help 
students do well In classes, the athletic 
department Is offering aid. 

"There are study tables and some 
coaches even have their own Individual 
.nut; tables," Jewell said. 

Although Jewell Is optimistic about 
he ability of student athletes, he also 
knows that academics are most likely what 
be giving students their future 
employment. 

"Sports will not get you a job— not a 
lot of people come out of Division II sports 
into the NBA, so It Is important to get an 
education," Jewell said. 

Baseball coach Billy Gernon, who was 

assistant coach for the baseball team 

years ago, agrees with Jewell on the 
Importance of academics. 

"For the team, the number one objec- 
ivc is 100 percent graduation," Gernon 

Jewell Is confident In the new coaches' 
ibllides and, overall, is optimistic for the 
upcoming season. 

"Honcstiy, from what I've seen, these 
great bunch of coaches that are look- 

ut for the students' behalf. They want 

;nts to succeed In academics and that 
is great,* Jewell said.

Roller coaster deaths a good reason not to ride 



WHAT WE THINK: Lately there have been a lol of laialfties on rollercoasteis;

supposed to be thrilling, exciting 
and life threatening! Death Is a 
plague that has been hitting 
America's amusement parks with- 
in the last few weeks of August. 

Klmberly Bailey, 39. and 
daughter Jessica, 8, died on the 
Wild Wonder at Gillian's 
Wonderland Pier in Ocean City, 
New Jersey. 

In the sweltering heat, 28 
people had to remain in their 
seats for four hours because the

Injured. 

A 20-year-old man dici 
falling out of the Shockwave ; 
King's Dominion in Doswell, Va. 



Are these things safe? The 
death of the 20-year-old man was 
due to "rider misconduct." It Is 
believed that an anti-rollback 
device on the Wild Wonder failed 
to operate. The victims of the 
Shockwave and the Drop Zone 
came out of their harnesses. 

What are the regulations for 
rollorcoasters! It varies from state 
to state, city to city. It can vary" 
from park to park as well, depend- 
ing on what company owns It. 
Obviously something is being 
done. If you have ever ridden on a 
roller coaster there is some type of 
scatbeit or restraint to hold you 
from Tailing into oblivion. The 
examples mentioned above prove 
that seatbelts, harnesses and other 
restraints are not enough. 

Anyone who visits amuse- 
ment parks knows there is always 
a new ride. It Is bigger and faster. 
Did you know that the closest 
amusement park to Fort Wayne, 
Cedar Point, has fourteen roller 
coasters, more than anywhere else 
in the world! The Millennium 
Force, a new ride for the summer 
of 2000, is said to break ten world 
records. The first hill is 310 feet 
high with a 45-dcgrcc Incline. It 
goes over 92 miles per hour and 
the first drop is from 300 feet. In 
addition, a magnetic break will be 



used instead of a chain and a mag- 
netic break instead of a friction 
break. These improved devices 
reduce the amount one Is shaken 
while riding and stopping. There 
will also be tiered seating so 
everyone can have a front seat 

Wow, imagine falling from 
that sucker. We're not trying to 
Tip" on Cedar Point This ride is 
not even open to the public. We 
are just using it as an example. It 
is a larger, faster ride for the 
upcoming summer. Should we do 
away with roller coasters? That 
may be a little drastic. Should reg- 
ulations be Increased? Certainly, 
but that could be a long process. 
What can be done Immediately! 

We believe that not all roller- 
coasters arc unsafe, but for the 
meantime people should stay off 



We \ 



luld r 






report about any of our fellow stu- 
dents who died on a coaster. 

We hope that the rollercoast- 
ers across the United States are 
improved and that stiffer regula- 
tions are installed. But, for the 
meantime, the only thing we 
would really like you to do Is, 
once again, please slay off the 
rollercoastcrs. 



A college student's summer 



by Joan Poulsen, Staff Writer 

Surely we all remember those predictable 
and mundane grade school assignments in 
English class when we would have to write 
about what we did during our summer vaca- 
tions. For most of us It Included visiting grand- 
ma, playing outside, video games, family vacs- 
dons and trips to "The Lake." (By the way. If 
anyone can tell me where this famous place, 
•The Lake," Is located, feel free to do so. It 
would satisfy- years of curiosity.) 

Now that we are adults, most of us do not 
have those same carefree summers like those 
of childhood. So, what do we do now during 
our summers? To answer this question, which 
will probably be probed endlessly during the 
first week of classes, I asked various personal, 
friends and acquaintances. 

Many students hold full time jobs In the 
summer to earn extra money and then work 
part time during the school year. This income 
can be vital in ensuring that students can pur- 
chase such necessities as books, tuition, beer, 
rent, transportation, Lenny Kravitz tickets and 
school supplies. Other students opt for a sum- 
mer internship or co-op. One of my friends 
took an internship In Boston with a pharma- 
ceutical company, while two others got co-ops 
from local engineering companies. 



Many students travel abroad or domesti- 
cally. Some choose to study for a few weeks at 
Oxford University in England to make their 
trip overseas a little more educational. 1 heard 
many students talking about their trips to 
Cedar Point, King's island or Six Flags. Other 
common destinations Included Indianapolis 
and Chicago. People are still visiting the 
famous (or is It infamous?) "Lake," but with 
(heir friends instead of their parents. 

Then there is the category of students like 
myself. I'll admit It, I'm a nerd, but for politi- 
cal correctness I'll Just call these people "stu- 
dious." We took summer classes. Unlike last 
summer when t took five classes, I only look 
tbrecthls summer. Much better, but still no 
vacation. It really is a great way to take care of 
any classy; you've been .dreading, or getting 
caught up with or ahead on your credits 
toward graduation. 1 chose to take summer 
classes so that I could still graduate in four 
years despite changing my major three times. 
May I recommend that you take no more than 
two classes at a time unless you plan not to 
work and have NO life beyond that, or you 
have a lime share at Charter Hospital you've 
been dying to use. Summer classes cannot be 
blown off, no matter what you've heard and if 



you cry to, you will end up scrioosly stressing 
yourself out. 

Then there are some students who got 
married over the summer. Being engaged 
myself, I don't see how they were possibly able 
to plan a wedding and be a full time student. 1 
For the majority of you who aren't planning a 
wedding, you probably think that since thi 



wedding Is just o 


e day, it can't possibly con- 




imer. it can and does. So, to 


those of you who 


ved this summer, 1 congratu- 


late you! 




Then there a 


re the extremely fortunate

s, most at Deer Creek, visited relatives 
In Florida or other beautiful locations and 
were able to truly rejuvenate their minds for 
another year of serious studying, papers, pop 
quizzes, exams, presentations and hiking to 
those distant parking spots In seven inches of 
snow with a 50-mile-per-hour wind blowing in 
their faces, uphill both ways, barefoot and 
with 200 pounds of books on their backs and 
still like it. Seriously, though, 1 hope you all 
enjoyed your summers, whatever you did, and 
welcome back. 



Reflection and tasting the moment 



by Darci L. Denton, Staff Writer 




and tasting the moment. 1 look to my two little 
dogs. Life Is so simple and carefree for them. 
They live In the moment and rarely tum down 
an opportunity to play or nap or nibble a 
favorite Tood. I sometimes envy the uncanny 
connection that they seem to have with some 
of the more important things in life. They are 
great teachers and all I ever have to pay them 
for their lessons arc hugs and kisses and a 
warm place on my lap. These are payments 1 

vatchlng them now, one sleeping In 



the

Time stands still for no one. Even In those 
moments when times seems to stand still, It is 
moving along at a steady pace, unable to grant 
any wish of slowing down or speeding up. 

Our lives are like partially finished jigsaw 
puzzles. The final pieces arc set Into place only 
by our death and in between It Is in our best 
Interest to enjoy "creating" the puzzle that Is 
so uniquely our own: For some reason most of 
us look toward the "end" of everything to find 
the gratification that we can't seem to live 
without In doing so. we often are not in tune 
with the "now" of our lives. In our push to cre- 
ate the finished product, we tend to overlook 
the pure joy of the moments that seem to 
stand still, 

I'm sitting In the sun on my patio writing 
this, a gentle breeze visiting my exposed skin, 
calming me form the Inside out. In the 
Midwest, the unique combination of sun and 
wind this time of year knows no equal. If t 
were to become horizontal, I could nap until 
the sun says "goodnight" t truly love autumn, 
possibly because I know that It is the final 
stage of summer and as with anything else that 
is about to leave us, we tend to become nostal- 
gic and drink In all of the good that we possi- 
bly can before the final curtain rails. 

When I need a lesion in stowing down 



rawhide toy, lazily keeping sentry over all that 
he perceives to be his. They take turns like 
that, as though they somehow know that one 
pair of eyes and ears are enough to keep them 
safe and that "Mom" will intervene if some- 
thing bigger than both or them should come 
along. They are full of love and lessons and I 
absolutely adore them both. 

My puzzle Is being created with every 
breath I take and 1 don't want to miss a thing. I 
used to be In such a hurry living my life that I 
was unable to "be in the moment" and savor 
the quiet and special times. Slowing down has 
been good for me and I wouldn't go back to 
living In the fast lane for all the coffee (my 
favorite beverage) In Colombia. For me, appre- 
ciation for a slower pace comes with aging; so 
do creaky bones, but it's a trade-off that I can 
live with. 

Coming back to school has also played an 
Important part In my desire to slow down. 
There's so much here to digest and I'm sure 
-that I would miss important moments if I were 
to travel through this lime in my life at a 
speedy pace. Slowing down gives me time to 
reflect on my life, meet new people, learn 
thing 
a b o u 
myself an 



ust not one of those people. 

When the sun is too hot for us, we use 
of find some shade. When Ifs cold, 
we dress accordingly and, when it rains, we 
have umbrellas. We do what we can to control 
that which is more powerful than us. Like the 
weather, time Is a force that we can only con- 
trol by the way that we react to it. [f we expect 
time to stand still for us, we arc expecting an 
impossibility. Like sunscreen, 
clothing and umbrell; 
way that we live our lives helps 
serve as a buffer to those 
things that we cannot doml- 

Just as there arc time! 
when we will be sunburned oi 
freezing or drenched form the 
rain, there will also be times 
when we cannot slow our pace 
or relax and reflect as much as 
we would like to. Although I 
would like to walk my dogs 
today and take an afternoon 
nap with them, my busy 
ule demands that I finish this 
article, write a poem, study for 
math, and do some reading for 
my philosophy class. 1 won't 1c 
my academic responsibilitie 
suffer any losses Just so that 
can play and nap today, bu 
tomorrow after class I'll tak' 
some time to do those things 
Taking time to reflect keeps m&gt; 
grounded and focused 



Mtnaglng Editor 




Like the weather, time and our reaction to 
It is something to be experimented with: We 
can't really change any of it, only the way that 
we respond to It, 

Do yourself a favor today and, when all 
the business is behind you, take sometime to 
relax and reflect and "be In the moment," You 
might be surprised to find that merely perceiv- 
ing dme to be standing still is quite enough.

Creativity found everywhere 



by Nancy Simmonds, Staff Writer 



It's 1 a.m. In London. My friend 
and 1 have traveled across the North 
Atlantic from Fort Wayne for a two- 
week tour of Britain. Heathrow Is clean 
and quiet, the customs agents welcom- 
ing. The Underground Is also clean 
and feels completely safe. This is not 
the subway of New York or Chicago. If 
the ambience were not enough, one 
glance at the ads above our heads 
would bring us away from 'Kansas." 
The following ad In particular caught 
my attention: 

Trying to find a mortgage 
That fits you perfectly can 
be like 
Nailing Jelly to a wall. 

Right, let's nail some jelly. 

Isn't that a vivid picture? Unlike 
Fort Wayne, I found Britain to be full 
of Jelly masterpieces. I think that we at 
IPFW could take a lesson or two. I live 
north of Fort Wayne, where new con- 
struction abounds. I can name a doien 
new neighborhoods or shopping areas 
being developed around me. We saw 
one new house under construction in 
all of Britain. All else was renovation 
work. We have empty shopping cen- 
ters right and left up here-probably 
too out of style and Impermanently 
constructed to warrant the expense of 
remodeling. 

Hats olf to the powers that be who 
have elected to bring Kcttler out of the 
70s and Into the 90s. It Is depressing 
to work here without ceilings and with 
only utility lights, but 1 can see the 
progress and approve of the continued 
and better use of the space we have. 

Perhaps we could nail a little jelly 
to our own walls. The British construc- 
tion companies have allowed school 
children to paint the sidewalk barriers 
using historical motifs In relation to 
the hidden buildings. Wouldn't several 
artists' renditions of the mighty 
mastodon make a more charming 
entry that neon orange netdng? 

York Minster lost a portion of lis 
roof in 1984. Only six of the roof boss- 
es (circular ceiling ornaments) were 
salvaged. The Minster held a contest 
for replacements, designating six to be 
made From the ideas of children. 



There were 30.000 entries! Imagine 
thatl Standing on the floor of the 
south transept you can peer at the 
celling and see a little green space 
man, helping hands reaching to Africa, 
a depiction or the York Minster fire. 
and a man on the moon from a young 
artist in the United States. 

Public participation. Nailing Jelly 
to the wall. 

That is why I adi 
Landscape" on the exterior of Neff Hall 
and "The Wall" in the Fine Arts 
Building. These are cooperative 
projects, but more than artists, I'd like 
to see our public involved beyond 
donation plaque. What if our next 
building project Incorporated the 
hand or footprints or IPFW ID carriers 
In some wall or walkway? 

Nail some jelly. Personalize our 
buildings. 

This summer I passed a display 
case of art projects by non-art majors 
in Kcttler and on a tour of Neff, a dis- 
play or OLS department graduation 
pictures. Someone was proud enough 
or his or her students' work to share it 
with the rest or the world. 

Let's nail some Jelly. 

Are there visual projects from one 
department that could be shared with 



others? /

There Is a time and a place ior 
everyone to vent about a problem 
that bothers them. Frankly, I believe 
this Is as good a place as any. I per- 
sonally have a problem with those 
who lie. That is everybody Including 

People lie everyday about one 
thing or another. Yes, you can say 
I'm a hypocrite, but If you think 
about it we all are. That topic is for 
anuther time. 

1 don't know about any of you

but for t 






I of

problem or commitment still exists. 
The thought lingers In the back or 
my mind for weeks even months. 
These are what consider to be small 
lies such as 1 didn't bring you your 
book because I forgot It. (Shh...l 
actually don't know where it Is.) 

I believe ir you have too many 
of these lies they will eventually 
bring you down. There are also very 
large lies, like stealing, cheating or 
framing someone. Yikes, if you do 



ble. Maybe y

some form or another. 

Recently, I was lied to. I could 
do little about the ejects or the He. 
The lie took away a great deal or my 
time, therefore 1 am behind In ir- 
responsibilities for this week. When 
you don't "get things done" there is 
a ripple effect that goes out to 
everyone who interacts with you. 
Next time you choose to lie to some- 
one, please think twice. 



JFK Jr. wasn't prepared 



by Nancy Simmonds, Staff Writer 



On the evening of Friday, July 
16, 1999, a single-engine Piper 
Saratoga piloted by John F. Kennedy 
Jr., crashed off the coast of Martha's 
Vineyard. On board with him was 
his wife, Carolyn, and her sister 
Lauren Bessette. 

The hazy night limited visibili- 
ty to about fo\ir miles. Kennedy, 
who received his pilot's license in 
1998, had logged about 200 hours 
of flight lime; however, he was not 
certified for Instrument flying. More 
experienced pilots refused to fly 
that night and turned their sched- 
uled flights over to scrubs. A pilot 
flying Into Martha's Vineyard IS 
minutes ahead of Kennedy's flight 
had to rely solely on his flight 
Instruments because of the visibility 



descending from 6000 feet 

Then, in just 12 seconds, the plane 
plunged from 2200 to 1300 feet, 
per second, about ten times the nor- 
mal rate. The plane disappeared 
Tram radar and crashed into the 
sea. Autopsy results stated the three 
people died on impact. 

John Kennedy Jr. , son of assas- 
sinated President John F. Kennedy 
and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, 
was publisher of George, a flounder- 
ing magazine which mixes politics 
with celebrities. 

Carolyn, his wife, was a publl- 



Her slst 



i Bess 



vice-president of Morgan, Stanley 
Dean Witter, was an investment 
banker. Newscasters made the most 
of the story with continuous live 
coverage or the search, the recovery 
or debris, family history, the discov- 
ery of the bodies and the eventual 
burial at sea. 

Many people were saddened to 
hear of yet another tragedy In 
America's premier political family. 
However more were disgusted by 
the poor Judgment which resulted 
In such waste of life. Time taken to 
think ahead and evaluate conse- 
quences could have made all the 
difference In their world. Kennedy, 
like too many of us, exhibited an 
attitude of studying only so hard 
and then winging It. Evidence: tak- 
ing three times to pass the bar 
exam. In this flight situation there 
was no second or third chance. 

I think John F. Kennedy Jr. 
made an unfortunate decision, a 
■winging it the rest of the way" 
decision that plagues many of us in 
the 90s. 

Convenience and availability of 
Immediate gratification have 
changed our priorities. We want it 
our way. We want it now and we'll 
throw It away when we are finished 
with It. We have become a short- 
ighted people. We are hungry 



more overweight than any other 
society in the world. 

It is easier to sit on the couch 
after work and watch television 
than gel out for the minimum dally 
half-hour's hard exercise recom- 
mended by medical authorities. We 
will copy someone else's paper or 
pirate off the Internet rather than 
research the Information ourselves. 
Then we wonder why we rise to 
mediocrity In our jobs. 

We'll drop a class because the 
instructor actually expects us to 
think, to assimilate what we have 
learned. That Is more work lhan we 
arc prepared to do. We expect the 
inflated grades we have always been 
given so we try only so hard. 

This shortsightedness has 
blinded us to accepting our respon- 
sibilities ror who we really are. 
Society/ family/ teach en are at fault 
for what we cannot do ourselves. 
The outside demands on our time 
are blamed Tor our lack or study or 
exercise. The weather Is cause for 
our plane crashes. Who's in charge 
of our life anyway? 

Let us open our eyes and 
accept the responsibility for who we 
really are. We are what we eat. We 
are out of shape because we do not 
exercise. We are mediocre because 
we do nor strive to be any dlfroront. 
Our plane crashed because we chose 
to fly and we weren't trained to fly 
in that kind of weather. i '»■

Music and Movie Reviews 



'Niagara Niagara' worth seeing, hearing 



by Brian Lindquts! 
Guest Writer 



"Niagara Niagara" Is a film lhal 
takes a firm stance In the realm of 
modern love stories. Far from the 
Cinderella story thai most modern 
films feature, "Niagara Niagara" is 
based on the lives of two castaways 
searching for some comfort in their 
misplaced Identities. 

Marcy, played by Robin Tunney, 
Is an abandoned family member who 
suffers from Tourettes syndrome. 
Seth, played by Henry Thomas, is a 
shoplifting loner immediately drawn 
to Marcy. Seth and Marcy Immedi- 
ately form a bond so believable that 
It draws you into the story. 

The two decide to take a trip to 
nearby Toronto In order to find a 
particular doll for Marcy. However, 
Marcy forgets to bring her medica- 
tion and substitutes liquor to help 
dull the effects of her disease. Seth 
becomes Increasingly Important to 
Marcy as their Journey progresses 



and she Is unable to get a refill on 
her medication because she does not 
have a prescription. 

As Marcy's condition deterio- 
rates, Seth continues to offer his 
unconditional support which is turn- 
ing Into unconditional love. The two 
become desperate and attempt to 
steal her medication after the phar- 
macy has closed for the evening. 
Their plunder is foiled and the irate 
owner of the pharmacy shoots Seth 
In the teg. As Marcy attempts to 
drive to safety, she crashes the car 
on a remote stretch of road. Walter, 
a low-truck driver played by Michael 
Parks, rescues Marcy and Seth. He 
offers them a place to stay, which Is 
the first trace or compassion they 
receive from anyone. 

Marcy's condition con- 



tlni 



i to w 



and i 



beats Walter to death during one of 
her episodes. Seth and Marcy contin- 
ue their journey to Toronto and find 
the doll In a department store. 
Unfortunately, the particular doll 
they arc looking for is the store's last 
doll and Is chained on display. This 



sends Marcy into a tirade that marks 

the film's unfortunate but memo- 
Accompanying the film Is an 

excellent soundtrack released on V2 

Records. Featured artists Include 

Patty Griffin, The Cowboy Junkies, 

Lucinda Williams and Lori Carson, to 

name a few. 

The opening track performed by 

Patty Griffin, "Regarding Mary," Is a 

startling metaphor for Marcy's place 

in the story. "She 

comes swlngln' In 

with her tire iron, 

she hits everything 

in sight when she I 

gets flyin'.- The 

lyrics highlight 

much of Marcy's 

tormented behavior 



with Marcy's disease: "Everything 1 
touch, runs wild." 

"Something More Besides You," 
performed by The Cowboy Junkies, 
is a rhetorical question showing how 
the bond between Seth and Marcy 
has become unbreakable. Lucinda 
Williams' "Sharp Cutting Wings 
(Song To A Poetl" further signifies 
the love between Seth and Marcy: 
"You're the one, you're my shining 
star. You're the one I've been wallin' 
for." 



This entirely acoustic album is a 
true musical companion to the film 
"Niagara Niagara.* All of the songs 
give meaning and emotion to the 
film and tell their own story of love, 
loss and the hardships In between. 

I cannot think or another sound- 
track that complements its respective

IPFW upsets #6 New Hampshire in Best Western 



The Communicator Page 7 




by Brian Miller, 
Sports Editor 



An old aphorism goes, "to 
be the best you have to beat 
the best." Thai is what was on 
the minds of the Dons as they 
traveled to New Hampshire to 
participate In the Franklin 
Pierce College Best Western- 
Ball box Classic. 

A week earlier, the Dons 
traveled to East Lansing, Mich. 
to play an up and coming 
Michigan State team.

opening of what It was going 
to take to be a top team. 

In an exhibition, the Dons 
did come up with more shots 
than the Spartans; however, It 
was Michigan State that capi- 
talized on the Dons' mistakes. 

Fast forward to this past 

The Dons come Into the 
Best Wes(ern-Ballbo\ Classic 
unranked, opening against a 
highly touted New Hampshire 
team which was ranked Ob in 
the Division II poll. 

So exhibition games mean 
nothing? The Dons were out- 
shot 18-2, but much like [he 
Spartans, connected on their 

occasions. 

Sophomore Chris Kramer 
got the team on the board by 
scoring at the 3:49 mark of

from 20 yards up to give the 
Dons a quick lead. 

Goalkeeper Jeff Blchey 
allowed his only goal of the 
game at the 20:19 mark of the 
first half when a defensive let 
down allowed New 

Hampshire's Nell Williams to 
find a wide open Richard 
Walker to even the score at 
one goal a piece. 

Early In the second hair 
IPFW forward Mark Watson 
capitalized on a New 
Hampshire mistake when he 



intercepted a pass from the 
defenseman to go around 
Svantesson for the open net 
goal. 

In addition to Rlchcy's 
nine saves out of ten shots, 
IPFWs defense held the oppo- 
nents back and managed to 
connect on both scoring 
opportunities. The Dons 
pulled off the upset and head- 
ed Into the championship 
game against host Franklin 
Pierce. 

The championship game 
saw many good opportunities 
to get on the board for the 
Dons, but It was a very tough, 
hard-nosed defense that kept 
the Dons off the scoreboard. 
The Ravens captured their 
second straight shutout of the 
tournament and prevailed 2-0 
over the Dons. 

The Ravens outshot the 
Dons 11-8. 

IPFW's best scoring 
chance came in the 80th 
minute when midfielder 
Braden Butler was stopped on 
a breakaway. 

Although the Dons did 
not win the championship, 
they did knock off one of the 
top teams in the country and 
gained a lot of confidence 
along the way.
