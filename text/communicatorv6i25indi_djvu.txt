The NBA playoffs are still several weeks away, but the

Chicago, Kansas City, and Golden State seem to be in for sure, while 
Houston, Cleaveland, New York, Detroit, Milwaukee, Seattle, and 
Portland are fighting for the remaining spots of the ten team playoff 
system. The team with the best record in each of the West and East 
divisions will earn a buy. Washington and Chicago have the upper 
hand in their respective divisions. 

The defending champion Boston Celtics are still thought by many

It's built to take your mind 
off the economy. 



The Peugeot 504 diesel is a 
logical answer to the high cost of 
driving a car these days. 

You never have to worry about 
gas, because it doesn't use any. It 
takes diesel fuel instead. Which is 
usually a few cents cheaper than 

Besides saving you the worry 
of gas, the Peugeot saves you the 
headache of tune-ups. That's be- 
cause there's nothing to tune up. 
You never have to replace points, 
plugs, or condensers because a die- 
sel doesn't use them. 

However, you do have to 
change the engine oil and filter ev- 
ery 1500 miles. 

The Peugeot also saves you 
money in the long run. Our heavy 
duty shocks are built to last a long 



time. And the Michelin steel-belted 
radials far outlast ordinary bias ply 

But there's more to a Peugeot 
diesel than extraordinary economy. 
There's extraordinary comfort. Its 
four-wheel independent suspension 
gives you an unruffled ride— even on 
bumpy roads. Its fully reclining 
front seats cradle your body. And 
its sliding sunroof lets you have 
the weather whenever you want. 

The Peugeot diesel even gives 
you the security of four-wheel pow- 
er disc brakes. And child-proof rear 
door locks. All standard. 

So come in and drive the 
Peugeot 504 diesel. It might not 
take your mind completely off the 
economy. But it sure can make the 
economy easier lo take.
