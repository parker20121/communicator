More budget cuts likely for lU 



BLOOMINGTON. Ind. (lU 
News) — Indiana University's 
budget will be cut an addihonal 
S3-4 miUion in light of the deficit 
management plan announced 
Thursday by Governor Frank 
O'Barmon. 

lU has now absorbed more 
than SlOO milhon in cuts and 
withheld appropriations as Ihe 
state's worsening economy 
prompted a series of budget 
reductions beginning last 



"The scope of the budget c 



affecting Indiana University is 
very serious and harmful," said 
lU ■ President Myles Brand. 
"These additional reductions 
posL' a great chnllenge to our 

lain access and encellence. They 
place even greater upward pres- 
sure on tuition levels and 
impede our ability lo contribute 
lo the slate's economic growth 
and development efforts. ' 

Brand acknowledged Ihe dif- 
ficult set of decisioru facing the 
governor and recognized that 



Brand said. 

The cuts announced today 
include S22 million in lU's gen- 
eral operating budget and an 
additional SI.2 million reduc- 
tion in special state appropria- 
tions for several projects, includ- 
ing university technology 
initiatives. 

To date, the university has 
dratvn deeply from its oivn 



reserves and has benefited from 
efficiency efforts, including 
administrative cuts, in order lo 
lessen the impact of state budg- 

Building maintenance budg- 
ets have been particularly hard 
hit by these cuts. It now appears 
that additional iob reductions in 
Ihe university s facilities area 
are inevitable. 

"Our R&amp;R (repair and reha- 
bilitalion) budget has been deci- 

See Cuts, p. 8 



The study trip to Monterrey, 
Shipchandler said, is an impor- 
tant aspect of the new course. 

The trip was designed to 
"provide the students with a 
cultural immersion experience 
that will help them develop a 
global outlook," he said. 

"Engaging the students in 
real lite processes will hopefully 
lead lo regional economic bene- 
fits," he said, 

"In America we lend to only 
think locally." Shipchandler 
said. He added that the stu- 
dents, who will likely become 
business leaders in the Fort 
Wayne area, will be able to apply 
what Ihey learned from the 
o-vpiTiente to their future careers 
in the business world. 

The seminars the students 
attended at Monterrey Tech 
focused on the history and cul- 
ture of Mexico as well as the 
country's business practices and 
economy 

The students also spent lime 
visiting Monterrey manufactur- 
ing facilities and meeting with 
Mexican business people and 
staff members of the United 
States Consulate. 

Beforehand, the students had 
been developing export market'

Most 
assuredly. I do 
nol agree with 
the lifestyle of 
those who have 
convinced 
tlumselves Ihey 
are ^y. lesbian 
or bisexual, but 
doesinyd;^- 
agieementof 
IhOT lifestyle 
choice gave me the righl lo conunit hate crimes agairwt them? 

The answer is a tesounding, "No. " 

t would imagine that Ijie persons responsible lor the dcbc^ 
ingoftheposleis would cotisider themselves to be better than 
someone who is gay. but when I consider Ihat gay people aren't 
going arouTid committing hale crimes like siralglil people do, 

One cannot believe m morals and dignity when it comes lo 
the choices that we matte, only to tiun around and become a 
hypocrite by publicly corrunitting a Itale crime against those who 
havemadecnoices we do not agree with. 

Sure, moral decay runs rampant in America today, and 
probably not very many people coiJd InleUigcntly argue other- 
wise, but it is when the moral decay has seeped into llip very 
people who would otherwise consider themselves moral that 
true moral decay has occuncd. 

To those wlio have commilled this hale crime, 1 say two 
things. First, you are a cosvard and a loser. By defadng the poster 
and committing Ihis hale crime, you are dropping to the same 
level of those you think you have hurl. Have you really been so 
affected by moral decoy Ihat you have Ijeen driven lo coomul 
such a hate crime? You should be ashamed of youtself, and I 
would suggest Ihat you drop out of school ana fake up flipping 
burgers otuie local rast food Joint, because a person such as 
yourself ivill never amount to anything. 

Second, you are the epitome of an idiot, and I frankly don't 
knoiv how you got into college. Wjijle joii'n; flipping burgers, 
perhaps you should go back lo t'lemenLir\' ~d)ool and team how 
to spell, t&gt;ecause you don't ipeti queer "qeer, ' 

To those of you who agree witti mc todays but hive not 
agreed with my morality columns in the pasl. I cli-illcnge yow to 
nol be so closed-minded, lo look al Ihe whole pkhjre, nol simply 
Judging the opiruon by ils topic, but by judging the opiruon by 
the fads used to support Ihe opinion. 

Look at the opinion and ."ce what il is based on. Is then.' a 
logical argumenl pul forth lo support Ihe opinion expressed, or 
Is the opinion just the wild ramblmg ol an idealist mmd? 

Again, let me reiterate tfiat although I do not agree with or 
condone Ihs lifestyle that gays, lesbians and biscxiiols have cho- 1 
sen, Ihey OJB still human beinjp and llicy dejcrve equal rights. 

As for those of you who commit hale crimES. it's sUII out foi 
debate if you deserve equal rights. 

1 think die United Si-xualities paster says it best, "We might 
be lesbian, gay, bisexual or Slraight, either way, we demand 
respecL.-You h\av/ who you are~And you need lo stop Ihc 
hate."

Letter to the Editor: 



Every week I pick up an issue of Ttie Communicator and typically flip directly to Mr. Diehl's 
From Itie Ri^t" column. I find his column quite amusing usually, being an independer ■ ■ ■ ■ — 
an free thinker. Wl»y do i fii\d 11 so amusing you may ask? 

Because week in and week out I find Mr. Diehl rnaking at least one remark that makes me won- 

Mr. Ralph Nader in this last prosidentia] election liecaiise he never would tiave received the 
Republican nomination! 

From Diehl's comments about the President t&gt;eing the moraJ role model for our nation to look up 
I, and his emphasis time and again on Ihe moral depravity of our nation, [often wonder if lam read- 
ig a political column or a charismatic evangelical sermon. 

However, the article in the March 6 issue takes the cake. Not only does Mr. Diehl continue his

lorally depraved" action of President Ciinton. 1 also 
increase after Mr. Gilbert's play so terribly scarred our image for life. 

Finally, with the many non-Christian students on Ihe IPFIV campus, a campus thai prides itself 
on dlvetsi^ in a slate that is erne of the most diverse m the country — a country I might continue to 
add that is one of the most religiously and culturally divert in the world with over 200 different reU-

If you tiave CT.'en been to a gas station, 
I painted a model airplane or done heavy house- 
I work_^'ou've smelted 'uihalants." 

The name "inhalants'" covers a group of 
ei 2.000 common household products. 
Those products include cleaners or stop- 
pers, paint Uiinjiers, gasoline, glues, markers, 
paints, aerosol sprays, medical gases and other 
iorted chemicals. 
All of these seemingly harmless chemicals 
tlul many of us use in Ihe course of our day-to- 
day existence can be deadly if they are misused. 
When used improperly, household chemi' 
cats are poisons! Their fumes contain poisonous 
"Dxins. Knowing this, it seems unlikely thai 
nyone would ivanl to deliberately and conlin- 
ally want to "huff" these chemicals. Bui peo- 
lie do it every day. 

Those who huff gel a sense ol lime and 
space being altered, tliey become lightheaded 
and have difficulty seeing and hearing. 

These feelings in Ihe brain are known as a 
"buzz." This buzz n why people keep huffing 
and huffing and blowing their minds away. 

People think a biXEl is a harmless way of 
feelljig good; however, while the buM, which 
la.sls for a variable amount of lime, seems fun at 
the lime. Ihe toxins go right from the brain and 
inio every olher organ in the body via the blood. 



.\nd e^cnivhciv Ihey eo. Ihey leave a Irail. 

The short- lerm effects of huffing are many. 
tvut Ihe most unpleasant include dizziness: nose 
bleeds: blisters or a rash around Ihe moulK" 
bladder and bowel conlrol lailure; slurred 
speech; mood swings and of course, where 
would brain damage be without seizures 
vutsions and blackouts? 

If Ihis diatribe ofshort-lerm effects brought 
on by misusing household products isn't 
enough lo dissuade you, there are some long 
term effects to be concerned about also. 

The chemicals damage brain cells which 
causes complieahons with mtelligence. memory

Cartoon characters to come to life, cavort 
'BOOMwhackers' percussion show 



WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.fPU 
News) — Wile E. Coyote and the 
Road Rurmcr will make cameo 
appearances in "BOOM whackers." 
a Sunday, April 14, concert by the 
Purdue Drum Line and 
Percussion Ensembles that wiil 
lealure innovative music and 
some surprises. 

Scheduled for 3 p.m. in 
Stewart Center's Locb Playhouse, 
the free SO-minule show is appro- 
priate for all ages. 

Drawing inspiration from 
the Warner" Bros.' "Merrie 
Melodies" cartoon "Zoom and 
Bored," Purdue senior Jack 
Morcland has created an original 
percussion piece that will be per- 
formed while the cartoon, fealur- 
mg Wile E. Coyote and the Road 
Runner, is projected on a large 
screen beliind the musiciar\s, 

Moreland boasts a wide 
range of percussion experiences 
in his four years at Purdue, from

Composing music not only 

Erovided the perfect challenge, 
ut also allowed Moreland to 
combine his passion for percus- 
sion wiih his mierest in anima- 
tion, which he studies for his 
degree. A sale video of "Merrie 
Melodies" cartooru provided an 
action-fdled 6:14 bit of 7,aniness 
called "Zoom and Bored." 

Arranging, a bell set — 
saved from junior high music 
classes — on his apartment coffee 
table, Moreland watched the 
video night after night with the 
sound doivn. 

"I played the little bells with 
my fingernails and listened lo 
melodies to see what worked." 
he says. "I watched It so much, I 
got to the point where i was 
dreaming the cartoon. I would 
wake up in the middle of the 
night with a melody in my head." 
Guided by Purdue percus- 
"--nela Nave, 



Moreland aimed at a serious 
composition, not one dominated 
by honks, crashes and other 
goofy sound effects so typical of 



An ensemble of six percus- 
ists play more than a dozen 
rumenls in 'Zoom and 
Bored." Musical tempos of up lo 
240 beats per minute — "Hail 
Purdue" is 152 beats a minute — 
match the heightened mood of 
the cartoon and provide a serious 
challenge.

"There are defimlely parts 
of it that are happy, but there are 
definitely parts that arc not. 
Some parts arc almost sad," he 
says. "The music looks at Wile E. 



Coyote and the fact that he never

he keeps getting up arid trying

that. I'm glad it went this way.

The contemporary numbers 
are balanced with classical pieces 
like Rosaurao's "Marimba

Nave, are programmed, along 
with numbers that take a playful 
approach to serious works.

obviously has not (oreotten the 
love ^he once had, and may stdl 

"Laura taking out the 
garbage," she says as she hangs 
the painting of Laura on the 
wall. This process is repeated 
several times, each with Laura 
per/orming a different task, 
Finally.Laurashowsupand the 
games begin. 

The two jaded lovers curse 
al each other, fight with each 
other and grapple with each 
other And perhaps the best 
weapons of the two pamters 
come into play as they smear 
paint on each other And we 
aren't lalkmg about a thm line 
here and there. 

Wo see just how embit- 
tered and jaded the prideful 
and poverty stricken Laura can 
be. She says the death of her 
former husband, Juan, would 
be too merciful if she |ust cut 
out his heart. 

Malmslrom plays the lone- 
ly and hurt Laura with the ener- 
gy and bcliev ability the com- 
plex character deserves 

However, failure to do so 
would be unforgivable for 
someone with su^ a presti- 
gious background. There were 
times when she was loo loud, 
though. A black box theatre is 
by nature designed to be much 
more intimate and invitmg lo 



an audience. Consequently, 
they are much smaller, in this 
case seatmg under 100 p&gt;eop1e.

love for Laura. But she also 
shows a vengeful hatred 
toward the woman who left her 
life eight years ago without a 
word since. 

Those are very difficult 
emotions lo experience, let 
alone portray well. \ would not 
be able to attest to her believ- 
ability had I not seen this mix of 
human emotions before m other 
real people. 

While Parsons and 
Malmstrom create ciuile a dis- 
turbing atmosphere on their 
own, they did receive a httte 
help from the set. 

The frames of Ihe two 
doors were purposely crooked 
and misaligned, as well as Ihe 
walls being uneven and jagged. 
This helped to force the audi- 
ence to become in tune with the 
unsettling nature of Ihe pnxluc- 
lion right from Ihe beginnmg. 

"The Color of Augusl," 
pushes the bounds and depicts 
with originality the carnal 
' nature of human passion and 
sexuality. A definite must sec.

at it for well over a month now. 

The Mastodons, 10-14, head in to April on a high 
note after a doubleheader sweep of two seven inning 
games against Valparaiso this past Saturelay 

The Dons came alive with an offensive explosion in 
game one. With a four run third inning, highlighted by 
freshman third baseman Jesse Shovek. they went up 7-2 
and would later go on lo win 11-7. Nine out of the 10 
IPFW bailers had a hit in Ihe game, as well as eight of 
Ihe 10 batters who also scored a run. 

Seniorcalcher. Rich Hale went 3-3 in thegame with 
two RBI's, two runs scored and one walk. 

Sophomore pitcher Jason Hoivath (2-4) was solid 
in his win, while freshman pitcher Adam Ferris struck 
out five in thrceinnings while only allowing one hit and 
earning his /ir^l save of the season.
