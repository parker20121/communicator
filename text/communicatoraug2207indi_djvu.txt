Student loans: investment or scam? 



By JESSIE RUCKMAN 

ruckjl01@ipfw.edu 

College stu- 
dents face ma- 
nipulation daily, 
whether it is by 
the media , family 
or friendly in- 
fluence. But are 
they being taken 
for a ride when 
paying their stu- 
dent loans? 

In an ef- 
fort to clean up 

student loan cor- 
ruption, the House 
passed the Student 
Loan Sunshine Act, 
a bill that would 
require lenders to 
disclose any fi- 
nancial relation- 
ships they have 



with educational 
institutions. 

It may seem 
like a minor detail 
in a world full of 
restrictions, but 
the consequences 
of Sunshine could 
be far-reaching. 

Lenders 
would be required 
to divulge not 
only any donations 
to an educational 
institution. but 
also are prohib- 
ited from giving 
any type of gift 
or use school lo- 
gos in their mar- 
keting campaigns. 
There has been a 
long-standing re- 
lationship between 
educational insti- 
tutions and private 



guarantors , and 
according George 
Miller, "until 
recently , one of 
the nation's larg- 
est student lend- 
ers had hired of- 
ficials from five 
different colleges 
to perform various 
services, even as 
the officials con- 
tinued on their 
colleges ' pay- 
rolls . " 

The corruption in 
the student loan 
racket is nothing 
new. and some gifts 
have been extrava- 
gant, including 
large banks, such 
as JPHorgan Chase. 
According to a 
White House press 
release, "the 



lender , JPMorgan 
Chase. . .paid over 
$70,000 for a har- 
bor cruise in New 
York City for over 
200 college finan- 
cial aid officers 
in 2005." 

Sunshine was 
passed in the 
House in order to 
combat and reverse 
the corruption 
involved in stu- 
dent loans. Sena- 
tor Edward Kennedy 
(D-MA) said that 
lender practices 
need to be exam- 
ined closely and 
any actions that 
prevent students

The fall se-

"Going to col-

FCC and censorship 

How much is too much? 



By DOUG SCHMIDT 
Schmdn01@ipfw.edu 



Since . January 
of 2001. all televi- 
sion sets with screens 
larger than 13, inches 
have come equipped 
with V-chips., which 
allow parents to con- - 
trol the content their 
children can see. On 
August 2. the Senate 
Connittee on Commerce. 
Science, and Transpor- 
tation approved a bill 
which may bring this 
technology to comput- 

Should Senator Hark 
Pryor's (AK-D) the 
Child Safe Viewing Act 
of 2007 pass both hous- 
es of Congress . the 
Federal Comnunications 
Comnission will "con- 
sider measures to en- 
courage or require the 
use of advanced block- 
ing technologies that 
are compatible with. . . 

Internet platforms 

television sets, DVD 
players . VCRs . .cgtde - 
set top boxes, satel- 
lite receivers , and 
wireless devices." 

The Center for Democ- 
racy and Technology, a 

tional liberties advo- 



cacy group . expressed 
concern that the bill 
may be the first step 
in giving the FCC reg- 
ulatory authority over 
internet content . Adam 
Thierer of the re- 
search and education 
organization The Prog- 
ress and Freedom' Foun- 
dation echoed their 
concerns, stating that 
the bill "opens the 
door to an expansion 
of the FCC's authority 

multiple platforms and 
threatens to undermine 
private, voluntary 
rating systems in the 
process." 

While the V-chips 
found in televisions 
utilize content rat- 
ings voluntarily sub- 
mitted by the tele- 
vision industry, the 
bill . calls for new 
;COi\tent filters that 
"operate independent- 
ly of ratings pre-as-" 
signed by the creator 
of such video or audio 
programing. " 
( . Whilq.the bill does 
not state who would 

der the new system, 
given its experience 
with regulating tele- 
vision and radio, the 
FCC would be the most 



obvious choice. 
The hill does not call 
for adult or obscene 
content to be banned, 
but material rated for 
"adults only" could 
face limited sales. 
Currently. an "AO" 
rating from the En- 
tertainment Software 
Rating Board means 
that a piece of soft- 
ware will not be car- 
ried by Wal-Mart. Best 
Buy, or Target. 

Wal-Mart will not 
carry any CD with a 
"Parental Advisory" 
sticker from the Re- 
cording Industry As- 
sociation of America. 
Similarly, a "NC-17" 
rating severely lim- 
its a film's earning 
potential . 

Some might question 
the need for govern- 
ment involvement in 
content rating, as 
there are already many 
produdts and servic- 
es that help parents 
shield, their children 
from objectionable 

material. 

Satellite TV provid- 
ers DirecTV and Dish 
Network offer their 
own parental controls. 
Parents can also buy 
the Weemote , a re- 
mote control that can 



only access the chan- 
nels that parents want 
their children to see. 
CoimtonSenseMedia . 
org, Kid-In-Mind.com. 
and many other websites 
offer free reviews of 
films, letting parents 
know if a movie is ap- 
propriate for their 
children . Clearplay . 
com sells special DVD 
players that can re- 
move sex, violence, and 
cursing from films. 

Apple's iTunes soft- 
ware and Microsoft ' s 
Zune Marketplace of- 
fer parental controls 
which can be used to 
prevent children from 
purchasing music with 
objectionable lyrics . 
McAfee Internet Secu- 
rity Suite. Norton In- 
ternet Security, and 
other software can be 
used to lower the risk 
of children being ex- 
posed to objectionable 
content online.

Student loans overrun by sleazeballery 



By BRANDON HARNISH 



If an institution 
with a historical- 
ly unrivaled record 
of waste , scandals 
and corruption were 
called upon and 
trusted to root out 
waste, scandals and 
corruption , would 
you not find the 
initiative at least 
somewhat puzzling? 
I would a'nd that is 
precisely why I am 
scratching my head 
over the recent cries 
for more government 
intrusion into the 
student loan indus- 
try. 

I can think of no 
other entity quite 
as crooked, deceit- 
ful and scandalous 
as our own federal 
government . 

Recently, the House 
passed the Student 
Loan Sunshine Act 



with overwhelming 
approval (The Stu- 
dent Loan Sunshine 
Act? Are they seri- 
ous?) . I guess we 
are supposed to be- 
lieve that its summer 
rays will beam down 
upon those malicious 
lenders and make 
college affordable 



the 



:ame will only 
the situation 



said. Murph. 
sleazeballery 



He 1 1 

The 

that r has found its 

way into the student 

loan industry is the 

result of govern- 






a 1 1 . 



even ".quite possibly 
with the most bloated, 
such a wasteful!, and 

expensive institution 
in world history." 



The types 
of kick- 
backs and 



pay 



if f s 



cheerful name, this 
law fails to ad- 
dress the crisis 
and will inevitably 
make a bigger mess 
of things. As econ- 
omist Robert Murphy 
points out. "At root 
the problem is mas- 
sive government sub- 
sidies and regula- 



that lend- 

cial aid 
offices 

in entirely private 
and voluntary in- 
stitutions such as 
grocery stores . A 
Kroger manager has 
every opportunity 
to take brides from 
his wholesalers to 
stock the shelves 
with more expensive 
items. However, such 



self-serving would 
injure the bottom - 
line as customers are 
free to shop else- 
where thus providing 
ample incentive to 
stomp it out. These 
built-in self -regu- 
latory mechanisms 
are chiefly defi- 
cient in the govern- 
ment university sys- 
tem because cutting 
costs and weeding 
out corruption does 
not render higher 
profits. 

The solution to the 
crisis in higher ed- 
ucation is to show 
the federal govern- 
ment the door. If 
lowering the cost 
of education is the 
goal the last p,lace 
we should look for 



is 



the 



federal government 
- quite possibly the 
most bloated, waste- 
ful and expensive 
institution in world 
history.

Socialized physicians can pencil you in for December 



By DOUG SCHMIDT 
Schmdn01@ipfw.edu 



The release of 
Michael Moore's latest 
film. Sicko. has revi- 
talized the nationwide 
debate on healthcare 
reform and "single - 
payer" healthcare sys- 
tems. While the Ameri- 
can healthcare system 
is not without its 

certain that a single- 
payer system would be 
an improvement. 

Moore ' s fo- 

cus in his film is 
on the relative costs 
of healthcare in the 
United States and in 
France. England, and 

While many 

Americans struggle to 
afford medical care , 
according to Moore, 
for those lucky enough 
to live in a country 



with socialized medi- 
cine , healthcare is 

However . all 
government programs 
are ultimately paid 
for by taxpayers. Moore 
spends a great deal of 
his film discussing 
the "free" government 
services available in 
France, such as medi- 
cal care, paid time off 
from work, and even 
childcare. Howavet. 
these social programs 
are not without cost. 

According to 
the Organization for 
Economic Co-opera- 

tion and Development , 
single French adults 
with no children pay 
21% more in taxes than 
their American coun- 
terparts. Married cou- 
ples with children pay 
nearly 30% more. 

Would social - 
ized medicine . in the 
United States be more 
expensive than the 
current system? Quite 



possibly, if Wiscon- 
sin's new healthcare 
plan is any indica- 
tion . "Healthy Wis - 
consin" will insure 
every Wisconsin resi- 
dent under the age of 
65. 

According to 
an analysis by The 
Wall Street Journal , 
the program will cost 



any introductory eco- 
nomics textbook will 
show, there are two 
ways to lower the price 



of 






$ 1 5 



crease the supply, or 
decrease the demand. 

In the United States , 
the government has a 
long history of arti- 
ficially limiting the 
supply of medical care.

and sales taxes. tury, 

-^ — • — i — i in re- 
sponse 
to lobbying pressures, 
the government gave 
the American Medical 
Association the power 
to control the number 
of hospitals, medical 
schools . and doctors 
on the market. 

Between 1906 
and 1944, the AMA 
closed down medical 
schools it considered 



Wi s - 

consin 's total revenue 
in corporate, income, 
and sales taxes. 

The program 
represents an aver- 
age of $510 a month in 
higher taxes for every 
Wisconsin worker. 

What could be 
done to lower the cost 
of healthcare under a 
socialized system? As 



to be sub par, cutting 
the number of schools 
from 162 to just 69. 

volvement also in- 
creases the price and 
limits the supply of 
prescription tned ica - 
tion. According to a 
2006 study in Health 
Affairs, the cost of 
getting a new drug ap- 
proved by the FDA av- 
erages between $500 
million and two bil- 
lion. 

This cost is 
passed along to con- 
sumers. 

What about the 
demand for healthcare? 
Socialized medicine is 
designed to separate 
the cost of healthcare 
from the consumer. 

The cost to 
taxpayers is the same, 
regardless of how much 
healthcare they con- 
sume. Without any in- 
centive to economize , 
consumers naturally 
demand more health - 



In Canada, 
to high demand 
healthcare, 
can face long lines 
and delays . Accord - 
ing to Timely Medi- 
cal Alternatives, Inc. 
an organization which 
helps expedite Canadi- 
ans' access to health- 
care . there are 875 , 000 
Canadians currently 
waiting for referrals 
to specialists or med- 
ical procedures. 



How do&lt; 



TMA 



help these needy in- 
dividuals? Very often, 
by taking them to pur- 
chase private health* 
care in the United 
States . 

Despite Michael 
Moore ' s frequent use 
of the word "free." 
socialized medicine is 
anything but. Single- 
payer healthcare in 
the U.S. could result 
in higher taxes and 
long delays for care.

"I believe that I can have loans 
to help me out with school financially.

time management to keep myself focused 
By only taking out loans for what is 
truly necessary. I am able to manage my

Lauren Hoyt - Senior 

"In this day and age its almost 
impossible to not have a student loan, 
but quite frankly with the way student 
loans are set up they give you six 
months to a year after you graduate to 
make your first payment. It gives me 
time to get settled in, get a job. and 
then start making payments." 



Sedina Husidic - Freshmen 

"I am against loans because the 
way loans are handled. They don't do 
background checks on the people who 
use them. Those who don't have money 
need loans and those who do just take 
advantage."

Music Building fosters creativity 

Structure to house IPFW students and Fort Wayne Philharmonic 






I Kelly McClendon 
nclek01@ipfw.edu 



The new music build- 
ing on campus is some- 
thing spectacular to 
see. Although con- 
struction is still go- 
ing on, leaving some 
portions yet to be 
completed, the build- 
ing is expected to be 
ready for its grand 
opening celebration on 
October 4. The build- 
ing is formally ti- 
tled The John and Ruth 
Rhinehart Music Center 
and is an absolutely 
am azing structure. 

The music center is 
just one of the many 
improvement projects 
currently happening 
on campus. The archi- 
tecture of the center 
makes the building 
the most avant-garde 
on campus. 

The first floor fea- 
tures the 1,600 seat 
Auer Performance Hall, 
which is where the Crn- 
nibus Lecture Series . 
as well as the Phil- 
harmonic , will per - 

"I am so very excited 
that it is their name 
that is on the music 
building in perpetu- 
ity. When we need nxin- 
ey to name something-- 



money to name some- 
thing, but it is crit- 
ical that we receive 
money with a name that 
has special signif i - 
cance to the cause for 
which we have a need , " 
said Linda Ruf f olo , 
Executive Director of 
Development . 

The stage in the 
Rhinehart Recital 

hall features an or- 
nate wooden floor, 
and the building walls 
are decked out in tan 
and burgundy. Sever- 
al practice rooms are 
also located on the 
first floor , giving 
students the opportu- 
nity to practice in a 

The whole building is 
highly inspirational 
to producing creative 
thoughts . 

The view from a 
second story confer- 
ence room is splendid. 
Through the rimmed . 
expansive windows, 

you can see the hid- 
den campus nature . 
Evergreens and trees 



abound, with birds and 
other small wildlife 
rustling through the 
grass and foliage. 

Besides being full of 
natural light and ex- 
pansive, the building 
also has many special 
features. Sound buf- 
fers are installed in 
most hallways, unique- 
ly allowing two con- 
certs ot lectures to 
go on at the same time 
and not be overheard. 
The Auer Performance 
Hall also has a wrap- 
around balcony that 
will allow patrons to 
sit behind the stage 
and watch the perform- 
ers. The stage in the 
Auer Hall is not set 
up for theatrical pro- 
ductions . 

In response to the 
new building, the mu- 
sic department has set 
up an exciting sea- 

"We have a full 
slate of recitals and 
concerts for the 2007 
- 2008 year, with the 
two biggest being the 
Gala Opening Concert 
for Auer Performance 
Hall on October 4." 
Chair of Music Dr. 
Robert Bean said. 

Although plays will 
not be performed at 
the music center, the 
theatre department 

also has big plans for 
the 2007-2008 season. 
Patrons can expect 
four plays, including. 
The Lark, Waiting for 
Godot, A Doll's House 
and Wonderful Town. 
For those who have 
already toured the 
building, the response 
has been excellent . 

"Overall , having a 
superb facility which 
is state of the art 
and completely 21st 
century, enhances ev- 
erything we do and al- 
lows us to not only do 
it better, but with 
greater ease." Dr. 
Bean said.

Think your romantic 
life has issues? Try me. 



By JESSIE RUCKMAN 
ruckjl01Sipfw.edu 



Like every woman. 
I strive to have a 
little romance mixed 
in among the books, 
papers , and overall 
trauma of collegiate 
life. I am picky with 
romance, too, and tend 
to choose the wrong 
men. 

Who doesn't at some 
point or another? 

But what hasn't hap- 
pened to me (that I 
know of, that is) is a 
secret crush. Nobody 
has ever admitted that 
they have had a thing 
for me but was too shy 
to say anything. Un- 
til way too late, of 

So imagine my shock 
when Coffee Boy random- 
ly asked me out on an 
impromptu date. There 
I was taking shelter 
in the regular gather- 
ing place, minding my 
own business and -BAM! 
I'm caught totally off 
guard , and next thing I 
know. I'm plopped onto 
a barstool talking to 
Coffee Boy. his apple- 
green eyes sparkling 
in the H-im flicker of 
candle light . I nev- 
er noticed those eyes 
before but they are 
electric tonight. 

Our conversation 
sparks and catches 



fire : there ' s nothing 
we don't talk about, 
and we laugh a lot. We 
talk about everything 
from the hilarious to 
the nitty-gritty de- 
tails of everyday life 
. . . you know, the 
things one never talks 
about on a first date. 
Ever. 

And while the two of 
us sat perched on our 
stools and dangling 
beers in our hands. I 
realize this is that 
moment. This is that 



moment. 



and as if the 
puppet master pulled 
both our strings simul- 
taneously, we kissed. 

You're expecting me 
to say. "And it was 
electric!" 

Nope. It was much 
more than that. Usu- 
ally (and many can 
identify) a first kiss 
is more like a medi- 
cal evaluation than an 
enjoyable experience 
that goes something 
like this: 

udge Hi: A little 
spitty . Could have 
used a bit less drool. 
Oh my CODI Get your 
tongue out of my 
throat . I finally 
found the next member 
of Kiss but I - can't 
- BREATHE1 

It wasn't like that, 
either. It was peace 
ful and fluid and 
rious. It was calm

ly warranted a swoon- 
worthy sigh. I think 
I did gaze into those 
apple -green eyes and 
sigh. It couldn't be 
helped, really. 

So what went 
wrong? 

Well! That's a load- 
ed question . isn ' t 
it? Fast forward to 
one week later where 
Coffee Boy and I met 
up again, apparently 
expecting lightning 
to strike twice. Sit- 
ting among a group of 
8-10 people. I felt 
isolated and spot- 
lighted. Things were 
just weird, and no 
amount of draft beer 
would fix that. So 
after many attempted 
and failed starts at 
conversation . Coffee 
Boy walked me to my 

STOP! 
And ask yourself, 
'what would Jessie 
do? ' Personally, 
standing under the 
soft glow of moon- 
light with an attrac- 
tive and interesting 
person, I would have 
either hugged them or 
placed a kiss on his 
cheek. But not Cof- 
fee Boy! 

He stared down at 
his shoes, and then 
as though resolute 
in his decision, he 
reached out and shook 
my hand. And the 
message couldn't have 
been clearer. 
Unm. OUCH. It was as 
though he had reached 
into his pocked and 
dragged out a bucked 
of ice, dumped it on 
my head and proceed- 






the 



back and say, "See ya 
around buddy" . 

Luckily the strange- 
ness of the night 
rubbed goodwill on 
me, because instead 
of going straight home 
to reevaluate my sex 
appeal with a bottle 
of Blanc. I decided 
instead to laugh. 
And laugh. And laugh 
some more. 

Really, who shakes 
a girl's hand?

Like so many in-

and uniformed, so she 
joined groups to help 
her feel more at home. 



Being an RA has helped 
Leupp to become more 
extroverted, and she 
feels that she could 
bring her experience

RA's are specially

Hey you! Learn 
something new! 

Don't stink or turn your 

laundry pink 




By NTXCI DALY 
dalyne016Hpfw.edu 



Ah, the smell of 
clean laundry! For 
many of you fresh- 
man, this will be your 
first time doing your 
own. My first tip: do 
it regularly! You'll 
appreciate having a 
variety of clothes to 
choose from each morn- 
ing without using the 
sniff test. Your peers 
will appreciate it 

There have been 
plenty of students who 
didn't do laundry of- 
ten and didn'i 
bother with the sniff 
test I 

Second- it really is 
important to separate 
colors and whites . 
Why? Watch any sit - 
com wtier e someone does 
laundry for the first 
time, and you'll see. 

If there are any red 
colored items that get 



thrown in with your 
whites, they will bleed 
and rum your whites 
pink. Now. this isn't 
as big of a deal as it 
was in the past, since 
pink is now kosher for 
both men and women to 
wear, but make sure 
it's on purpose. 

Third- and get 
ready, because this 
is a complicated deal 
here- turn on the wa- 
ter, let it run for 
about JO seconds, pour 
your detergent into 
the flowing water, and 
wait until the water 
level of 
bubbles before throw- 
ing your (separated) 
clothes into it. Good 
luck freshmen. Remem- 
ber that hygiene never 
goes out of style, and 
that even though you 
may not live with your 
mother, she'll prob- 
ably be available to 
help with any launder- 
ing needs.

A new season of soc- 
cer has been ushered 
in with a new divi- 
sion, new coaches and 
plenty of new faces. 

IPFW joined the Sum- 
mit League, formerly 
known as the Mid-Con, 
putting the men's soc- 
cer team in contention 
for an NCAA title. 

"I think we have a 
pretty good shot at 
getting to the NCAA 
tournament because we 
have a small . but pow- 
erful league," said 
Chas Parry, senior. 

With a strong lead- 
er ship of three se- 
niors, the dozen or so

look forward to learn-

And according to new 
assistant coach Ben 
Trevino. the odds of 
the team making it to

good.

Bell named new athletic director 

brings enthusiasm, extitementto athletic Aind raising

"Me have control of 
our own destiny at 
IPFW." said new ath- 
letic director Tomny 
Bell as we sat in his 
quaint Gates Sports 
Center office. 

He gestures excited- 
ly with his hands and a 
bright . eager smile as 
we discuss the future 
of sports at IPEV. 

Judging by the zeal 
with which Bell speaks . 
anyone jogging by his 
office at the Gates 
running track; .wouldn't 
think get the- impresr - 
sion that we were dis- 
cussing the- "Dons as 
much as a professional 
team such as the Phil- 
adelphia Phillies. 

And don't think that 
team name came out of 
nowhere: Bell worked 
with the Phillies for 
eleven years as their 
athletic trainer before 



"I worked for 
Phillies every 



resigned last spring. 
Bell intends to bring 
IPFW into the Division 
I spotlight by focus- 




ation." said Bell." 

His track record 
demonstrates the dedi- 
cation that will bring 
IPFW the fund rais- 
ing attention that it 
needs to bring it up 
to par with the Simmit 
League teams. 

Taking over for ex- 
director Mark Pope . who 






ally developed its po- 
tential for boosting 
the university's fund 
raising revenue." said 
Bell, and a major part 
of his job is to do 
just that. 

And although the 
fall sanester will be 
a time for departmen- 
tal evaluation, Bell 



plans to have a stra- 
tegic plan for IPFW 
athletic department's 
financial future in 
place by January. 

Chancellor Michael 
Wartell said in a re- 
cent press confer - 

" [Bell] brings to us 
a wealth of knowledge 
and experience in NCAA 
Division I collegiate 
athletic administra- 
tion and fund rais- 
ing. Tommy's high en- 

' etgy level, his people 
skills, and his natu- 
ral . warmth will make 

- him an instant success 
in'-both the Mastodon 
and Fort Wayne contcu- 

Bell received his 
bachelor's degree from 
Virginia Tech and a 
Master of Science in 
Education from Radford 
University. He has two 
children: Joey (22) 
and Courtney (20) .
