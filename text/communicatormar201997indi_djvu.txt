by Jeremy txcnbargtr 
Editor 

While many srudcnls baked 
themselves aJong the beaches of 
Florida or California during spring 
break, many others were left in Fort 
Wayne to deal with ice, ifie "Stars on 
Ice" loui Ihai is So while Ibe weath- 
er in town may have been a little 
crappy, ai least there was something 
to shine a light nn things 

This year's 
"Stars on Ice," 
which came to the 
Memorial 
Coliseum last 
We d n e s d a y , 
included a numtxn' 
of the world's best 
profc s Sio n a I 
skaters. Original 
greats like Sciin 



H a 



lilt 



Rosalynn Sumncrs 

and Torvill and 

Dean lead the 

show. While more 

recent favoriics 

like KrisLi 

Yamagucbi. Kuri 

Browning and 

Paul Wylic added 

some lerrific 

momenta of their 

own. Nevertheless, 

let us noi forget the 

others like 

E k a i e r i n a 

Gordeeva, Elena 

Bechke and l^cms l^etruv, Radka 

Kovarikova and Rene Novotny and 



Jill Trenary who all added some very 
entertaining perfomiiinccs 

Nevcrthelcsi, this year's main 
aiiractions were Yamaguchi 
Browning and Hamilion. Each of 
their performances seemed to spark 
the audience and hold their attention 
With every blade that touched the 
icc. the audience seemed to get mote 
and more caught up in their lalenui. 

Yamugucbj was the woman of 
elegance and beauty Her perfor- 
man ce s to 
"Love is Ail 
Around'* and 
"A Natural 
Woman" were 
skated with 
passion and in- 
depth concen- 
ffation I gue-sj, 
her Olympic 
gold medal and 
two world 
championship 
titles have 
made their 
impact 

Four-time 
world Cham pi - 
on and 

Canadian 
champion 
Browning 
mixed 
Hamilton 's 
humor with his 
own personal 
flair to become 
one of the audi- 
ence's favorites. Whether it was his 
humorous moments in "The Red 




routine or his leaping 
jumps and powerful turns ui 
"Serenade to Sonia," tlie audi- 
ence couldn't get enough 

On the other hand, the 
biggest impact was brought by 
the long-time favorite 
Hamilton. His outrageous rou- 
ime to "Largo a] Factotum" 
had people rolling in their 
seats. In the end, the audience 
rose to their feet to honor him 
Throughout the night, the 
Olympic gold medalist, four- 
time world champion and 
lour-ume United States cham- 
pion, brought the audience to 
(heir feel and had them beg- 
ging for more. 

Other great performances 
were ones that most ice skat- 
ing fans have come to recog- 
niie. such as Wylie's 
"Mission: Impossible" and 
Trenary's "These Boots are 
Made for Walkin." Each of 
which were more exciting to 
watch in person. However, 
both fell in the imdsi of their 



lavonle ice skater 
be Scott Hamitlon 



The pair skaters were ter- 
rific. Torvill and Dean lead 
them with grace and style. 
1'beir unique style set the tone 
for the night Bechke and 
Petrov were the most impres- 
sive. Bechke was lifted, thrown and 
swirled: audience members were 
almasi afraid to see wliat would hap- 
pen next. 

Finally, let us not forget 
Gordeeva, once a pair skater with het 




The professional skaters participating in "Discover Stars c 
1996-97 Tour

Too litfle or too much 



by Rebecca D. Manlcy 
SUfTWriur 



In 1993, Jim HanzeU's father 
was neadng the end of a long battle 




father in the 
nursing 
home, tak- 
ing periodic 
walks to 
work out the 
cramps in bis legs His walks often 
ended ai the nursing station, where 
Hartzell enjoyed talking to the nurs- 
es. Before the year ended, Hanzell 
had lost his father to the devastating 
disease But he had developed a fas- 
cination with nursing that would 
lead him into a new career. 

Hanzell had already worked for 
26 year^ as a Systems Analyst at 
General Electric when he enroUed in 
the nursing program at IPFW At 
fust, he was a Utde nervous. 

"You're always a liidc 
insecure — you think, ciin 
you make the grades?" 
said Hanzell. 

The blood and gore nurses 
routinely face, were initially a con- 
cern for Hanzell, who said be had 
difficulty dealing with the times 
when hLs cai would vomit But his 
determination helped him to over- 
come that concern 

"I dtvided it wasn't going to be 
a problem." said Hanzetl. 

And, so far ii h.is nol been. 
Hartzell recalled a recent operation 
he wimessed which involved the 
total replacement of a knee Every 
portion of the existing worn knee 
was removed, the bone was dnlled 
and a new prosthetic knee was 
inscned, 

Hanzetl opted for early rchre- 
menl from GE in July 1996 and now 
attends classes 



a hospital ofieraiiiig room. 

The science courses are interest- 
ing for Hanzell, but they are also 
tough because of the huge volume of 
information ihat must be learned. 

"It yi'U liRik di pe&lt;iple studying 
from a disiaiiu:. )uu pick the nurs 
ing majors out by the size ot iheu 
books, ' Hanzell said displaying 
one of the tKiolu he is study- 
ing this semester, "A_2 000 
page monster that should 
have come equipped with 
wheels." 

Hanzell anucipates great 
technological changes in the 
health cai( Held within the 
exi 20 years. Cost ana ethical 
debates also abound, as health care 
concerns and euthanasia keep mak- 
ing headlines, Hartzell understands 
why patients would choose to limit 
treatments in hopeless situations, 
but finds that some physicians are 
reluctant to uphold patients' livmg 
wills, 

'Their medical orientation is to 
ueai to cure — the well-being of the 
patient is not considered," said 



Throughout 
his second 
round of 
college. 
Hartzell has 
appreciated the sup- 
port offered by his 
e, Nancy, 
"She's put up with 
a lot." said Hartzell. 

Nancy, who runs a 
day care service, said she 
was not surprised by her 
husband's decision to be a nurse. 
She was concerned about the hazard 
of AIDS, but determined that 



HanzeU's cautious nature would 
prevent any exposure. 

"Jim IS a very particular per 
son," said Nancy, "He won't expose 
himself to anylhing through care- 
lessness " 

Hartzell does not have any 
a'Uremeni plans at umes, hui doirs 
plan to eventually cut his lioui^ But 
m the meantime, said ht: looks ten- 
ward to his new career and the 
opportunity to wime&amp;s more "fantas- 
tic operations." 

"The technology is out of Lhis 
world." Hartzell said.

care and his life is an accumulation

cuted wiib patience and precision 

Luther WhiUiey is among the 
top a[ his profession. Like an old 
pro, he has the advantages that 
come only with years of experi- 
ence. He, like no other, pays close 
attention lo the smallest of details. 
He also realizes that he must avoid 
public acknowledgment for his 
work at all cosLs His anonymity Ls 
essential lo his success. Vanity 
would lead to imprisonment 
because Whimey is a master thief.

In the mood for ItaUan food, 
fasi^ Head to Fazolis on Siellhom 
Road, a quick 10 minute drive 
from campus 

Very clean and cheerful, Fazoli's 
looks more like a cozy Italian cafe 
than a fast food restaurant Red 
padded chairs at faux marble tables 
and displays of crockery, pastas 

' vegetables lend to the Italian 
feel, as does the easy listening 
'Italian-style" music that plays in 
the background. 

Fazoli's offers counter and drive 
through service and will take 
phone oiders for the drive through 
Fazoli's also has a complete cater- 
ing service 

The manager, Todd James, filled 
me in on the service philosophy 
under which Fazoli's operates 
There are no customers at Fazoli's, 
only "guests" Fazoli's aims to 
"wow" guests by offering service 
that is a cut above the rest. 

Fazoli's counter service goal is 
to deliver a guest's meal in 35 sec- 
onds or less and the servers will try 
to personally deliver any meal that 
does not come out of the kitchen 
thai quickly, regardless of how 
busy ibey are I dined in twice at 
Fazoli's and the service was 
incredibly fast both times. 
Additionally, Fazoli's "wowed" me 
by personally clearing my tray and 
offering me additional brcadslicks 
during my dinner. 

While nothing is prepared from 
"scratch" on the premises, all of 
Fazoli's sauces are prepared espe- 
cially for the restaurant chain 
according to their own secret 
recipes. Fazoli's offers pastas such 
as spaghetti and fettucine alfredo 
and Italian specialties such as 
lasagna. chicken parmesan and 
ravioli Also, on the menu are 
pizza. Italian soups and a meatball 
sandwich- A variety of salads. 
made fresh daily, are available in 
the cold case. Mother's brand 
cheesecakes arc offered for dessert 



The chain is well known for their 
signature garhc brcadsucks, which 
it offers in unlimited quantities 
with dine-in entrees The Siellhom 
Fazoli's serves approximately 
16,000 breadsticks to 6.000 cus- 
tomers each week I 

Daily lunch specials arc avail- 
able Monday through Friday for 
S2.89 each (without drink), and it 
Ls possible to swap one day's spe- 
cial for another Fazoli's will also 
occasionally offer "all-you-can- 
eat" specials or "off- the- menu" 
items, such as shrimp and scallop 
feitucine. for a limited time. 

The drinks are Coke products 
and are self-serve with free refills. 
The drink/utensil bar has loLs of 
thoughtful additions, such as real 
lemons for tea and styrofoam con- 
tainers for leftovers. 

It is possible to cat a low fat 
meal at Fazoli's too. The mine- 
strone soup has only 13 grams of 
fat and a dry breadsiick (no garlic 
butter) has only 8 grams of fau 
The spaghetti with tomato sauce 
has 6.8 grams of fat and the meat 
sauce adds only amHher 1.2 grams 
of fat The garden salad has a mere 
3 grams of fat and there 
reduced calone Italian dressing 
available And for desseri. the 
lemon Italian ice has no fall 
Fazoli's prints a nutrition guide 
that hsts the fat, sodium, choles- 
terol, carbohydrate and calorie 
content of all the foods on 
menu. 

Fazoli's offers flexible employ- 
ment hours for college students as 
well as some unique benefits 
Fazoli's college tuition assistance 
program is available after six 
months to any employee working a 
minimum of ten hours a week with 
a mmimum 2 GPA. After two 
years of employment, the assis- 
tance amount is doubled 

Fazoli's has two locations, 6525 
Stellhorn Road and 439 W 
Coliseum Blvd. They are open 
10:30 am. to 10 pm Sunday 
through Thursday and 10:30 a.m

DARE parents 
to do their job 



With all the tiype laiely 
aboul DARE (Dnig 
Abuse Resistance 
Educaiion) and its effectiveness 
— or lack Uiereof — the real les- 
son has been lost, Tlie lesson is 
that regardless of (he efforts pul 
forth by Ihe U.S. Educaiion 
Department in coopeialion with 
police to teach young school 
children aboul the dangers of 
drugs, the responsibility lies 
with the parents of children. 

II should come as no sur- 
prise ihai Ihe $400.000- a- year 
DARE program in Fort Wayne 
is lacking any slatislics to 
prove its effectiveness. 

We should Rrst pinpoint 
what DARE'S goal is. If it is 
simply to educate children about 
dnigs, then it is wasted money. 
Parents and teachers can. and 
should, educate school children 
aboul drugs and their dangers. 

However, if the goal of 
DARE is to prevent children 
from doing drugs, then not only 
have they wasted money, but 
Ihey have tailed miserably. 

Nonetheless, most would 
agree thai the intentions of 
DARE were good ones, even if 
they were misguided 

To assume that 17 mere 
hours of discussion with 
school children (generally 
from K-5) regarding drugs is 
enough to have any real last- 
ing effect is to underestimate 
the hard work and determina- 
tion it lakes to rear children in 
the right direction today 

If DARE'S goal is to edu- 
cate children aboul the dangers 



of drugs in hopes of preventing 
drug use then they should 
reevaluate their method. 
KJndergartners through fifth 
graders are too young for any 
seminars to have any lasting 
effect on the actions of children. 

DARE should aim its pro- 
gram toward a more mature 
school audience which is more 
likely to benefit from the pro- 
gram than the younger chil(h^en 

Instead of asking for 
more money to enable the 
program to reach the older 
school crowd, DARE should 
start in middle schools -- not 
elementary schools. 

Furthermore. DARE should 
be more aggressive in its quest 
to educate and prevent drug use. 
Instead of having police officers 
come in and laJk to school chil- 
dren, they should have recov- 
ered drug addicts come in and 
honesdy discuss their baitJe with 
drugs and how quickly it can 
ruin a life 

DARE'S intentions are 
good ones but they need to be 
revamped and the effect of 
their efforts can only be 
viewed in conjunction with the 
daily educaiion of children by 
their parents, 

It is Ihe parents who have 
failed to do Iheir job to teach and 
prevent children from doing 
drugs. Although even ihe best 
efforts of family and community 
alike do not always prevent chil- 
dren from doing drugs, the effort 
of both needs to be persistent in 
order to teach our children not lo 
give up on life.

which would undoubtedly help 
prevent needless and irresponsi- 
ble deaths due to firearms each

from being effective. 

BOO-HISS to the producers

replaced 12-year-old Joanna 
Pacini after she became ill. The

caused these different perceptions? 

Recendy, I was discussing diis 
exact same subject wiih a friend of 
mine. My opinion revolved around 
the fad thai I thought sex should 
mean something. It should be shared 
beiween iwo people who have 
learned lo love and irusi each other 
and want lo further those ideas. 

However, for my friend, ii was 
simply an aci of pleasure He 
thought there were no problems wiih 
two complete strangers meeting 
each other and running direeily to 
the nearest hotel or bedroom With 
these ideas in mind, he ihoughi that 
desires could never be completely

would always be something you 
would be scared lo uy." he said. 

The whole conversation just 
really seemed to ligjhl a fire some- 
where in my soul. At the end of the 
conversadon. I realized how lighdy 
many people, including myself, per- 
ceive sex Even though, in reality, 
it is something that is so power- 
ful It is something ibai can 
unexpectedly change a person's 



to reality. 

Now, I am a 
strong believer 
that sex is saaed. 
Nevertheless, in 
the past, I have 
slipped and made 
wrong decisions, 
contradicting 
myself While I 
diought my smalt- 
tovm background, 
my close family

strong morals 
would prolecl me, 
I was wrong 
Instead, ihe 
things that I 
thought were 
making me a 
stronger person 
only came back 
to throw me to 
the ground.

to drift towards the baclc burner I In the 90s, when people partake 



Not just a cartoonist; 



in sex, dicy are no longer at nsk 
solely of becoming pregnant. Even 
though everyone has become 
aware of the AIDS virus, there arc 
just so many other sexually trans- 
mitted diseases (STD) out there 
just ready to be caught. It's a hit 
and miss situation 

With diese ideas in mind. I guess 
condoms should be mentioned. If a 
person is going to have sex, con- 
doms should be used. However, they 
are not always effective, and people 
seem to put all their faith on Uie use 
of an easily ripped, laiex condom. 
Nevertheless, how may people have 
you heard that have become preg- 
nant or have gotten a STD while 
using protection? I wonder, am I the 
only one thai feels that sex seems lo 
be taking over peoples' lives? 

Now, I don'i want to seem that 
I'm preaching, bui do people ever 
think about what diey're having sex 
for? Do they understand Ihe risks? Is 
that all relationships stand for Uiese 
days? It's all depressing, but 
these questions seem to touch 
me routinely. 

Now, I'm not asexual or even 
real rehgious; that's not what I'm alt 
aboul. I just believe that things in 
life are there for a reason And for 
me, it's just hard to discover what 
sex is really all aboul. Sure, ii helps 
build a family. Yel, is that all? I don't 
believe that sex is here simply lo 
provide pleasure. It should just 
mean something. 

This column was nol meant to 
send a message lo tell you what to 
do or not to do. However it is a type 
of warning dial says. "Be careful, 
think aboul what you're doing " And 
then ask. "Is ii all wonb ii' " 



Vandalism just for 'kicks' 

The decline of human morals reaches far 




On Wed- 
nesday, March 
5, my little 

while car was 
vandalized in 
the parking lot 
at Lone Star 
Sieakhouse and 
Saloon while 
my girlfriend 
and I were 
inside eating dinner The two nght- 
side tires werv slashed and die finish 
on the same side was "keyed" from 
bumper lo bumper 

The macho punk-boys who did 
this have certainly proved their mas- 
cuhniiy and uncqualcd testosterone 
levels to me In fact, it's entirely 
possible that ihe«; "hot dogs" \m- 
naied on my car to mark dieir leni- 
lory. knowing ii would t)e obscured 
by the snowfall and damp ground 
conditions that night. 

In my mind 1 envision two gold 
chain-weanng, luno-Unied, T-Bird- 
driving, W.W.F — watching saps 
with "NO FEAR" laiioocd on their 
privates, standing by my car con- 
versing in diis manner of dLilogue: 
1st Guy: "Huh hub. That'll 
show him. Huh huh." 

2[k1 Guy: "Uh, yeah. Show him. 



Show him good Huh huh " 

But perhaps I'm being overgen- 
crous when I presume that Ihey are 
able 10 comprehend subject/verb 
agreement I surmsc dieir kind real- 
ly doesn't need lo, as they'll eventu- 
ally wind up in an iron-baned 
boarding room 

In any case, I firmly believe in 
the axiom. "What goes around. 
comes around." They'll get theirs 
someday, somehow. Who knows, 
with their vindictive inclinations 
maybe the same thing will happen to 
one of iheir cars someday I don't 
like to wish evil upon anyone, but 
future retribution by like-minded 
simpletons might be the only way 
that they'll ever leam a lesson. But 
I'll leave that up to a power higher 
than my own. 

Now. there may possibly be a 
few out diere who nurture "bul what 
if they came from alcoholic -pareni- 
ed broken homes" theories? To 
these i say, "Get in touch with your 
severely oxygen-deprived inner 
common sense " They knew exactly 
what Ihey were doing. They knew 
dial they were breaking moral, as 
well as legal, codes. Could iijustt)e. 
perhaps, that dicy didn't feel like 
thinking that nigbl. only acting with 



bcasl-like demeanor? 

As far as my insurance policy 
coverage goes, yes, I'm covered for 
vandalism Whai this amounts lo is 
a major inconvenience for me I 
would, however, like to remind 
those cowardly punk-boys, and 
other limp-willcd pansies like diem, 
thai I'm not the only one they affect- 
ed: their behavior was self-damning 
in nature 

In other words, when their 
insurance rates unexpectedly rise in 
the fulure. I can only hope that 
diey'll recall how they only added 
to tlie problem when they vandal- 
ized my car; ihcy have no one lo 
blame but themselves for higher 
msurancc premiums. 

1 could expound on this subject 
and dehbcrate on the dire state of 
world alfajrs and ihc violent under- 
tones our daily lives have unwilling- 
ly adopted, and I probably will in a 
future column; but for now I'll 
close wiih a plea lo the ciUzcns of 
Fon Wayne and the surrounding 
area; please, if you're ever a witness 
to any sort of ciune, please call die 
police. Behave :a if you're the one 
who'd been victmiized. In the end, 
we all pay the pncc for any crime 
done unlo one of our neighbors.

who wouldn't be? It is, after ail. the 
great Amencan pastime 

Well, maybe not 

I can almost picture it now. The

I ever go back. 

Openmg day of the baseball sea- 
son was once considered to be on 
same level as a national holiday. 



There were parades in 
every major-league ciiy. 
Fans would line the 
streets and ticker-tape 
would cover them {(he 
streets). Now. opening 
day IS about as anUcipai- 
ed as the release of 
another "Fnday Uk 13th" 
movie. 

But seriously, 
what used lo be a major 
piei-e iif Americana has 
all too often become the 
punchline of smart-ass 
sports writers' jokes And 
deservedly so. 

Baseball was once the essence 
of innocence. It was about playing 
lor the love of the game — not 
aboul hocking a loogie in an 
umpire's fate Thai might be a bit 
naive of me, but what else is a

by Su^n Spindler 
Surr Writer 

All lie constnicbon. alJ ihc detoum and the 
loss of parking. All these problems will come to 
an end when construction is completed on the 
new science building 

The saence building has come a long way 
since the fall semester Science majors arc getting 
very anxious to use the new faciliiy. Bui will the 
rest of us gel lo enjoy i( for our required sci- 
ence courses' Will it be completed by ihe 
April 1998 deadline? 

The science budding will have cold rooms, a 
large computer lab. wet labs, some general class- 
rooms and a lecture hall ihai can 
hold 120 students 

According to IPFW Police Lieutenant 



Thomas Haner, the project will he 
finished on time 

"It will be completed m April 1998 of all ihe 
indications I've seen and heard." said Haner 

Liculenani Haner also says that ihe road to Ihe 
Police and Safety building will be oui of scrvite a 
couple days this week due to telephone lines 
being laid. If students need to go over there to 
pay a parking tine or pick up a permit, diey 
should park in back of the building and walk 
around to ihe front entrance The inconvenience 
should last a couple of days 

"The construcuon is on schedule." says Don 
Katter, physical plant director, "even though it 
doesn't appear to have changed on the exterior for 
a couple months " 

With the bad weather ihroughoui Fori Wayne. 
outside construction has been delayed. 



"With a break in the weather we should see the 
bricklayers come oui. " said Katter 

Although students cannot see the inside, there 
is progres' 

"The interior is going nghl along," says 
Kaitcr "The Cuw couple flows you can actually 
walk down ihe hallways." 

The science building will benem all science 
majors in chemistry, biology and 
the geo sciences. 

Plus, on the ground floor dierc are open com- 
puter labs that all students can use and some gen- 
eral purpose classrooms ihal may be used for 
math courses. 

If students are not science majors it does not 
mean thai ihey will not benefit from the new facil- 
ity All students will have the opponuniiy use the 
new science building.
