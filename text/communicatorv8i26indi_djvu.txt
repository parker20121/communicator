Can you 
be good at 
something 
you dorft 
believe in? 

Yes. 

You can be good at passing tests that are meaningless to you. 
You can be good at selling encyclopedias that you know are inferior 

Ultimately you can even be good at a profession that you 
don't really believe in. 

You can be good. But for some people, being good just isn't 
good enough. 

For the people who brew Busch beer, it isn't 
good enough. That's why, at Anheuser-Busch, we persist 
in brewing Busch beer just one way — the natural way 

We frankly believe that's the best way to brew beer 
And when you believe in what you're doing, 
you just naturally do it better 

Try a Busch. 

We believe you'll agree. 

BUSCH 



When you believe in what you're doing, 
you just naturally do it better.
