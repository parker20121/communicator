Vice chancellor of 
academic affairs 
also named 

Bv NoL Beckley 

Editor 



A faculty convocation has 
been called for Monday, 
Feb 16. in CM159 to con- 
sider whether to evaluate the perfor- 
mance of Chancellor Michael 
Warlell and Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Fenwick English. 

To call a faculty convocation, 20 
percent of the voting faculty must 
sign a petition calling a convocation. 

Bill Frederick, associate profes- 
sor of computer science, said 
although faculty convocations have 
met before, this is the first tune vot- 
ing faculty have petitioned to con- 
vene on (heir own. 

Michael Nusbaumer, associate 
professor of sociology and andiro- 
pology and one of the faculty who 
circulated the petition, said there ^e 
two goals he would like to see 
achieved at the faculty convocation. 

"Our concern is with a need to 
gel a belter understanding about 
what's going on," Nusbaumci said. 

The first goal is to get a wide 
variety of faculty input and to stop 
the hearsay ol the "rumor mill." 

Nusbaumer said there have been 
accusations flying back and forth 
among the faculty and between the 
faculty and the adimnistration 

He said certain people have 
been speaking for the faculty as a 
whole who may not have the author- 
ity to speak for the faculty. 

The second is to propose an 
evaluation of Wartell, who has been 
chancellor for three years, and 
English, who has been for vice chan- 
cellor of academic affairs for two 



not evaluated either since Ihey 
assumed Iheu positions. 

"It's very frustrating we [the 
faculty] haven't had an opportunity 
to evaluate them and that's simply 
what we're trying to do." 
Nusbaumer said. 

Faculty evaluate the heads of 
their department and the deans of 
their schools, but they do not evalu- 
ate the administration 

"I ihink that's unfair. They 
[admrnistrators] impact our situation 
as much as people closer to home 
[department heads and deans]," 
Nusbaumer said. 

Senate document 92-13. which 
has been in effect since December 
1992, put forth guidelines for the 
evaluation of administrators. 

The document says the evalua- 
tion of academic administrators 
should be voting faculty 

Voting faculty is generally 
tenure and tenure-track professors 
Deans are not considered voting fac- 
ulty. 

Frederick, presiding officer of 
the faculty senate, said there are 
many problems among die faculty 
and there needs to be some resolu- 
tion. 

Frederick said he would also be 
presiding over the convocation and 
would be neutral toward each side. 

'T want to be careful dial it's 
done well." Frederick said 

Frederick said there were many 
different issues and opinions being 
circulated by faculty and that may 
have created an uneasy feeling 
around campus. 

"It's chaouc at best , We've 
got to fmd resoluuon." Frederick 
said 

If the proposal is approved by 
the faculty, Speaker of the Indiana 
Faculty Mike Downs, Speaker of the 
Purdue Faculty Jim Hersberger and 
Presiding Officer of the Faculty 
Senate Bill Frederick will decide on 
the formal for faculty assessment of 
academic leadership by March 5 

There will be two discussions 
before the a&amp;sessment to be held on 



Feb. 23 and 
March 2. 

The fu^t will 
address "colle- 
giality and free- 
dom of expres- 
sion," 

The second 
will discuss the 
allocation of 
department 
resources and 
the effecLveness 
of academic 
leadership at 
IPFW 

After 




Michael 
Wartell 



he- 



assessments are collected on March 
16, Frederick. Downs and 
Henberger will collect the respons- 
es and report the resulLs to the facul- 
ty by Apnl 6 

These meetings will be held to 
"ensure a well-infonned and knowl- 
edgeable faculty," according to an e- 
mail sent out by the people who cir- 
culated the peution: Jane Grant, 
associate professor of pubhc and 
environmental affairs', Lucille Hess, 
associate professor of audiology and 
speech sciences; Richard Hess, asscv- 
ciate professor of commumcaiioni 
Nusbaumer; David Thuente, profes- 
sor of computer science; Mary 
Helen Thuente. chair and professor 
of English and linguistics; and 
Jeffrey Wilson, professor of psycho- 
logical sciences 

The final results will be present- 
ed ai the faculty senate meeting on 
April 13 

At faculty convocations, any 
item may be brought up for discus- 
sion and the senate, the chief admin- 
istrative officer of IPFW. die Board 
of Trustees and the presidents of 
both Indiana and Purdue may be 
petitioned for action by the voting 
faculty. 

The evaluation will be undertak- 
en in accordance with Senate 
Document 92-13. the full text is 
available on the senate homepage at:

-^■i^^'^fcs complainls 
m/I^^^^^^M about a mulli- 
^^^B^^^H aide of things 
^^^^^^^^H am a 
^^^^^^^1 believer a 

good complain- 
ing session can be very hcallby. but 
what about tecognizing the things we 
actually like about Ufe? 

Often. I like to think about the lit- 
de things that put a smile on my (ace. 
When things look down. 1 turn to 
thoughts that make me happy 

i think everyone could use a 
good walk through happy times 
Unforlunaiely. we raR-ly have die 
time to do so. Today. I ask you to 
think about the diuigs that make you 
tiuly happy. Kind of a "stop and 
smell the loscs" adventure 

One of die mam ihmgs I love arc 
happy people. Not incredibly, dis- 
gustingly happy people, but sweetly 
and cheerfully happy people I love 
to see their sincere smiles aiKJ bear 
their joyful laughter. Sometimes ii 
just n^es things a liidc bit better for 
me to realize ihat someone else is 
happy, even if I'm struggling with it 

To some, happy people are 
annoying To me. they are a reason to 
be happy 

Anoihei thing I love to do is stop 
in the middle of a parking lot or open 
area and look around me. It does not 
matter if it's in die middle of a winter 
storm or if its 80 degrees outside, I 
can almost always find something 
pe%:eful m the world 

I was at work when die first 
snowfall of the season came 
Everyone warned me about driving 
safely and die cold temperatures For 
hours, all 1 did was complain about 
having to go outside in the dreaded 
sQow. When my shift was over with, 
I stepped close to the door and before 
I walked out. I mumbled insults to 
the snow. But. as I first walked out 
into the cold, a certain peace and 



calmness overwhelmed me and I 
soon smiled towards the sky as 1 real- 
ized bow beautiful the world truly is. 
It made me happy. 

Ldtc many others, I also love 
music Even some of the truly 
depressing songs make me look 
deeply into life and overall give me a 
happy feeling. Songs remind me of 
people and things in die past. Some 
of these memories are ligbtheaiied 
and pleasant, others are somewhat 
somber and melancholy in thought. 
Even though some songs remind me 
of times when diings were bad. I can 
usually find something about them to 
be happy about. Sometimes it's as 
simple as a diankful diought diat 1 
was able to spend lime with a person 
radicr than focus on how much I miss 
diem. 

Another thing I love is to observe 
infants and the elderly I feel that diey 
are quite inlrigumg Infants are at the 
beginning stages of life and have so 
mucli to look forward lo experienc- 
ing. The elderly, on the odier hand. 
have so much to offer because they 
have such a knowledge that no one 
else can compare 

When 1 see babies, I think about 
what they will become and what their 
hves will be like. When 1 see an 
elderly person. I'm curious about 
what they have already accomphshed 
in life It's very enlightening to real- 
ize these two extremes of life 

These are just a few of my 
"happy dimgs" and hope that you 
will come up with some of your own. 
There are a lot of things to be happy 
about. Unforlunately, Ide is just too 
busy sometimes to recognize the 
happy times. It is a whole lot easier to 
be bogged down by the not-so-happy 
times and I jusidon't diinkUiai that's 
a very good thing. 

Sure, diere's a lot to be stressed 
about, but there's a lot to enjoy and 
be happy about too.

"I love Ihee. 
I love but Ihee. 
W/A a love Ihai shall not die 
Till the sun grows cold. 
And the stars old. 

And the leaves o/ihe Judgment Book 
unfold'" 
"Bayard Taylor. Bedouin Song 

I can't remember the last time 
that I told you that I love you 

Today I sal alone, as is my usual 
custom, diinking about sad things 1 
was regretting choices again, and 
this time. I realized how much I 
regret all die diings I've never .said. 
Things 1 should have said to you. 
There are so many diings that 1 could 
have said, that 1 should have said. 
that I meant to say — but didn't 

There were times when I stood 
by quiedy. watching you hun. and I 
should have said something, but 
chose to let silence work its magic 
on the moment and spare me from 
having to put feelings into language. 
The thought was still there — you 
knew that — but I guess that 1 fe^^ 
thai my words wouldn't be profound 
enough to "fix" the ache that had 
invaded your soul. You know bow 
much I like to fix things Especially 
for you, 

1 guess dial I feel frightened 
when I can't be die saviour thai I've 
always been for you. I've taken on 
that role now for so many years that 
it shames me when I fail to fulfill die 
expectaiion. Maybe I need to let you 
be my saviour for once. Maybe I just 
can't fix everyihing, try as I mighL 

But I sull dunk about all diose 
times when my voice could have 
comforted you. Those tunes when 
even some boring cliche' might have 
made your bean stronger, if even for 
a moment Just a momeni. Moments 
can last so very long. And so can 
regrets. 



So I want you to know that I love 
you. I truly, deeply and completely 
love you. 1 love you from die depdis 
of my very soul to ihe reaches of die 
universe that enfolds us 1 don't want 
to legrel not saying thmgs. Not one 
more 



Is diere anyone else who is hav- 
ing deja-vu concerning the situation 
in Iraq"* Well, wc were having trou- 
ble remembering if this is 1991 or 
1998, because we seem to be in the 
throes of the same problems with 
Saddam that we were in seven years 
ago. 

We believe that the problem 
should have been dealt with long 
ago. And the scary ihuig is, that 
according to news reports we tried to 
eliminate Saddam twice before and 
failed. Uh. that's right we don't set 
out to assassinate people, we try to 
"solve" the unstable situations 
Whatever 

ApparenUy, the CIA had a '"no 
lose" plan to "solve" the situation in 
the Persian Gulf, but diey Iosl So 
now. here we are dealing with 
Saddam again and losing our 
patience agam 

We diink that Qiere has to be a 
way to nd the world of Saddam and 
yet sull gel our hands on all dial oil 

Aside from bombing the bell out 
of the country and killing everyone 
the options are somewhat limited. 

And we aren't ready to be 
responsible for all the children dial 
woulddie They don'thaveachoice. 
Thai IS a choice to get out of die 
counuy, to exercise their individual 
beliefs and truly understand what 
this IS all about. 

Although, who knows if any 
Iraqi truly understands what is going 
on, they know only what Saddam 



lets them know. That would be 
everything anu-Amencan 

But never fear We brilliant 
minds at The Communicator have 
the answer. 
Fust, put an ad 
in -Soldier of 
Fortune" adver- 
tising for a mer- 
cenary, 

The ad 
should read 
"WANTED 
Head of thi 
leader of prof- 
itable oil coun- 
try Reward: S

Next, we 
sift duough the 
thousands of 
replies and 
select our 
Ram bo. 

Now, 
Rambo is sent 
off on his mis- 
sion and with 
the motivation 
of SI million

sure to succeed, 

Or belter yet. we make diis a

one have a chance at the million 
Whoever returns home with the sub- 
head gCL^ dif pn/L-

with the mission is diat it must be 
earned out after the Olympics. 

Because we aren't tacky 
and we don't want to spod ihe cov- 
erage of the 
Olympics We 
want this "solu- 
Uon" to be a posi- 
tive one. 

And in 
order to drum up 
support for our 
Rambo's success, 
let's not have Ihe 
General's and 
Secretary of 
Defense give the 
updates, but radier

present tune) to do 

TOR HAVE THE ■'„' f"',';'' %\ 

commentary We 
A ^ tr^\Air—i~v can hear it now, "A 

ANSWER. bomb going down- 

town. .YES!" 
Another idea is 
dial we take all the 
inmaies on deadi 
row. suit 'em up in 
fatigues, drop 'em in the desert and 
supply them with maps, knifes, guns 
and ammo. We would train them 
through boot camp, but we figure the 
killer instinct is airead) there 

l"h.-ir rcuard v.ouUi ht ck-men- 



But never 

FEAR. We 

brilliant 
minds at the 
communica- 



cy. And if dial's not moUvaiion we 
aren't sure what is. 

Or we could pay another country 
to lake care of this ever present prob- 
lem. 

For instance, how aboul the 
Irish Thos£ folks have been at war 
longer than most of us have been 
alive. If there is anyone thai knows 
how to fight and fight dirty, it would 
be the Insh. 

Plus, wasn't it Israel that 
Saddam had all his missiles aimed ai 
last tune' Didn't we ask diem not lo 
retaliate against Saddam when he 
dropped a few within Iheir bound- 
anes' 

We think it's payback time for 
the Irish, ihey may now pass "GO," 
coUeci S2 bdLon dollars and take the 
bead of Saddam. 

Basically, we are tired of the 
confrontations between us and 
Saddam. 

Saddam is only one man. how 
difficult can il be to suppress him 
and deflate bis reign over the Middle 
East. 

Not only should we be able to 
slop him, but we should be able to 
get our mits on that oil, not that 
dial's what it's all about. It's about 
Saddam threatening the safely of 
much of Ihe world's population. And 
that's unacceptable

Hey America, are you up to speed on the issues? 



Wfiat's WeaH tfils Wee£; Dennis Donadue 



Have you noticed a'ccnUy ihat 
people (Jon'i follow legiiiinaii; 
news? Sure, it's deprt."ising and all. 
but n ii ihai you jusi don'i care? 

ir you Ihink ii docsn'l a/Tcci 
you. you're wrong. Almosi every- 
thing thai happens in ihis world 
could bave an impaci on our lives. 
Bui would ii bun lo follow an 
important story like tie Persian 
Gulf crisis? 

I realize the "local" press isn't 
exactly the best, but being ignoranl 
is no excuse. I have like, five read- 
ers, uicluding my friends, ihat fol- 
low my column. That's okay, 'cause 
I'm not the news. I'm just a guy 
with an opinion. 

You could expect more from an 
Englisb or journalism major. They 
know what they're doing. I don't, 
so I just wing it. I do like to com- 
plain a lot. I think it keeps people 
honest. 1 also beheve that there are 
B iol of bad things in the world, i do 
not consider myself a pessimist, just 
a cynic 

However, the fact remains, 
keeping up on issues makes a per- 
son well-rounded. More people 
know who Michael Jordan is than 
Al Gore, and that's pretty sad 
Maybe spons is more important 



than politics, but when has an All- 
Star signed a treaty Remember the 
less you know, the worse off you 
are 

Even when I sec Iraqis bummg 
American flags and chanting anti- 
American slogans. I think to 
myself, "At least they arc together, 
as a country, showing national 
pride." even if it is at our expense. 

We have sports fans, that's 
about it. Yippee, my icain won and 
you like my team, so I hke you. 

What makes us a strong coun- 
try? Can we have the romantic feel- 
ings of World War II ever again? 
Will the innocence of our children 
ever be protected? What do we have 
to look forward to? I can only imag- 
ine a future that thrives on selfish- 
ness and contempt. Great attitude, 
huh. 

It was only 30 years ago that we 
were turning dogs and fire hoses on 
our Afnc an -American brothers and 
sisters. 

l~hiny years doesn't seem hkc 
a long time ago, because it wasn't 
We try \o understand what hap- 
pened and it seems very difriculi. 
Where did we screw up? Are the 
politicians to blame, or the citizens? 
Is ii right 10 blame the 



President for our nation's woes? No 
one person is ever responsible. 

How about blaming the non- 
voters? They are responsible for not 
participating in our democratic 
process. But can wc blame ihem? 
And people tell me to quit hitching! 
Hey, at least I vole. 

Can we a]IJusigetalong?Ic:an. 
but only if you let me. I don't care 
what color you are. 

As long as there are members of 
society dedicated to separating 
themselves from others, there will 
always be conflict. 

And you know what else? As 
long as there is the Ku Klux Klan. 
there are gomg to be a bunch of 
anti-whiic groups. 

So if you're white, don't get all 
righteous about your race, and if 
you're black, remember whites are 
allowed to have pnde too 

But violence is still a terrible 
element Don't take race so serious- 
ly. We all act like we get along but 
we need to try just a little harder. It 
is aimo.M easier to hate these days. 
Everyone is looking out for them- 
selves. The "me" generation is back 
and it's not very happy 

Look at the adveriising, "Tvio 
for me, none for you" rings one 



lelevision ad for candy O, "Second 
place sucks " It would appear harm- 
less, but remember your generation 
and the one bchmd it will absorb 
everything The "X" in "GeneraUon 
X" stands for Xtra naive 

I thmk we can blame that on 
poor parcntmg. In fact, lets blame 
everything on adults Why do peo- 
ple drive so bad? Because an adult 
taught them 

Why do so many children stan 
smoking^ Because an adult in dieir 
life said It was okay How come 
violent crime amongst teenagers is 
at an all ume high? My guess is the 
lack of love from an adult 

I wish I could look the other 
way when another child is killed 
because some moron left his loaded 
gun in a place within reach. 

And when a 15-year-old gets 
pregnant, 1 wish I could just pray 
for them and make it all better 

It's okay to drink, just don't 
drive. Condoms in schools? Might 
as well, they'll have sex regardless 
See. wc have taught people that 
wrong IS okay. There are just dif- 
ferent levels of wrong. Like, "don't 
hit your sister" But how about, 
"don't hit anyone? " 

I'll just sit around, hoping that 



today's parents rcali/e what is hap- 
pening to our country They are the 
ones who can make Ji belter 

With Asian, Hispanic, African. 
European and other races and reli- 
gions still reaching our borders, we 
wiL soon have to decide what the 
future holds Indeed, wc are all dif- 
ferent, but we can get along It real- 
ly shouldn't be this difficult and yet 
somehow it is Since ignorant peo- 
ple don't read, they will not sec this 
It is up to you. 

Our political system cannot be 
saved, nor can our couns. Voting is 
still something I feel proud of 
doing, even if the candidates are 
weak At least 1 have a made a 
choice I can't protest for you. You 
can make a difference, but you need 
to get off your butt to make it hap- 
pen. 

I'm sick of everyone blaming 
"society " for all of Americas prob- 
lems. We are the society. E)on't 
show me another picture of a modi- 
cr wailing at her dead gang-banger 
son's funeral I feel bad for her to a 
point, but where was she when he 
realized that he needed to join a 
gang to be loved? 

So go ahead, tune it out. Those 
of us that know will be ready when 



It all comes down And police bru- 
tality^ Hey. you break the law. so 
you waive your nghts as far as I'm 
concerned 

Corrupt government? Vote 'em 
out. Participate. Read a freakin' 
paper every once in a while Go vol- 
unteer at a homeless shelter Go lo 
church. 

Remember what Kennedy said, 
"Ask not what your country can do 
for you. ask what you can do for 
your country." 

LOSER OF THE WEEK: 

The media. Us. The written and 
televised word Where do they get 
off on this Lewinsky thing? I don't 
think this is very important news. 
I've seen more interesting topics on 
Springer, 

Let's hope that she is lying and 
it will all be over widi. This is 
wor^e than the OJ coverage. 

Frankly, I can .see why people 
don't watch the news anymore It is 
depressing. 1 agree. So regarding 
what 1 said before, well, never 
mind Go dnnk a Mountain Dew, 
watch "The Real Worid" and the 
informed folks will keep you 
posted. 



Cloning: d questionable activity ? 



wdat I TfiinU: Heidi HeinecHe, guest columnbi 



Cloning became big news when 
a scientist from Sweden successful- 
ly cloned a sheep. I reccnUy beard 
that a cow was also cloned. It's very 
scary to think we have this technol- 
ogy 

If President Clinton bans 
cloning in the United States. 
Richard Seed, a scientist from 
Chicago, has said he wUl go some- 
where else to clone humans He 
advocated for his position in a tele- 
vision interview by pointing out that 
there are couples unable to have 
children who would probably wel- 
come an opportunity to have a child 

But I beheve cloning isn't the 
answer There are many children up 
for adoption who feel unloved and 
unwanted. Don't they deserve a 
chance to be pan of a family? 
Biology doesn't make a family, life 
does. 

Cloning cheapens the value of 
life in a sense because there will 
come a time, maybe very soon, in 
which children will be made to 
order. I think sperm banks already 
come close to that because it's pos- 
sible to choose family and medical 
background, level of education, eco- 
nomic staiu.s, height and eye color 
of a potential father, more so than 
matters of the heart and letting 
nature take its course 

Cloning an animal or a human 
being just because we can makes no

sense lo me. If this new scientific 
technology could be used to help 
people, for example, provide organs 
for donauon, help cure AIDS, can- 
cer or muscular dystrophy, then it 
has a purpose. But. someone, some- 
where could still use it to huri peo- 
ple. 

In the wrong hands, this tech- 
nology could annihilate the human 
race and replace us with a "superior 
race." Hitler tried it once. Do you 
want to nsk thai again? 1 don't. 

We could end up with more 
deformities that are more devastat- 
ing than we have now with just let- 
ting nature take its course. At what 
point do we attempt to fix the defor- 
mities? After birth or during cell for-

chJdren in petri dishes to guarantee 
perfection? I believe we have ill- 
nesses and birth defects for a reason .

(Should you see Great Expectations? 
Only if you've never read the book 



Cinema Center offers 
Saturday matinees 



By G*]l Rusle Crawford 
News Eoctor 



For the last several years. 'The 
Powcn Thai Be" in Hollywood- land 
seem to have decided ibai we 
Americans need some lessons in 
grcai liierature. These movie-mogul- 
giants have taken II upon thcnisclvcs 
to teach us all ^x&gt;ul the books we 
should have read when we were in 
junior bigb or high school. 

This is the result: many of the 
greatest books of the last several 
ccniiines have been destroyed; these 
directors have lumed them into big- 
budget disasters that are either so 
boring that no one actually goes to 
see them or have nothing to do with 
the classic books from which ibey 
were conceived, 

ITiis is fine by me because most 
of these movies are based on books 
which were sheer disappointments 
to me, anyway I love Uicraiure. but 
some of the so-called "greatest 
books" of all time just don't seem all 
Uiai great. My two favorite literature 
"disappotntmenu" arc Moby Dick 
and Greai Eipeaasions. the latta of 
which IS the basis of a new movie 

Great Expectations, playing 
now at Coldwaier Crossing and 
Coventry theaicrs, is a movie that 
lakes a few creative liberties with 
Charles Dickens' original novel and 
leaves the stu^y original version in 
iLs leather binding on a shelf some- 
where. Sadly, it's much more inter- 
esting that way 

It seems that Hollywood direc- 
tors arc right: we will only pay for 
viewing movies that aren't dusty and 
bonng. which is what we fear much 
classic literature is We like modern- 
ized vereions of Uie books thai we 
hated when we were younger 

Great Expeciaiions. the mo\ie, 
stars acior-director-novel-wnter- 
wannabe Ethan Hawke as Finn, a 
painter who grows up somewhere on 
the Gulf Coast o( Florida. The first 
lines heard in the movie are: "I'm 
not going to tell it as it happened; 
I'm going to tell it as 1 remember it" 
What follows IS a story that spans 
between fifteen and twenty years 
(Finn is the movie's incarnation of 
Dickens' Pip. in case you haven't 
read the novel since you were 15. 
like me) 

Finn spends his childhood draw- 
ing fish and the ocean and hves with 
his sister and her husband. One day 
he happens to be m the wrong place 
at the wrong ume lor. as you'll have 
to decide later, the nghs place ai the 
nghi time) and encounters an 
escaped convict, played by Robert 
E&gt;e Niro Finn does something nice 
for this mean man-on-the-njn, but 
the man is later arrested Fuin's life 
goes on and he doesn't think very 
much about the encounter. 

Important Note: If you're a big 
De Niro fan, and go to see this 
movie just to see De Niro — don't 



He's in the movie for less than thirty 
irunules He shows up at the begin- 
ning, makes a two-second appear- 
ance in the middle and dis^pears 
agam until the end of the movie 
He's an important figure, he just 
dosn'l get a lot of screen time. 

Nol too long after this 
encounter, Finn is asked by the resi- 
dent local nutcase, Ms. Dinsmoor. 
to play with her niece. Esiella. Ms, 
Duismoor Ls the movie's equivclant 
loMs Havisham, having been left at 
the allM by her husband-to-be on her 
wedding day, she went insane short- 
ly thereafter Everything at her man- 
sion, including the decc^aied front 
yard, is exactly the same as the day 
of the stilled event 

Ms Dinsmoor is a creepy lady^, 
she wears some frightening makeup 
and, for lack of a better description, 
interesting, wigs Anne Bancroft is 
absolutely hysterical as the man-bat- 
ing Ms Dinsmoor, Believe me, 
you'll find it hard to stop singing 
"Besame Mucho" after you leave 
the theater 

Although beautiful and cultured. 
Esiella (the ever-beautiful Gwyneih 
Paltrow) is not a charmer. She's rude 
and snobbish to Finn from the 
moment she lays eyes on bim He. 
however, thmks she's as preity as a 
ten year-old can possibly be. He 
paints a poruaii of her and she casu- 
ally throws it aside The two become 
reluctani playmates, and Ms, 
Dmsmoor teaches them how to ball- 
room dance 

She tells Finn, "The girl will 
only break your hean, but you'll still 
pursue her." It lums out that she's 
teaching Estella to be a "tease" — 
Ejtella is lemming to lure men in and 
then drop them cold once she has 
their beans, Ms. Dinsmoor is trymg 
to reap revengt on alt men because 
of what one man did to her and poor 
httle Finn is a pawn in her selfish 
game. 

Flash-forward lo about seven 
years later (the movie blurs the time 
frame, which is really confusing). 
Finn and Esiella are now teenagers 
and have one brief "moment" 
together; 1 won't dare call it roman- 
iic. but I will call it erotic. Afier this 
moment. Esiella disappears, and 
Finn is so distraught that he slowly 
ceases painting. He decides that 
he'll be a risherman. like bis uncle, 
and spends a few years trying lo fmd 
bis place in the world. 

One day. a lawyer approaches 
Finn and tells him that he has been

HIV/AIDS 

Q&amp;A 



Q. Can you get AIDS 
from a toilet seat? 

A. No, because even if 
the HIV virus could 
survive on a toilet 
seat, it would have to 
be able to enter the 
bloodstream in order 
for a person to 
become infected. 



To have your qu 
about HIV/AIDS ans

given financial backing by an 
anonymous donor to finance an 
eihibii of his work at a famous 
Manhattan gallery. Finn assumes 
that Ms Dinsmoor is his backer 
when he visits her at her still-deteri- 
orating mansion, she tells him that 
Estella is m New York. Figuring that 
this is pan of her "plan." he goes to 
New York to paini and make hLs 
future He assumes that be is to 
become a famous painter doing so 
would make him a social equal with 
Esiella and he'd have a better 
chance of snagging her affections 

Within a short pcnod, Finn 
arrives in New York and begins 
painting furiously lo fill up the space 
at his premiering show. He runs into 
Estella in, of all places, Central Park 
O've been to Central Park, and have 
no idea how anyone can run into 
anyone that easily in that place — 
it's huge), the two share an interest- 
ing, water-fountain drink (you just 
have to see that dnnk lo understand 
why I call it inieresiingK talk and 
soon Finn is hanging out with 
Estella's nch, snobby friends and 
fiance 

Yep. folks, she's engaged. Ms 
Dinsmoor just happens 10 keep thai 
little tidbit of infonnation away 
from Finn Finn is shaken with his 
discovery, but complies when 
Estella a.sks him to paint a new por- 
uaii of her He's so obsessed with 
her that he'll do anything just to see 
her one more time. 

Estella shows up ai Finn's apan- 
menioneday and takes off all of her 
clothes. Finn can barely hold a 
paintbrush, let alone paint, as she 
stands in front of a wmdow. Once he 
composes himself, he is so inspired 
that he paints for hours As before, 
Esiella abruptly gives him the cold 
shoulder and leaves Finn alone with 
only his thoughts and his obsession 
for company 

Finn's life continues its upward 
waltz as his art opening approaches. 
His mysterious benefactor gives him 
a large studio apartment, an 
allowance and preliy much anything 
that he needs. Finn decides that be 
needs publicity to make his opening 
do well and becomes a media 
machine He makes up stones about 
his childhood, joins an elite grouop 
of arlist-lype fnends and just gener- 
ally becomes a social climber. He 
does all this because he thinks he'll

had promised to come to the open-

way, actually likes Finn), Finn is vis- 
ibly disiraughi by her absence His 
uncle comes to ihe opening and 
embanasses Finn Finn deserves it. 
though, because he told everyone 
that ins uncle was dead. 

Finn gets a heavy dose of realily 
and tries lo make amends with his 
uncle, bui it docsn'i work Finn then 
leaves his own opening and looks 
for Estella. The two have a passion- 
ate one-nighi affair, and — you 
guessed it, Esiella disappears again 
Finn finds out from nutty old Ms 
Dinsmoor, who has moved lo 
Mahatian, thai Estella has gone to 
Pans 10 get married. Finn is 
destroyed. 

Dg Finn and Estella ever gel 
together? Does Finn become 
famous? I&gt;oes Finn ever find out 
who his benefactor is? How the heck 
did crazy Ms, Dinsmoor get custody 
of Esiella in the first place (oh, wail, 
the movie never answers that)? Does 
Estella's hean ever get removed 
from Ihe Frigidaire that it is 
enclosed in? Do any of those lawn 
decorations in the Florida mansion 
ever actually deteriorate ' 

To find these answers and more, 
you'll jusi have to see the movie. 
However. I'd recommemend nol 
reading the book anytime near your 
viewing time. 

Great Expectations, the movie, 
won't change your life. It won't get 
you a better grade in English Lit, 
And it surely won't make you appre- 
ciate Dickens Believe me, I've tried 
that repeatedly But it will make a 
great date movie for Valentme's Day 
or pretty much any other day, Ii's 
about obsessions, lost love and 
choices The.se are things that every- 
one can identify with 

Now if only someone could

The lights dim as the small the- 
ater's projector begins lo flicker 
The crowd finishes their conversa- 
tions quickly as their eyes focus on 
the screen 

Soon, ihey will be wimess to 
some an film or foreign film rarely 
heard about behind the relative 
fortress of the Bible Bell 

The Cinema Center. 437 E 
Berry St , has featured the most 
talked about independent films in 
the industry. Films like "In the 
Company of Men." "Kenneth 
Branagh's Hamleu" "11 Poslino" 
and "Clerks" have all made their 
exclusive Eon Wayne theatrical 
run at the Cinema Cenier. 

"We try to keep a variety of 
independent, classic, foreign and 
documeniary films," Rich Lee. 
theater manager said. 

Lee said the number 
one criteria if a film will 
play at the center is 
whether or not the film 
has played in 
Fon Wayne. 

Recently, 
the S I u c n I 
Activities 
Board (SAB) 
and Ihe center 
cut a deal for students and fac- 
ulty to gel into the theater for 
only SI, which is S2 below 
the regular admission price. 

Matinees will be 
shown at 2 p.m. amd 4 
p.m. on Saiudays, 

The Cinema Cenier 
has never offered 



Saturday matinee before, Lee said, 
■Its a little unusual for our 
regular customers." Lee said 

The maunec special will run 
through the end of the semester 
and maybe even continue next 
semesier 

"We hope lo perhaps renew die 
deal we have,"' Lee said, 

Lee said most of the films that 
run at [he Cinema Center are ones 
that have not run at any theater in 
Fon Wayne, 

Attendance at the matinees ha.s 
been rising each week. Lee said. 

The concession stand docs not 
feature the usual cavity inducing 
fare of Sno-Caps, Mike n' Ikes or 
Good n' Ptenly. 

They sell popcorn, candy- 
esque granola-like bars and bever- 
ages like Evian or canned soda 
pop. 

The theater also features the 
only union projec- 
tionisi in die city 
since Regal 
Cinemas decid- 
ed to make do 
without profes- 
sional projec- 
tionists within 
Ihe last year 

The 

Cinema Cenier 

IS a non-profit 

organization and has 

only two paid staff 

members. 

This week the 

Cinema Cenier is 

showing "'Kiss

The objeci of ihe game ii f or a 
blindfolded individual to caicb and 
identify anoiher individual 

The Student Activities Board 
(SAB) caught Bhnd Man's Bluff to 
pcrfonn ai IPFW for an afternoon 
of cntenainmcm last Monday after- 
noon 

Blind Man's Bluff is composed 
of Chaz Ruhl. David Wilner. Drew 
Breen and Nick Geisinger. both 
originally from the east coast. This 
Chicago-based group powerfully 
performs covers and original music, 
aca^Klla rock style 

This new-10-IPFW talent is 
something thai few people have 
ever heard of The band. Blind 
Man's BIu^, originated about seven 
years ago. Ilie original members 
eventually decided they warned to 
split up, but did not want to get nd 
of the group completely. Instead 
diey wanted 10 find a younger set of 
guys to overtake the name. 

The band went through llux 
times as the group reformed until 
David was contacted by the original 
members of the band around 
January 1997 asking if he was inter- 
ested in bccommg involved He 
began placing 
audition adver- 
tisements over 
the Internet 
which is how 
Drew and Nick 
joined up with 
the group. Both 
Nick and David 
were big names 
in music at their 
colleges, so they 
had beard of 
each other 
before they actu- 
ally met It is 
somewhai con- 
fusing bow Chaz 
became a mem- 

bcr of ibc group Blind Mans Blull: 
He was no. one „,^^ 
of Ihe original 

members, however did join about a 
year before David was contacied 
while the group was going through 
{]\i% times David convinced Ruhl 
stay with the group as it started 

So, what is the excitement that 
these gentlemen bring to the stage? 
For ssancrs. ihey simply put on a 
great show Their inaudible talent 
i^ quickly noticed even before the 
first half of a song is completed. 
Each member is rather versatile in 
their vocal abilities which enables 
them 10 pcrfoim various song types 
and styles. 

"We are like a mixuire of pop, 
funk and R&amp; B," David said 

This group's performances are 
not what most audiences are used 
to. When hearing Bhnd Man's Bluff 
for the first time, chances are ihcy 
aa' hearmg a cappella rock for the 
first lime also. 

"It's cool to sec the responses 
from the audiences," I&gt;avid said 
"Since a cappcUa rock is such a 
unique style, most people are 
amazed by what we accomplish It 
IS a very fun style to perform " 

Another highlight of their per- 
formances is that they sing songs 
faniiliai and enienaining for all 
ages. Throughout the school year. 
these college graduates mostly per- 
form at colleges nationwide. 

Blind Man's Bluff auditioned to 
showcase m front of the National 
Association of Campus activities 
(NAC) of die midwcsiem districL 
At this showcasing, a representauve 
from each college in the district 
attends to find entertainment acts to 
perform at their college. If a band 
perfcffms at an NAC concert, many 
colleges quickly know about them 



Blind Man's BlufT tours nation- 
ally throughout the school vear, but 
stays in Chicago to play at die many 
city summer festivals 

In concert, the best thing about 
this group is the audience can lell 
Lhey truly love what they arc doing. 
One of the most cntcrlaining 
aspeas of their show is a complete- 
ly improvised song The guys ask 
for eight words from the audience 
and they have to come up with a 
song using the eight words in it It 
allows for some rather off-the-wall 
stories, which adds even more 
humor and challenges the band's 
creativity as well. 

Last October, the group 
released their first CD entitled 
"Shades." This CD includes a vari- 
ety of cover songs as well as one of 
their originals 

"This is something we are very 
proud of," David said. "For a group 
to put out a CD after only being 
together for about a year is really 
somediing. None of ibe pnor Blmd 
Man's Bluff groups have put 
together a CD. We're really proud 
of what we have done so far." 

Blind Man's Bluff sings many 
covers, but they also perform sever- 
al originals. Tiey usually perform 
most of their originals in concert. 
however they decided to stick widi 




from left: Chaz, Nick, David and 

familiar songs for the Monday 
afternoon concert 

Throughout the day, the guys 
are either singing or playing music. 
Off stage, their music tastes vary 
David enjoys the typical Top 40 
tunes, but is slowly getting pulled 
into Ustening to country music by 
Drew and Nick. Drew and David 
said that Chaz won't go near coun- 
try music, so when they arc togeth- 
er, they often hsten to the usual 
favorites such as; Matchbox 20, 
Red Hot Chili Peppers. Indigo Girls 
and Savage Garden Theu* music 
includes these bands of the 90's as 
well as many liked songs from the 
80-s. 

The group's main goal of their 
performances is to keep the audi- 
ence cnienained By singing famd- 
lar songs, the audience can sing 
along and dance to their favorite 
songs 

"We want people to have a 
good lime," David said "It's fun for 
us and we like to see other people 
having fun too. People dancing 
around or laughing at things like 
our improvised songs are what it's 
all abouL It's supposed to be fun " 

These Windy City-itcs are usu- 
ally home once a week and already 
have a busy schedule for spring. To

Mens tennis smiling on future 



By Tony Laux 
sports e0&lt;tor 

Head Coach J Webb Honon is 
all smiles when he looks at bis ten- 
nis team. With last year's seventh 
place finish in the Great Lakes 
Valley Conference (GLVC), he feels 
thai be has a solid team thai should 
contend for an upper division Tuiisb 

Tbe members of the team thai he 
will be looking for to lead the way 
are team captain Rob Moreland, 
Damn Strayer and Kayle Davis, 
who returns (o the team after a year 
ID the Marines 

EvCT with a team that is rclativ- 
ly young. Horton thinks thai his 
team's positive mental attitude will 
be his team's strength 

"This team is mentally tougher 
than last year's team Menial tough- 
ness will play a role in wuining 
some matches Ibal arc close." 
Horton said 



llie tough matches that will tesi 
his learns mental toughness will be 
against the University of 
Indianapolis m March and Soutbcm 
llhnois- Edwards ville in April 

With only twelve matches. 
every one will count "The key is 
not lo lose to die teams that we arc 
supposed lo beai."said Horton 

Last year's team was 6-6 but 
they should see an improvement 
with the additions of Todd Fiwick, 
Brady Spangler, Ed Sera, a graduate 
siudeni. andOren Shavilt. "If all of 
our people play hke they arc capa- 
ble, we are going lo have a good sea- 
son." Honon said. 

Anodier plus thai should help 
the (cam is the schedule since eight 
of the 12 matches wiU be held ai 
home 

The loughesl matches are also 
spread apan by about a month so die 
team should be able to use the earli- 
er matches to tunc up and work out 
any klnk^
