Title IX ruling 
won't change 
IPFW sports 

Bj DAVT LUEGRISC 
Slnir Wfllf r 

Titlf [X. Ihc tcdcral law thai provides seiual equality in educalion. may be 
rdnlFTpraed Iflht Reagan odministralion has ils "ay. 

■nife IX reads as tollowsr "No person in the UnllHiSlalcs shall, on the basts of 
sra, \x excluded (rom pirticipalion in, be denied benefit o(, or be subletted lo 
discrimination under any program or ncllvily receiving federal financial 
assistance," 

Tlio pro blctn cenlers around wo issues. Firat is whether fedcralald to a student 
ojunts as aid lo a privnle school Secondly, and most controversial, is wheUier 
Title IX applies lo entire inslitulions or individual departments of tliose In^ 

A case involving a small independent college in Perusyivania has brought Title 
IX, part ol Ihc Education Amendment of IW!. back inio the news The Supreme 
tiourt currently has Ihe case under review, with n decision due within a couple oJ 

Tlie case involves Grove City (jillege, which in 1976, rotusedlo goalong with title 
IX. Because Grove Cily College doesn't receive federal money, attorneys 
rcprescnUngthecollegeargueilshouldh'lhavetoeomply with Title Dt. 

Allomeys also say Grove Cily College voluntarily ma inl Bins c&lt;|ua lily (or women 
in educalion. 

In 1978. after Grove City would not sign forms agreeing to comply wilh Title K. 
Ihe Depanmoil of Education withdrew all federal funds to Grove Cily's students. 
The college and several students fded suit, but lost the case. 

GroveCity has taken the case 10 Ihe SuprcmeCouriaflcrseveralaHMals were 
dcfeaied .-—---- 

If Ihe court rules In tnvor of Grove City, in&lt;|lvldua] departments thai do not 
rccei^'e federal funds would nal have In abide ty Title IX, which means many 
Blhlelic programs Ihat have emerged since I9T2 for women could be elimlnaled. 
School athletic programs mighl be in jeopardy, since most do not receive lederoi 
support. 

IPFW athletic director David Skellon beliei-es no changes would occur in IP- 
FW's alhlelic dcpanmenl. 

"We would not drop any programs, " Skellon said "Our mat's and women's 
programs at IPFlVhavegroWTi logether." 

The Reagan Administration Is supporting the Grove City side of the case. The 
adminislraUon says il does nol support discrimination, bin wants the Inw lo be 
readas precisely as possible. 

Bad tasting fruit 
found on campus 

By K.P.WILLIAMS 
Stall Writer 

Do you remember Ihc slory about Adam and Eve and Ihe apple? Do you 
remember, too, that the apple was from Ihe tree of knowledge? Well, I found thai 
"iret" Il Is nghl hereon campus, and belieie me, if you lasle thai fruit you will 
comeawoy with some very real knowledge — guaranlecdt 

Now, people who know me well know that I've lived pretty close to nalure for a 
ltd of year^ and when I am outdoors, 1 am iiuitc conscious of my surroundings. I 
become evea more to Ihe further from d viliia tion I gel. 

So, Ihc day 1 spied those pear shaped trulls lying on the ground around that hlUe 
buih, 1 knew they weren't from a plant native to this area; lalsoltnewlbatldidn't 
know whallhey were. 

Pocketing three of them, 1 decided to find oul what they were, and to see IT I 
could grow one nf Ihe iHishes. I knew my green thumb had a congenital defect and 
Blrophied at litrth. so if anything at all grew, il would be In spite of. rather than 
because of me. I Just thought I'd try anyway 

After iwo months of poking around Irying to figure out what the fruit was, I 
finally broke dou-n and did what I could havcdonelnthe first place. I weal down to 
the physical plant and asked them about il. I dldn'l want to dotlial right off — that 
would have taken all the fun oul of things. 

So I looked oi'cr a few tMoks. asked a few people who might have known whal il 
was, and managed to comeclcselo finding out what I wasafler

Down al the physical plant 1 met Don Kaller. the pLint's direclor, who has been 
with the uiuvcrslly for the last ID years. "Japanese Quince," he told mo. "It's 
edible bul ." was the warning he gave me. 

When I bit Into that fruit a wliole new dimension opened up before me. II is ul- 
ICTly impossible to eiperience "bad" without tasting a Japanese Quince. II defiet 
description, the taste of thai thiogl Worse yet, Il Isn't content lo nail you lo the wall 
with Its initial contact. U has an afterlasle that would gag a skunk I From now on 
I'll call themToto'srevaige. 

Kolto- is a friendly, easygoing son of person, and he got a chuckle oul of my 
■ecounloflhetasteoftheiiuince. "It 's a very common ornamental." hcsald."Ilii 
a Bpring flowering shrub that jusl happens to produce fruit, but you'd have lo be 
mighty hiaigry to eaione." 

Personally, after having tasted one. I'd opl (or starving, '■The rabbits love 
them," Kaller said. "TTicy will mow 'em off for us every other year or so. Hie 
stuaentscan'idothedamage to ihem the rabbits ik&gt;." 

That made me decide that I'd ncxer hunt rabbits anywhere cteelo the campus. 
I figure the Tola's revenge would ta inl the meal. 

As far as Adam and Eve goea, I've got la hand it to Adam, He was a better man 
than lam Had I beenhimandEvehadgirenmeoncof those quince. 1 likely would 
have sent her off wilhlhe snake. I'm not sure I'd live wilha woman thai mean- 
To anybody who's curious, 1 Jiot checked the planter. Tlie only thing that's 
grown so far is mold and somehow, 1 Just can't feel bad about that.

story. Dennis is a good- 


looking teenage (oothall hero 




Amie isn't completely killed

K anythmg borderline happy 



Pl&gt;moulh Fury laptly

darker personality emerges 
— a personality strangely 
akin to that of the car's 
previous owner, LeBay, 
LcBay is a man so filled with 

a human bemg and instead 
has become something o[ an 
apparition made solely for 
wrath and revenge. The 
evolution of this is a brilliant 
study in paranoia As Dennis 
tries to intercede end help 
Arnie, he becomes the focus 



Ghastly things start to 
happen. Some hoodlums who 
lore up Amie's work on tbe 
car start to disappear or die 
grisly automotive deaths. 
Amie's new-found girlfriend, 
Leigh, starts to think d 
(3iristine as a malevolent 
female force trying to 
remove her from Amie's 
IiFb. Amie's parents are 
[aced with their son's in- 
creasing independence, 
which is hard enough for 
parents of teenagers 
everywhere, but when the 
independence is ac- 
companied by ■ complete, 
frightening character, 
change, they are driven to 
extremes to try to gel their 
SOI tiack. Everyone around 
Amie Is caught up In this
